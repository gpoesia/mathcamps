        John has been learning to add and subtract fractions at school. He was given a problem during his homework that puzzled him. He had to take the sum of 48/56 and 95/23 and then subtract 34/26 from the result. What was the value that John found for this operation? Answer in simplest form.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Step 1: Add the first two fractions
48/56 + 95/23
To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) of 56 and 23 is 1288.

48/56 = 864/1288
95/23 = 1240/1288

864/1288 + 1240/1288 = 2104/1288

Step 2: Subtract the third fraction
2104/1288 - 34/26
To subtract fractions, we need to convert the second fraction to have the same denominator as the first.
34/26 = 442/1288

2104/1288 - 442/1288 = 1662/1288

Step 3: Simplify the final result
1662/1288 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 8.
1662/1288 = 207.75/161

        First, add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65. Then subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result. What is the result expressed as a simple fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Step 1: Add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65.
To add fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD).
The LCD of 9 and 65 is 585.
So we convert the fractions to have the same denominator of 585:
88/9 = 6520/585
28/65 = 260/585
Now we can add the fractions:
6520/585 + 260/585 = 6780/585

Step 2: Subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result.
Again, we need to convert the fractions to have the same denominator.
The LCD of 585 and 37 is 21645.
6780/585 = 21780/21645
18/37 = 486/21645
Now we can subtract the fractions:
21780/21645 - 486/21645 = 21294/21645

Step 3: Express the result as a simple fraction.
To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 21294 and 21645 is 21.
Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 21, we get:
21294/21645 = 1014/1030

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) (63 / 41) + (44 / 50)
2) First, let's calculate the individual fractions:
(63 / 41) = 1.53658536585366
(44 / 50) = 0.88

3) Now, we add the two fractions:
1.53658536585366 + 0.88 = 2.41658536585366

4) To simplify this to the lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The numerator is 2.41658536585366 and the denominator is 1.
The GCF of 2.41658536585366 and 1 is 1.

5) Dividing both the numerator and denominator by the GCF of 1, we get:
2.41658536585366 / 1 = 2.41658536585366

1) John had 71/41 of a cake left.
2) Emily added 41/77 of another cake to it.
3) To find the total amount of cake, we need to add the two fractions together.
4) To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 41 and 77 is 3157.
5) 71/41 = 5477/3157 and 41/77 = 1547/3157.
6) 5477/3157 + 1547/3157 = 7024/3157.
7) To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 7.

1) We need to find a common denominator for the two fractions.
2) The least common multiple of 81 and 47 is 3,807.
3) To convert 75/81 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 3,807, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 47:
75/81 = (75 * 47) / (81 * 47) = 3,525 / 3,807
4) To convert 97/47 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 3,807, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 81:
97/47 = (97 * 81) / (47 * 81) = 7,857 / 3,807
5) Now we can add the fractions:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We found the result of adding 75/81 and 97/47 to be 11,382/3,807.

2) Now we need to add 52/71 to that result.

3) To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3,807 and 71 is 270,297.

4) Convert 11,382/3,807 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 270,297:
11,382/3,807 = (11,382 * 71) / (3,807 * 71) = 807,282/270,297

5) Convert 52/71 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 270,297:
52/71 = (52 * 3,807) / (71 * 3,807) = 197,964/270,297

   96/11 + 12/5 = (96 * 5 + 11 * 12) / (11 * 5)
   = (480 + 132) / 55
   = 612 / 55

2. Next, we need to subtract 38/87 from the sum.
   612/55 - 38/87 = (612 * 87 - 38 * 55) / (55 * 87)
   = (53,244 - 2,090) / 4,785
   = 51,154 / 4,785

3. Finally, we need to add the result back to the initial sum.
   612/55 + 51,154/4,785 = (612 * 4,785 + 51,154 * 55) / (55 * 4,785)
   = (2,928,420 + 2,813,470) / 262,175
   = 5,741,890 / 262,175

Therefore, the final result is 5,741,890/262,175.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the total number of fruits you started with.
   Oranges: 96/58
   Apples: 12/5
   Total fruits = 96/58 + 12/5 = (96 * 5 + 58 * 12) / (58 * 5)
   = (480 + 696) / 290
   = 1,176 / 290

2. Now, we need to subtract 38/87 of the total fruits for charity.
   Total fruits - 38/87 = (1,176 * 87 - 38 * 290) / (290 * 87)
   = (102,312 - 11,020) / 25,230
   = 91,292 / 25,230

Therefore, the fraction of fruits you have left is 91,292/25,230.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) 82 divided by 9 is 9.11 (rounded to two decimal places).
2) 82 divided by 63 is 1.30 (rounded to two decimal places).
3) Now we subtract 1.30 from 9.11:
9.11 - 1.30 = 7.81

To express this as a simplified fraction, we need to find the common denominator. The least common denominator of 9 and 63 is 567.

9.11 = 511/63

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We have two fractions to add: 33/41 and 95/62.

2) To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) of 41 and 62 is 2,822 (the least common multiple of 41 and 62).

3) Now we need to convert the fractions to have the same denominator of 2,822:
33/41 = (33 * 69)/2,822 = 2,277/2,822
95/62 = (95 * 46)/2,822 = 4,370/2,822

4) Now we can add the fractions:
2,277/2,822 + 4,370/2,822 = 6,647/2,822

5) To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.

To add fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) first. The LCD of 73 and 77 is 5621.

83/73 = 5621/5621
53/77 = 4081/5621

Now we can add the numerators:

This simplified fraction is 'w'.

Step 2: Add 80/76 to 'w'
The LCD of 5621 and 76 is 426,796.

9702/5621 = 1,726,796/426,796
80/76 = 426,796/426,796

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate 94 / 2 - 74 / 57
94 / 2 = 47
74 / 57 = 1.2982456140350877
47 - 1.2982456140350877 = 45.7017543859649

Step 2: Add the result to 56 / 97
45.7017543859649 + 56 / 97 = 45.7017543859649 + 0.5773195876288659 = 46.2790739735938

Step 3: Express the final result as a fraction
46.2790739735938 = 46 + 0.2790739735938
The fractional part is 0.2790739735938
To express this as a fraction, we need to find the denominator.
The denominator will be 1 followed by the number of decimal places, which is 10 in this case.
So the final fraction is 279/1000.

Step 2: Add 'd' to the third fraction (99/59).
'd' + 99/59 = (7125/2940 + 99*2940/59*2940) / 2940

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate ((8 / 91) + (49 / 5))
(8 / 91) = 0.0879
(49 / 5) = 9.8
0.0879 + 9.8 = 9.8879

Step 2: Subtract (32 / 76) from the result

68/85 = (68 * 45)/3825 = 3060/3825

4) Now we can add the fractions:
4386/3825 + 3060/3825 = 7446/3825

5) To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 7446 and 3825 is 15.
Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 15, we get:
7446/3825 = 496/255

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We have the fraction 90/81 and we need to add it to 2/66.

2) To add fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD). The LCD of 81 and 66 is 2,646.

3) Now we need to convert the fractions to have the same denominator of 2,646:
90/81 = (90 * 32.67)/2,646 = 2,940/2,646
2/66 = (2 * 40.09)/2,646 = 80.18/2,646

4) Now we can add the fractions:
2,940/2,646 + 80.18/2,646 = 3,020.18/2,646

5) To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 3,020.18 and 2,646 is 2.18.

6) Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2.18, we get:

        After completing the initial calculation, you realize there was an extra component to your math problem. You must now also add the fraction 38/53 to your previous result. What is the new total, expressed as a simplified fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's incorporate the additional step:

Step 1: Take the whole number 51 and add it to the fraction 93/8.
51 + 93/8 = (51 * 8 + 93) / 8 = (408 + 93) / 8 = 501/8

Step 2: Take the sum from Step 1 and add it to the fraction 58/44.
501/8 + 58/44 = (501 * 44 + 58 * 8) / (8 * 44) = (22044 + 464) / 352 = 22508/352

Step 3: Add the fraction 38/53 to the previous result.
22508/352 + 38/53 = ((22508 * 53) + (38 * 352)) / (352 * 53) 
= (1192924 + 13376) / 18656 
= 1206300/18656

Step 4: Simplify the final result as a fraction.
The greatest common factor of 1206300 and 18656 is 4.
Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4 gives:
1206300/18656 = 301575/4664

2) To find the sum, we need to find a common denominator.
3) The least common denominator (LCD) of 2 and 25 is 50.
4) So we need to convert the fractions to have a denominator of 50:
   7/2 = 7 * 25/50 = 175/50
   51/25 = 51 * 2/50 = 102/50
5) Now we can add the fractions:
   175/50 + 102/50 = 277/50

To write the answer as a simple fraction, we need to simplify the fraction 277/50.

4) So we need to convert the fractions to have a denominator of 390:
   7/2 = 7 * 195/390 = 1365/390
   51/25 = 51 * 16/390 = 816/390
   86/39 = 86 * 10/390 = 860/390
5) Now we can add the fractions:
   1365/390 + 816/390 + 860/390 = 3041/390

To write the answer as a simple fraction, we need to simplify the fraction 3041/390.

2. This first expression is a monomial, so we can add it to the second expression: (3 / 46)
   - (3 / 46) = 0.06521739130434783

3. Now we add the two expressions together:
   - 14.271221532091116 + 0.06521739130434783 = 14.336438923395464

4. To express the final result as a simple fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, and then divide both by the GCD.
   - The numerator is 14336438923395464
   - The denominator is 1000000000000000
   - The GCD of the numerator and denominator is 1000000000

Step 2: Calculate the second term (74 / 43)
74 / 43 = 74 / 43

Step 3: Add the first two terms

81 / 61 = 1.3278688524590164
This can be simplified to 81/61 = 27/20

Step 3: Add the two fractions
(25/22) + (27/20) = (25*20 + 22*27) / (22*20)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We have two identical fractions, t, each equal to the sum of 53/18 and 21/99.

2. To find the value of t, we need to add the two fractions:
t = 53/18 + 21/99

3. To add the fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD). The LCD of 18 and 99 is 1782.

4. Converting the fractions to have the same denominator of 1782:
53/18 = 295/1782
21/99 = 21/1782

5. Now we can add the fractions:
t = 295/1782 + 21/1782 = 316/1782

6. The total sum, l, of the two identical fractions, t, is:
l = 2 × t = 2 × 316/1782 = 632/1782

7. To simplify the fraction 632/1782, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 14.

1. Evan has read 51/18 of the novel.
2. Olivia has read (8/42) after reading the same amount as Evan.
   * This means Olivia has read (8/42) + (51/18) of the novel.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find a common denominator:

3) This gave him a total of 'k' gallons.
4) Later, he received 47/71 gallons from Sally.

To find the total number of gallons Alex had, we need to first calculate the total amount of orange juice he had after buying the additional 77/5 gallons.

Initial amount: 69/63 gallons
Additional amount: 77/5 gallons
Total after buying additional: 69/63 + 77/5 = (69*5 + 77*63) / (63*5) = (345 + 4851) / 315 = 5196 / 315 = 'k' gallons

Now, he received an additional 47/71 gallons from Sally.
Total amount: 'k' + 47/71 gallons

To find the final total, we need to simplify the fractions and add them together:
'k' + 47/71 = (5196/315) + (47/71) = (5196*71 + 47*315) / (315*71) = (368,916 + 14,805) / 22,365 = 383,721 / 22,365 = 17.16 gallons

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) ((100 / 61) + ((39 / 6) + (67 / 49)))
2) First, let's calculate the individual parts:
   a) 100 / 61 = 1.639344262295082
   b) 39 / 6 = 6.5
   c) 67 / 49 = 1.3673469387755102

3) Now, let's add them up:
   1.639344262295082 + (6.5 + 1.3673469387755102) = 9.406690201070592

4) To simplify the fraction, we need to find the common denominator. The least common multiple of 61, 6, and 49 is 2,646.

5) Multiplying the numerators and denominators to get the simplified fraction:
   (9.406690201070592 * 2,646) / 2,646 = 24,900 / 2,646

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We need to find the common denominator for the two fractions.
The least common multiple of 13 and 86 is 1,118.

2) Now we can convert the fractions to have the same denominator:
92/13 = (92 * 86) / (13 * 86) = 7,912 / 1,118
43/86 = (43 * 13) / (86 * 13) = 559 / 1,118

3) Now we can add the numerators:
7,912 / 1,118 + 559 / 1,118 = 8,471 / 1,118

4) To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator.

2) Now we need to add 36/72 to this sum.
To do this, we need to convert 36/72 to have the same denominator of 1,118.
36/72 = (36 * 15) / (72 * 15) = 540 / 1,118

3) Now we can add the three fractions together:
8,471/1,118 + 540/1,118 = 9,011/1,118

4) To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) Add the fractions:
78/66 + 28/6 + 90/34

2) First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of the fractions. The LCD is the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 198.

3) Now we need to convert each fraction to have a denominator of 198:
78/66 = (78 * 3)/198 = 234/198
28/6 = (28 * 33)/198 = 924/198 
90/34 = (90 * 6)/198 = 540/198

4) Now we can add the fractions:
234/198 + 924/198 + 540/198 = 1698/198

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to find the sum of 95/18 and 51/61.
95/18 + 51/61 = (95 * 61 + 51 * 18) / (18 * 61)
= (5,795 + 918) / 1,098
= 6,713 / 1,098
= 6.11

2) Now we need to represent the answer as a simplified fraction.
To do this, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 6,713 and 1,098 is 3.
Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3, we get:
6,713 / 3 = 2,237
1,098 / 3 = 366

1) We have 34/1 and 53/4
2) To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) of 1 and 4 is 4.
3) So we need to convert 34/1 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 4.
4) 34/1 = 34/1 * 4/4 = 136/4

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The wholesaler initially has 41/26 barrels of olive oil in their warehouse.
2) They sell a portion of the oil which is equivalent to 41/72 barrels.
3) To find how much olive oil they have now, we need to subtract the amount they sold from the initial amount.

The initial amount: 41/26 barrels
The amount they sold: 41/72 barrels

To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 26 and 72 is 312.

41/26 = 156/312
41/72 = 156/312

Now we can subtract:
156/312 - 156/312 = 0/312

Therefore, the amount of olive oil they have now is 0/312, which can be simplified to 0/1.
