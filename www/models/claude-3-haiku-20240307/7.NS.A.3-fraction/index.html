        Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Carla initially calculated the number of cucumbers per plant by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19.
   * 22/3 * 22/19 = (22 * 22) / (3 * 19) = 484 / 57 = 8.4912 cucumbers per plant

2. Carla then realized she could increase her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17.
   * 8.4912 * (23/17) = 8.4912 * 1.3529 = 11.4912 cucumbers per plant

Therefore, Carla is expecting to grow 11.4912 cucumbers per plant after adjusting her production method.

        Pierre has 19/4 kg of grapes. One afternoon, he ate 7/25 kg of them. In the evening, his mother gave him 30/9 kg more grapes. How many kilograms of grapes does Pierre have now?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Pierre initially had 19/4 kg of grapes.
2) In the afternoon, he ate 7/25 kg of the grapes.
   * To find how much he had left, we subtract 7/25 kg from 19/4 kg:
   * 19/4 - 7/25 = (19*25 - 7*4) / (4*25) = 475/100 - 28/100 = 447/100 kg
3) In the evening, his mother gave him 30/9 kg more grapes.
   * To find his new total, we add 30/9 kg to the 447/100 kg he had left:
   * 447/100 + 30/9 = (447*9 + 30*100) / (100*9) = 4023/900 + 3000/900 = 7023/900 kg

        In hindsight, Pierre realized he initially had less grapes than he thought. He actually started with 19/14 kg of grapes instead of 19/4 kg. He still ate 7/25 kg of grapes that afternoon, and his mother gave him the same amount, 30/9 kg, of additional grapes in the evening. Now how many kilograms of grapes does Pierre have?

1) Pierre initially had 19/14 kg of grapes.
2) In the afternoon, he ate 7/25 kg of the grapes.

        King Arthur is calculating the costs for restoring his castle. The wall repairs cost 26/22 of his castle's annual budget. Meanwhile, the moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget. Finally, installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget. How much (expressed as a fraction of the castle's annual budget) has King Arthur spent on these projects in total?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Wall repairs cost 26/22 of the castle's annual budget.
2. Moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget.
3. Installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget.

To find the total amount spent, we need to add up these three fractions:

Wall repairs: 26/22
Moat renovations: 4/29
Catapults: 11/3

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 22, 29, and 3 is 174.

26/22 = 78/174
4/29 = 24/174 
11/3 = 58/174

Adding these together:
78/174 + 24/174 + 58/174 = 160/174

Therefore, the total amount King Arthur has spent on these projects is 160/174 of the castle's annual budget.

1. The giraffe is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves.
2. The giraffe eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day.
3. The zoo calculates the weekly feeding amount by:
   a. Multiplying the daily intake by itself (making the result &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;)
   b. Then multiplying that with the regular daily intake.

Let's start by calculating the daily intake:
Daily intake = (25/19) * (30/26) = (750/494) lbs

Now, let's calculate the &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;:
Weekly feeding amount squared = ((25/19) * (30/26))^2 = (750/494)^2 = 562500/243616 = 2.31 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

Finally, let's multiply the &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot; by the regular daily intake:
Weekly feeding amount = (562500/243616) * (750/494) = 1302.08 lbs (rounded to 2 decimal places)

1. The necklace requires (11/3) feet of yarn.
2. Lara also wants to add smaller beads which will extend the length of the necklace by (8/30) feet.

To find the total length of materials Lara will need, we need to add the length of the yarn and the length added by the beads.

Length of yarn: (11/3) feet
Length added by beads: (8/30) feet

Total length of materials needed = Length of yarn + Length added by beads
                            = (11/3) + (8/30)
                            = (11 * 10 + 8 * 3) / (3 * 10)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Plane A is flying at a speed of 24/11 miles per minute.
2. Plane B is flying at a speed of 26/27 miles per minute.
3. They both depart at the same time and fly for exactly one minute.

To find the distance traveled by each plane, we multiply the speed by the time:
* Plane A traveled: 24/11 miles/minute × 1 minute = 24/11 miles
* Plane B traveled: 26/27 miles/minute × 1 minute = 26/27 miles

Now, to find the difference in distance traveled:
* Plane A - Plane B = (24/11) - (26/27) miles
* Simplifying the difference:
* (24/11) - (26/27) = (24*27 - 26*11) / (11*27)

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, you had 28 out of 29 chocolate bars.
2) Then, you found 8 out of 22 more chocolate bars.

To find the total chocolate bars you have now, we need to add the initial amount and the new amount together.

Initial amount: 28 out of 29 chocolate bars
New amount: 8 out of 22 chocolate bars

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator is 638 (29 * 22).

So the initial amount becomes: 
28 * 22 / 29 = 616 / 638

And the new amount becomes:
8 * 29 / 22 = 232 / 638

Adding these together:
616 / 638 + 232 / 638 = 848 / 638

Therefore, the total chocolate bars you have now is represented by the fraction 848/638.

The compass needle is made from a special material. It takes 27/26 of a pound to create one needle. 

If the maker is trying to produce two identical needles, how much material will he require? 

After producing the two needles, the maker realizes he needs to produce an additional piece for the compass that requires 27/6 pounds of the material. 

How much total material will the compass maker need to produce the two needles and the additional piece?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. To create one compass needle, it takes 27/26 of a pound of the special material.

2. The maker is trying to produce two identical needles, so the total amount of material required for the two needles is:
   2 needles x 27/26 pounds per needle = 54/26 pounds

3. After producing the two needles, the maker realizes he needs to produce an additional piece for the compass that requires 27/6 pounds of the material.

4. To find the total material required, we add the amount for the two needles and the additional piece:
   54/26 pounds + 27/6 pounds = (54/26) + (27/6) pounds

Simplifying the fractions:
(54/26) + (27/6) = (108/52) + (135/52) = 243/52 pounds

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first candle burns at a rate of 6/4 inches per hour.
2. The second candle burns at a rate of 14/16 inches per hour.

To find the total rate at which the two candles burn together, we need to add the two rates together.

First, let's convert the rates to the same unit:

Candle 1 rate: 6/4 inches per hour = 1.5 inches per hour
Candle 2 rate: 14/16 inches per hour = 0.875 inches per hour

Now we can add the two rates together:
Total rate = 1.5 inches per hour + 0.875 inches per hour = 2.375 inches per hour

        Imagine you're a music producer who is working on a new song. Your resources are divided into different sections.

- First, you dedicate 16/4 hours to composing the music and another 16/29 hours to writing the lyrics. This is your initial time investment for the song (let's call it p).

- Then, you spend 28/13 hours for mixing and mastering the song in addition to the initial time investment (let's call this new total time b).

- Suddenly, a drummer you hired for a session uses 18/4 hours less because he finished his parts quickly.

What is the final time you spent on producing the song, if your total time is expressed as (b - (18 / 4))?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial time investment for the song:
   - Composing the music: 16/4 hours
   - Writing the lyrics: 16/29 hours
   - Total initial time (p) = 16/4 + 16/29 hours

2. Time spent for mixing and mastering the song:
   - 28/13 hours
   - Total time (b) = p + 28/13 hours

3. Time saved due to the drummer finishing his parts quickly:
   - 18/4 hours less

4. Final time spent on producing the song:
   - Total time (b) - 18/4 hours

Now, let's calculate the final time:

p = 16/4 + 16/29 = 4 + 0.55 = 4.55 hours
b = p + 28/13 = 4.55 + 2.15 = 6.7 hours
Final time = b - 18/4 = 6.7 - 4.5 = 2.2 hours

1. Monica initially has 21/15 dozens of cookies.

2. Later, she bakes an additional 29/17 dozens of cookies.

To find the total number of dozens of cookies she has after the additional baking, we need to add the two amounts:
21/15 + 29/17 = (21*17 + 29*15) / (15*17)
= (357 + 435) / 255
= 792 / 255
= 3.11 dozens

3. Now, Monica decides to increase her total stock by a ratio of 7/5.
This means she will multiply her current total (3.11 dozens) by 7/5.

2) The chef starts with 28 kg of sugar.
3) After making one cake, the amount of sugar used is 26/24 kg.
4) The chef then adds 10/6 kg of sugar to their supply.

To calculate the amount of sugar left:
* Sugar used for one cake: 26/24 kg
* Sugar added: 10/6 kg
* Sugar left = 28 kg - 26/24 kg + 10/6 kg
* Sugar left = 28 - (26/24) + (10/6)
* Sugar left = 28 - (26/24) + (50/24)
* Sugar left = 28 - (26/24) + (50/24)
* Sugar left = 28 - (26/24) + (50/24)

* Princess Lily ate 10 out of 12 slices of apple pie
* She ate 10 out of 29 slices of blueberry pie
* To find the total amount of pie she ate, we need to add the fractions of each pie she ate

For the apple pie:
* She ate 10 out of 12 slices
* This can be represented as the fraction 10/12

For the blueberry pie:
* She ate 10 out of 29 slices
* This can be represented as the fraction 10/29

Now we add the fractions:
* 10/12 + 10/29 = (10*29 + 10*12) / (12*29)
* = (290 + 120) / 348

        A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspect’s involvement. Calculate the value of f.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate the indicator i
For the first specimen, the value decreases by 26 out of every 6 units.
For the second specimen, the value decreases by 25 out of every 17 units.

To find the ratio of these changes, we need to find the common denominator.
The common denominator is the least common multiple of 6 and 17, which is 102.

Now we can express the changes as:
First specimen: 26 out of 102 units
Second specimen: 25 out of 102 units

The ratio of these changes is:
i = 26/102 : 25/102 = 26:25

Step 2: Calculate the indicator h
For the first specimen, the value increases by 18 out of every 8 units.
For the second specimen, the value increases by 17 out of every 23 units.

To find the difference between these rates, we need to find the common denominator.
The common denominator is the least common multiple of 8 and 23, which is 184.

Now we can express the changes as:
First specimen: 18 out of 184 units
Second specimen: 17 out of 184 units

The difference between these rates is:
h = 18/184 - 17/184 = 1/184

Step 3: Calculate the indicator f
The final evidence factor, indicator f, is the product of indicators h and i.
f = h × i
f = (1/184) × (26:25)
f = 26/4600

Lioness gestation period: 20/22 of a year
Giraffe gestation period: 15 years
Total gestation period = Lioness gestation period + Giraffe gestation period
Total gestation period = (20/22) + 15 = 15.91 years

Step 2: Calculate the reduced gestation period for the lioness's second pregnancy.
Reduced gestation period = Original total gestation period - (15/20 of a year)

4. To find the area of the similar rectangle, we multiply the area of the original rectangle by 18/17:
   Area of similar rectangle = (13.57 * 18)/17 = 14.4 square meters.

        A soap factory produces 23/8 tonnes of soap each day. One day, they decided to increase production by an extra 4/20 of a tonne. However, later that same day, they reduce the production by 19/24 of a tonne due to a sudden power cut. How many tonnes of soap does the factory produce that day after these adjustments?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The factory initially produces 23/8 tonnes of soap each day.

2. They then increase production by an extra 4/20 of a tonne.
   * So the new production amount is 23/8 + 4/20 = 184/160 + 4/20 = 188/160 tonnes.

3. Later that same day, they reduce the production by 19/24 of a tonne.
   * So the final production amount is 188/160 - 19/24 = 2,880/2,400 - 475/600 = 2,405/2,400 tonnes.

Step 1: Calculate the daily toothpaste usage for Sonia.
Sonia uses 21/12 oz of toothpaste daily.

Step 2: Calculate the daily toothpaste usage for Anthony.
Anthony uses 6/27 oz of toothpaste daily.

Step 3: Add the daily toothpaste usage for Sonia and Anthony.
Total daily toothpaste usage for Sonia and Anthony = 21/12 + 6/27
To add these fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD).
The LCD of 12 and 27 is 108.
21/12 = 175/108
6/27 = 4/108
Total daily toothpaste usage for Sonia and Anthony = 175/108 + 4/108 = 179/108

Step 4: Add the daily toothpaste usage for the mom.
The mom uses 3/18 oz of toothpaste daily.
To add this to the total, we need to convert 3/18 to the LCD of 108.
3/18 = 6/108
Final total daily toothpaste usage for the whole family = 179/108 + 6/108 = 185/108

        Let's suppose for a special recipe sandwich, you need to divide a wheel of cheese into 14 equal parts and a pickle jar into 18 equal parts. 

To make one special sandwich, you need 21 parts of the wheel of cheese and 7 parts from the pickle jar.

You've just made these sandwiches and you are down to ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of your original ingredients.

1) The first window is 15/6 meters tall.
2) The second window is 7/16 meters tall.
3) To find the total height of the two windows, we need to add the heights together.

To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator.
The least common denominator of 6 and 16 is 48.

15/6 = 15 * 8/48 = 120/48
7/16 = 7 * 3/48 = 21/48

Now we can add the heights:

3) To find the total points earned, we need to multiply the points per level (4/3) by the number of levels played (13/10).

4/3 points per level x 13/10 levels played = (4/3) * (13/10) = 52/30 points

3. The total time spent on these two activities is the astronaut's &quot;work&quot; routine.
4. The astronaut adds 30/8 hours of reviewing data to his &quot;work&quot; routine.

Time spent cycling: 18/8 hours
Time spent conducting experiments: 26/2 hours
Time spent reviewing data: 30/8 hours

Total time spent on the whole daily routine:
18/8 + 26/2 + 30/8 hours

To simplify this expression, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions:

1. Jeremy ordered slices of cheese that weighed 30/9 ounces in total.
2. He found that there was 17/22 ounces less cheese than he requested.
3. We can use the equation d = n - (17/22) to find the actual amount of cheese he received.
   * d = amount of cheese received
   * n = amount of cheese ordered (30/9 ounces)
   * 17/22 = amount less than ordered

Plugging in the values:
d = 30/9 - (17/22)
d = (30/9) - (17/22)
d = (30 * 22) / (9 * 22) - 17/22
d = (660/198) - 17/22
d = 3.33 - 0.77
d = 2.56 ounces

        Sophia is a researcher who studies sunglasses. She was examining a batch of sunglasses and trying to calculate the average light blocking efficiency.

In the first test, she found that 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays completely, while in the second test, 20 out of every 18 sunglasses also blocked all UV rays.

Sophia decided to add these numbers to her total. Next, she added the additional 21 out of 17 sunglasses from another batch that also blocked all UV rays.

Later, she realized she made a mistake and needed to subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that actually did not block all UV rays.

What is the final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays, according to Sophia's tests and calculations? Please give your answer as a simplified fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first test, 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays completely.
   This means the fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 13/4.

2. In the second test, 20 out of every 18 sunglasses blocked all UV rays.
   This means the fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 20/18.

3. Sophia added these two fractions together:
   13/4 + 20/18 = 39/18

4. Sophia then added the additional 21 out of 17 sunglasses that blocked all UV rays.
   The new total is: 39/18 + 21/17

5. Sophia then realized she needed to subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that did not block all UV rays.
   The final corrected number is: (39/18 + 21/17) - 16/30

        Shawn is making sandwiches for a picnic. The recipe for the sandwiches requires different amounts of mayonnaise and sandwich spread. 

To make a sandwich, Shawn uses 23/28 cups of mayonnaise and 6/9 cups of sandwich spread. How many cups of these two ingredients does Shawn use in total to make a sandwich?

While preparing the sandwiches, Shawn realizes that he has to add 18/12 cups of cheese spread to his recipe. Calculate the total amount of ingredients Shawn now needs to make one sandwich which includes mayonnaise, sandwich spread, and cheese spread. 

Finally, if Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, how many cups of ingredients will he use in total to make those sandwiches?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of mayonnaise and sandwich spread needed for one sandwich.
Mayonnaise: 23/28 cups
Sandwich spread: 6/9 cups
Total: 23/28 + 6/9 = 69/84 + 48/84 = 117/84 cups

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of ingredients needed for one sandwich, including the cheese spread.
Mayonnaise: 23/28 cups
Sandwich spread: 6/9 cups
Cheese spread: 18/12 cups
Total: 23/28 + 6/9 + 18/12 = 69/84 + 48/84 + 108/84 = 225/84 cups

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of ingredients needed to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined.
Total ingredients per sandwich: 225/84 cups
Number of sandwiches: 4/4 cups / 225/84 cups per sandwich = 16 sandwiches
Total ingredients needed: 16 sandwiches x 225/84 cups per sandwich = 3600/84 cups

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Cassandra initially had a collection equivalent to 7/6 of a key set.
2) She then lost 1/21 of a key set.
3) To find how many key sets she has now, we need to subtract the amount she lost from the initial amount.

The initial amount was 7/6 of a key set.
The amount she lost was 1/21 of a key set.

To subtract these, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 6 and 21 is 126.

7/6 of a key set = 105/126 of a key set.
1/21 of a key set = 6/126 of a key set.

Subtracting the amount lost from the initial amount:
105/126 - 6/126 = 99/126 of a key set.

        You're trying to solve a puzzle that requires you to multiply two fractions together. The fractions are 22/25 and 22/8. Calculate the product to get the answer you need to advance in the puzzle.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

To multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

The first fraction is 22/25.
The second fraction is 22/8.

To find the product, we multiply the numerators:
22 x 22 = 484

And we multiply the denominators:
25 x 8 = 200

So the product of the two fractions is:
484/200

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4.

484/4 = 121
200/4 = 50

Therefore, the final product is:
121/50

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

In the previous step, we calculated the product of the two fractions 22/25 and 22/8, which resulted in the fraction 121/50.

Now, we need to add this fraction to the number on the key, which is 23/13.

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 50 and 13 is 650.

So we convert the fractions to have a denominator of 650:
121/50 = 121 * 13/13 * 50 = 1573/650
23/13 = 23 * 50/13 * 50 = 1150/650

Now we can add the fractions:
1573/650 + 1150/650 = 2723/650

To simplify, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 5.

2723/5 = 544.6
650/5 = 130

Therefore, the sum of the two values is:
544.6/130

3. There is a collective loss of 6/15 hours due to a break delay.
4. The manager extends the working hours by the same amount of time as the initial time span of the process.

First, let's calculate the total time required for the entire process:
* Editing time: 20/5 hours

* Time lost = 6/15 hours = 0.4 hours

Next, let's calculate the extended working hours:
* Extended working hours = 4.0588 + 0.4 = 4.4588 hours

        In a beehive, there are sections for honey storage and bee rearing. Each section is classified into many sub-sections. One day, the beekeeper discovered that each honey storage sub-section had (25 / 9) gallons of honey. He also found the same amount of honey in each bee rearing sub-section. 

If he combined the honey from both a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the beekeeper would have a total quantity represented by 'p'. 

However, one honey storage sub-section had an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey. So, if the beekeeper was calculating the total amount from this sub-section plus a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be defined as 's'. 

What quantity of honey ('s') would the beekeeper have in total from this scenario?

At night, the dinosaur eats 6/17 bunches of leaves per hour.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Day 1: The bear ate 28/6 pounds of fish.
Day 2: The bear ate 21/18 pounds of fish.
Day 3: The bear ate 24/22 pounds of fish.

To find the total pounds of fish the bear ate in these three days, we need to add up the amounts from each day:

28/6 + 21/18 + 24/22

To add fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) first.
The LCD of 6, 18, and 22 is 198.

So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 198:
28/6 = 594/198
21/18 = 231/198 
24/22 = 216/198

Now we can add them up:
594/198 + 231/198 + 216/198 = 1041/198

Therefore, the total pounds of fish the bear ate in these three days is 1041/198.

        Heather was preparing a special three-course dinner for her family. 

For the first course, she had a bread recipe that required 11/17 of a cup of sugar. In addition, she baked a custard for dessert that required another 6/2 cups of sugar. 

As her family loves sweet dishes, she decided to increase the total quantity of sugar by a factor of 29/21. How many cups of sugar did Heather use in total?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. For the first course, the bread recipe required 11/17 of a cup of sugar.

2. For the dessert, the custard recipe required 6/2 = 3 cups of sugar.

3. Heather decided to increase the total quantity of sugar by a factor of 29/21.

To calculate the total amount of sugar used:
* First, we need to find the total amount of sugar before the increase:
  - Bread recipe: 11/17 cups
  - Custard recipe: 3 cups
  - Total before increase: 11/17 + 3 = 3 + 11/17 cups

* Now, we increase the total by a factor of 29/21:
  - Total after increase: (3 + 11/17) * 29/21 cups

Simplifying the calculation:
* (3 + 11/17) * 29/21 = (51/17 + 11/17) * 29/21 = 62/17 * 29/21 = 1798/357 cups

2. The custard recipe still requires 3 cups of sugar.
3. Heather is still increasing the total quantity of sugar by a factor of 29/21.

Calculating the new total:
* Bread recipe: 11/25 cups
* Custard recipe: 3 cups
* Total before increase: 11/25 + 3 = 3 + 11/25 cups

* Increasing the total by 29/21:
  - Total after increase: (3 + 11/25) * 29/21 cups

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) ((7 / 8) + (21 / 18))

The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72.
3) So we convert the fractions to have a denominator of 72:
(7 / 8) = (63 / 72)
(21 / 18) = (42 / 72)
4) Now we can add the fractions:
(63 / 72) + (42 / 72) = (105 / 72)
5) To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator.
The greatest common factor of 105 and 72 is 9.

1. Guests' consumption:
   - Water: 15/7 gallons per guest
   - Wine: 15/24 gallons per guest
   - Total liquid consumed per guest = 15/7 + 15/24 = 45/84 gallons

2. Baker's requirement:
   - Milk: 26/20 gallons per cake

3. Multiply the baker's requirement by the number of guests:
   - Liquid required for cakes = 26/20 * i gallons

4. Add the guests' consumption to the liquid required for cakes:
   - Total liquid needed = (45/84 * i) + (26/20 * i) = x gallons

Simplifying the expression:
x = (45/84 + 26/20) * i
x = (45 * 20 + 26 * 84) / (84 * 20)
x = (900 + 2184) / 1680

1. The first model takes 17/10 hours to assemble.
2. The second model takes 12/23 hours to assemble.

To find the difference in time, we need to subtract the time for the second model from the time for the first model.

17/10 - 12/23 = (17 * 23 - 12 * 10) / (10 * 23)
= (391 - 120) / 230

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 17.

271 / 17 = 15 9/17
230 / 17 = 13 5/17

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The initial speed of the car was 13/4 miles per minute.

2. The car then reduced its speed by 14/15 miles per minute.
   * To calculate the new speed, we subtract 14/15 from the initial speed of 13/4:
   * 13/4 - 14/15 = (13 * 15 - 14 * 4) / (4 * 15) = 195 - 56 / 60 = 139/60 miles per minute

3. The car then increased its speed by 30/15 miles per minute.
   * To calculate the final speed, we add 30/15 to the previous speed of 139/60:
   * 139/60 + 30/15 = (139 * 15 + 30 * 4) / (60 * 15) = 2085 + 120 / 900 = 2205/900 miles per minute

        Jake is trying to figure out how many grapes he can get from a certain vineyard. 

- The vineyard can usually produce 19/2 baskets of grapes every season. However, due to weather conditions, only 19/29 of the usual amount were produced this season. How many baskets of grapes were produced this season?

- But Jake isn't the only one interested in these grapes. He has to share the grapes with others. He gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes. How many baskets of grapes does he get?

- Out of the grapes that he got, Jake wants to make some grape juice. But he only uses 9/10 of his grapes to make the juice. How many baskets of grapes does he use for the juice?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculating the number of baskets of grapes produced this season:
   - The vineyard can usually produce 19/2 baskets of grapes every season.
   - However, due to weather conditions, only 19/29 of the usual amount were produced this season.
   - So, the number of baskets produced this season = (19/2) * (19/29) = 19/3 baskets.

### Answer: 19/3 baskets

2. Calculating the number of baskets of grapes Jake gets:
   - Jake gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes.
   - So, the number of baskets of grapes Jake gets = (19/3) * (7/11) = 133/99 baskets.

### Answer: 133/99 baskets

3. Calculating the number of baskets of grapes Jake uses for the grape juice:
   - Jake uses 9/10 of his grapes to make the juice.
   - So, the number of baskets of grapes Jake uses for the juice = (133/99) * (9/10) = 1197/990 baskets.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. The larger snowball at the bottom has a diameter of 17/8 feet.
   * The radius of the larger snowball is 17/16 feet.
   * The volume of the larger snowball is (4/3) * π * (17/16)^3 = 2.2 cubic feet.

2. The smaller snowball on top has a diameter of 1/20 feet.
   * The radius of the smaller snowball is 1/40 feet.

1. The lion ate 28/26 of a zebra in one day.
2. The lion ate 23/9 of a wildebeest the next day.
3. To find how much less of the zebra the lion ate compared to the wildebeest, we need to subtract the amount of zebra from the amount of wildebeest.

The amount of zebra eaten:
* 28/26 of a zebra

The amount of wildebeest eaten:
* 23/9 of a wildebeest

To find the difference, we subtract:
* 23/9 - 28/26 = (23*26 - 28*9) / (9*26)

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The robot starts with 25/10 units of energy.
2) It then uses 27/23 units of energy to complete a series of complex computations.
3) To calculate the remaining energy, we need to subtract the amount of energy used from the initial amount of energy.

Subtracting the energy used:
25/10 - 27/23 = (25 * 23 - 27 * 10) / (10 * 23)
= (575 - 270) / 230
= 305 / 230
= 1.326 units of energy remaining.

        During rainy weather, a small snail moves at a snail-pace covering 17/21 of a meter in an hour. Another slightly faster snail covers 20/24 of a meter in the same time during such weather. 

One rainy day, the first snail started an hour earlier than the second. At the time when the second snail began, a third snail that covers 18/17 of a meter per hour also started moving. 

What is their total distance in meters 1 hour after all three have started moving? Compute the result using the operation ((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) for the first two snails' distance, and multiply this result by (18 / 17) for the total distance , including the third snail.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first snail covers 17/21 of a meter in an hour.
2. The second snail covers 20/24 of a meter in an hour.
3. The first snail started 1 hour earlier than the second snail.
4. The third snail covers 18/17 of a meter per hour.
5. We need to find the total distance covered by all three snails 1 hour after the third snail started moving.

Step 1: Calculate the distance covered by the first two snails in 1 hour.
Distance covered by first snail = 17/21 meters
Distance covered by second snail = 20/24 meters
Total distance covered by first two snails = (17/21) + (20/24) meters

Step 2: Multiply the total distance covered by the first two snails by the distance covered by the third snail per hour.
Total distance = ((17/21) + (20/24)) * (18/17) meters

Simplifying the calculation:
Total distance = ((17/21) + (20/24)) * (18/17)
            = ((17/21) + (5/6)) * (18/17)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* In the morning, the cat eats 16/12 of a can of cat food
* In the evening, the cat eats 6/10 of a can of cat food
* To find the total amount the cat eats in one day, we need to add the morning and evening amounts together

First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator:
* 16/12 = 40/30
* 6/10 = 18/30

Now we can add the amounts:
* 40/30 + 18/30 = 58/30

To simplify this, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 2:

Now we can add the amounts:

Let's start with the first step. You add 7/15 of a new set to your current collection.

Next, your friend gifts you 9 more sets. So now you have the original collection, plus 7/15 of a new set, plus 9 more sets.

Finally, you can only fit 26/27 of the total in your display case.

To find the total number of sets, we need to add the original 7/15 of a set and the 9 sets gifted by your friend:
7/15 + 9 = 135/15 + 135/15 = 270/15 sets

Now, we know that you can only fit 26/27 of the total in your display case. To find the number of sets that can fit, we multiply the total number of sets by 26/27:

        Turtle Tilly is collecting food for the winter. She has gathered 25/9 kg of sea plants, and she then finds 8/13 kg more. In a close-by rock, she spots another food stash weighing 24/27 kg. After gobbling up these finds, Tilly stumbles upon yet another food source weighing 21/26 kg. If Tilly combines all her found food, how many kilograms does she now have in total? Answer as a simplified fraction.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Tilly has gathered 25/9 kg of sea plants.
2. She then finds 8/13 kg more.
3. She finds another food stash weighing 24/27 kg.
4. She then finds another food source weighing 21/26 kg.

To find the total amount of food Tilly has, we need to add up all these fractions:

25/9 + 8/13 + 24/27 + 21/26

To add fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of all the denominators.
The LCD of 9, 13, 27, and 26 is 702.

Now we can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 702:
25/9 = 175/702
8/13 = 432/702 
24/27 = 624/702
21/26 = 546/702

Adding these up:
175/702 + 432/702 + 624/702 + 546/702 = 1777/702

Therefore, the total amount of food Tilly has is 1777/702 kg.

        Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements. 

What does Captain Alf’s final calculation come to? Use these steps and corresponding fractions to find your answer.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate the distance to the nearby island.
Distance to the island = 17/2 nautical miles
Captain Alf's current location = 4/2 nautical miles away from the island
Difference in location = 17/2 - 4/2 = 13/2 nautical miles

Step 2: Adjust for the tide pushing the boat off course.
Tide adjustment = 14/9 nautical miles
Adjusted distance = 13/2 + 14/9 = (117/18 + 14/9) = 131/18 nautical miles

Step 3: Calculate the fuel requirements based on the boat's fuel efficiency.
Fuel efficiency = 22/15 nautical miles per gallon
Fuel required = 131/18 ÷ (22/15) = (131/18) * (15/22) = 1905/396 gallons

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Arthur practices piano for 20/21 of an hour every day during the week.
* On weekends, he practices an additional 11/29 of an hour per day.

To find the total time he spends practicing on the weekend, we need to add the two amounts together:
* 20/21 of an hour + 11/29 of an hour

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 21 and 29 is 609.
* 20/21 of an hour = 290/609 of an hour
* 11/29 of an hour = 209/609 of an hour

Now we can add them together:
* 290/609 of an hour + 209/609 of an hour = 499/609 of an hour

Therefore, Arthur spends 499/609 of an hour practicing the piano each day on the weekend.

Last month's sales to production ratio:
* Callie sold 20 pens for every 15 she produced
* She also sold an additional 16 pens for every 22 she put out for sale
* So the total ratio is (20/15) + (16/22) = (4/3) + (16/22) = (4/3) + (8/11) = (44/33)

This week's ratio of interested customers to production:

4. Jack rented a scooter and rode it for 7/17 of an hour.

5. To find the total hours they both rode scooters, we add Josh's hours and Jack's hours:
   18.083 hours + 7/17 hours = 18.083 + 0.412 = 18.495 hours

6. To simplify the fraction, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions.
   The LCD of 1 and 17 is 17.

7. Rewriting the mixed number 18.495 as an improper fraction:
   18.495 = (18 * 17 + 8.495 * 17) / 17 = 306 + 144 / 17 = 450 / 17

   - 23/28 of the lamps are table lamps
   - 8/19 of the lamps are decorative lamps

2. To find the total fraction of the inventory these lamps constitute, we need to add up the fractions.

3. Adding the fractions:

4. To add fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD). The LCD of 26, 11, 28, and 19 is 2,926.

5. Converting the fractions to have the LCD of 2,926:
   - 4/26 = 308/2,926
   - 15/11 = 2,430/2,926
   - 23/28 = 2,346/2,926

        In a snow fight, Mike threw 9/19 of his snowballs and his friend, John threw 6/8 of his snowballs. After a while, Mike found 4 more snowballs to throw.

The question is, if 'u' represents the number of snowballs thrown by both Mike and John and 'j' is the total number of snowballs Mike had after finding more, how many snowballs did Mike have in total?

Solve the following equations to find the variable 'j':

u = 9/19 + 6/8

j = u + 4/1

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Step 1: Find the total number of snowballs thrown by Mike and John.
u = 9/19 + 6/8
u = (9/19) + (6/8)
u = (9 × 8) / (19 × 8) + (6 × 19) / (8 × 19)
u = 72/152 + 114/152
u = 186/152

Step 2: Find the total number of snowballs Mike had after finding more.
j = u + 4/1
j = 186/152 + 4

        Debra is baking cookies and she realizes she has two different recipes for the same type of cookie. She's wondering if she combines the ingredients from both, if she will end up with even more cookies or not. 

The first recipe requires (27 / 3) cups flour and (11 / 7) cups sugar. She determines the ratio of flour to sugar by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar. She then subtracts (21 / 26) from this ratio because that's how many cups of sugar her friend says makes the cookies too sweet. After that, she adds (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio to see how many total cups of flour she will need. How many cups of flour will she have in the end?

Given information:
- The distance flown for the first exercise is 24/14 miles.
- The distance flown for the second exercise is also 24/14 miles.

Step 1: Find the value of 'w'.
Since the distance flown for each exercise is the same, we can say that w = 24/14 miles.

Step 2: Find the value of 't'.
The total distance flown for both exercises is the product of 'w' times 'w'.

1. During the first refuel, the UFO filled 20/16 of its fuel tank.

2. At the second fuel stop, the UFO filled another 24/25 of its tank.

To calculate the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill, we need to add the two fractions together.

First, we need to convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 16 and 25 is 400.

20/16 = 25/20 = 500/400
24/25 = 384/400

Now we can add the fractions:
500/400 + 384/400 = 884/400

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 4:
884/400 = 221/100

Therefore, the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops is 221/100.

2. The second fraction is the zooming potential, which is 30 out of 26.
3. Professor Astro calculates the sum of these two fractions: (24/27) + (30/26)

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator is 702 (27 x 26).

So, we convert the fractions to have a common denominator of 702:
(24/27) = (224/702)
(30/26) = (810/702)

Now we can add the fractions:
(224/702) + (810/702) = 1034/702

Simplifying the fraction, we get:
1034/702 = 1.47
