        Compute all the factor pairs of the number 59.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find all the factor pairs of a number, we need to find all the numbers that can divide the given number evenly.

To find the factor pairs of 59, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with 1 as the first factor.
2. Divide 59 by the first factor to get the second factor.
3. Check if the second factor is a whole number. If it is, then the pair (first factor, second factor) is a factor pair.
4. Repeat the process, incrementing the first factor by 1 until the first factor is greater than the square root of 59.

Let's apply this process to find the factor pairs of 59:

1. First factor = 1
   Second factor = 59 / 1 = 59
   This is a factor pair: (1, 59)

2. First factor = 2
   Second factor = 59 / 2 = 29.5
   This is not a factor pair because 29.5 is not a whole number.

3. First factor = 3
   Second factor = 59 / 3 = 19.67
   This is not a factor pair because 19.67 is not a whole number.

4. First factor = 4
   Second factor = 59 / 4 = 14.75
   This is not a factor pair because 14.75 is not a whole number.

5. First factor = 5
   Second factor = 59 / 5 = 11.8
   This is not a factor pair because 11.8 is not a whole number.

6. First factor = 6
   Second factor = 59 / 6 = 9.83
   This is not a factor pair because 9.83 is not a whole number.

7. First factor = 7
   Second factor = 59 / 7 = 8.43
   This is not a factor pair because 8.43 is not a whole number.

8. First factor = 8
   Second factor = 59 / 8 = 7.38
   This is not a factor pair because 7.38 is not a whole number.

9. First factor = 9
   Second factor = 59 / 9 = 6.56
   This is not a factor pair because 6.56 is not a whole number.

10. First factor = 10
    Second factor = 59 / 10 = 5.9
    This is not a factor pair because 5.9 is not a whole number.

The only factor pair of 59 is (1, 59).
