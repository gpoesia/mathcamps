        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        In their game, Kyle threw a ball for a distance of 18/4 yards, while Lisa threw the same ball for a distance of 19/9 yards. How many yards did the ball travel in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance the ball traveled, we need to add the distances Kyle and Lisa threw the ball. 

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 18/4 and 19/9. The least common multiple of 4 and 9 is 36. 

* Convert 18/4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 36:  (18/4) * (9/9) = 162/36
* Convert 19/9 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 36: (19/9) * (4/4) = 76/36

Now we can add the fractions: 162/36 + 76/36 = 238/36

Simplify the fraction: 238/36 = 59.5/9

Therefore, the ball traveled a total of 59.5/9 yards.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.  The smallest common denominator for 7 and 14 is 14.  We can rewrite 18/7 as 36/14. Now we can add the fractions: 36/14 + 12/14 = 48/14. This can be simplified to 24/7.

        The bottom of a door measures 4/19 inches from the floor, and the top of the door measures 9/10 inches from the ceiling. What is the total distance of the bottom and top of the door from the floor and ceiling, respectively?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance, we need to add the distance from the floor to the bottom of the door and the distance from the ceiling to the top of the door. 
We add 4/19 + 9/10.
To add fractions, we need to have a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 19 and 10 is 190.
So, we have 4/19 = 40/190 and 9/10 = 171/190.
Now, we can add: 40/190 + 171/190 = 211/190.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know the total distance for one door is 211/190 inches.  Since both doors have the same measurements, we simply need to double this distance.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We need to add the distance from the floor to the bottom of the door and the distance from the ceiling to the top of the door.
So we are adding 4/16 + 9/10.
To add fractions, we need to have a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 16 and 10 is 80.
So, we have 4/16 = 20/80 and 9/10 = 72/80.
Now, we can add: 20/80 + 72/80 = 92/80.

        Ralph's juice recipe requires 17/3 liters of apple juice. However, he only uses 15/11 liters of it. How many liters of apple juice are left unused?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how much apple juice is left unused, we need to subtract the amount used from the total amount needed. 

We have: 17/3 - 15/11

To subtract fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common denominator of 3 and 11 is 33. 

17/3 * 11/11 = 187/33
15/11 * 3/3 = 45/33

Now, we can subtract: 187/33 - 45/33 = 142/33

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know Ralph had 142/33 liters of apple juice left unused. Now, he adds 3/18 liters. To find the new amount of unused juice, we subtract the added amount from the previous amount:

142/33 - 3/18

To subtract fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common denominator of 33 and 18 is 198.

142/33 * 6/6 = 852/198
3/18 * 11/11 = 33/198

Now, we can subtract: 852/198 - 33/198 = 819/198

        A rocket was launched into orbit. On the first day, it traveled 15/3 light years. On the second day, it traveled an additional 2/7 light years. How far has the rocket traveled in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the distance traveled on the first day to the distance traveled on the second day.

* Distance traveled on the first day: 15/3 light years
* Distance traveled on the second day: 2/7 light years

To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 3 and 7 is 21.

* 15/3 = (15 * 7) / (3 * 7) = 105/21
* 2/7 = (2 * 3) / (7 * 3) = 6/21

Now we can add the fractions:

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 3 and 7 is 21.

* 15/3 = (15 * 7) / (3 * 7) = 105/21
* 18/7 = (18 * 3) / (7 * 3) = 54/21

Now we can add the fractions:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total portion of the treasure map Captain Silverbeard found, we need to add the fractions he found at each site: 10/13 + 16/19. 

However, we can't add fractions with different denominators.  We need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 19 is 247. 

* To get a denominator of 247 for 10/13, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 19: (10 * 19) / (13 * 19) = 190/247.
* To get a denominator of 247 for 16/19, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 13: (16 * 13) / (19 * 13) = 208/247.

Now we can add the fractions: 190/247 + 208/247 = (190+208)/247 = 398/247.

Since the numerator is larger than the denominator, this is an improper fraction. We can convert it to a mixed number: 398/247 = 1 and 151/247.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the portion of the map Captain Silverbeard found on the third site (15/17) to the total portion he already had (1 and 151/247).  

First, let's convert the mixed number to an improper fraction: 1 and 151/247 = (1 * 247 + 151) / 247 = 398/247.

Now we need a common denominator for 398/247 and 15/17. The least common multiple of 247 and 17 is 4199.

* To get a denominator of 4199 for 398/247, multiply both numerator and denominator by 17: (398 * 17) / (247 * 17) = 6766/4199
* To get a denominator of 4199 for 15/17, multiply both numerator and denominator by 247: (15 * 247) / (17 * 247) = 3705/4199

Now we can add the fractions: 6766/4199 + 3705/4199 = (6766 + 3705) / 4199 = 10471/4199

This is an improper fraction. Let's convert it to a mixed number: 10471/4199 = 2 and 1073/4199.

        Suppose instead of finding 10/13 of the treasure map at the first shipwreck site, Captain Silverbeard found a larger piece which was 10/9 of the total map.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Captain Silverbeard found 10/9 of the map at the first site and 16/19 at the second site. To find the total portion, we need to add these fractions: 10/9 + 16/19.

We need to find a common denominator for 9 and 19. The least common multiple is 171.

* To get a denominator of 171 for 10/9, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 19: (10 * 19) / (9 * 19) = 190/171.
* To get a denominator of 171 for 16/19, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 9: (16 * 9) / (19 * 9) = 144/171.

Now we can add the fractions: 190/171 + 144/171 = (190 + 144)/171 = 334/171.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        A hiker decides to walk 9/6 miles North before walking 2/16 miles East. How many miles has the hiker traveled in total?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The hiker walks 9/6 miles North and then 2/16 miles East.  To find the total distance traveled, we need to add these distances.  However, we need to make sure that we are adding fractions with the same denominator.  
 
 The fraction 9/6 can be simplified to 3/2.  This can then be converted into an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 16 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 8.  (3/2) * (8/8) = 24/16. 
 
 Now that both fractions have a common denominator, we can add them together. 
 
 (24/16) + (2/16) = 26/16. 
 
 This fraction can be simplified to 13/8. 
 
 The hiker has traveled a total of 13/8 miles.

        In continuation to the previous question, after walking 9/6 miles North and 2/16 miles East, the hiker then decides to continue his journey and walks an additional 8/14 miles South. How many miles has the hiker now traveled in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know from the previous problem that the hiker has already traveled 13/8 miles.  Now, he walks an additional 8/14 miles South.  We can find the total distance traveled by adding this distance to the distance already traveled.  But first, we need to make sure the fractions have the same denominator. 

The fraction 8/14 can be simplified to 4/7.  We can then convert this fraction into an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 56 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 8.  (4/7)*(8/8) = 32/56.  

We can convert 13/8 into an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 56 by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 7.  (13/8)*(7/7) = 91/56.  

Now that we have equivalent fractions with a common denominator, we can add them.  

91/56 + 32/56 = 123/56.  

The hiker has now traveled a total of 123/56 miles.

        In opinion to the previous case, imagine if the hiker had initially decided to walk 10/6 miles North instead of 9/6 miles, while keeping the distance walked East unchanged at 2/16 miles. How many miles would the hiker have then traveled in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  The hiker walks 10/6 miles North and then 2/16 miles East.  To find the total distance traveled, we need to add these distances.  However, we need to make sure that we are adding fractions with the same denominator.  
 
 The fraction 10/6 can be simplified to 5/3.  This can then be converted into an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 16 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by (16/3).  (5/3) * (16/3) = 80/9. 
 
 Now that both fractions have a common denominator, we can add them together. 
 
 (80/9) + (2/16) = 1282/144. 
 
 The hiker has traveled a total of 1282/144 miles.

        In Jessica's sandbox, she has a pile of sand that is 16/9 cubic feet. She then removes 4/13 cubic feet of sand from the sandbox. How much sand does she have left in her sandbox?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how much sand Jessica has left, we need to subtract the amount of sand she removed from the original amount.  

We need a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The least common multiple of 9 and 13 is 117.

*  16/9 is equivalent to (16*13)/(9*13) = 208/117
*  4/13 is equivalent to (4*9)/(13*9) = 36/117

Now we can subtract: 208/117 - 36/117 = (208-36)/117 = 172/117

Jessica has 172/117 cubic feet of sand left in her sandbox.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the amount of sand Jessica added to the amount she had left.  

We already know she had 172/117 cubic feet of sand left. To add this to 19/15, we need a common denominator.  The least common multiple of 117 and 15 is 585.

* 172/117 is equivalent to (172*5)/(117*5) = 860/585
* 19/15 is equivalent to (19*39)/(15*39) = 741/585

Now we can add: 860/585 + 741/585 = (860+741)/585 = 1601/585

Jessica has 1601/585 cubic feet of sand in her sandbox.

        In our previous scenario, let's say that Jessica initially had a smaller pile of sand that was 16/9 cubic feet. If she still removed 4/8 cubic feet of sand as before, how much sand does she now have left in her sandbox?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to subtract the amount of sand Jessica removed from the original amount. 

First, we need to find a common denominator for 9 and 8. The least common multiple of 9 and 8 is 72.

* 16/9 is equivalent to (16*8)/(9*8) = 128/72
* 4/8 is equivalent to (4*9)/(8*9) = 36/72

Now we can subtract: 128/72 - 36/72 = (128-36)/72 = 92/72

Jessica has 92/72 cubic feet of sand left in her sandbox.

        Suppose after revisiting the route, Jack realizes the distance from his home to the library is actually 3/9 of a mile instead of 5/9. The distance from the library to his grandparents' house still remains 17/20 of a mile. How many miles does Jack ride his scooter in total then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  The distance to the library is 3/9 of a mile, which simplifies to 1/3 of a mile. We need to find a common denominator for 1/3 and 17/20. The least common multiple of 3 and 20 is 60. 

* 1/3 * 20/20 = 20/60
* 17/20 * 3/3 = 51/60

Now we can add the fractions: 20/60 + 51/60 = 71/60 miles.

**Twigs:**

* Each twig burns for 1/12 of an hour.

        If a ring maker uses 12/16 ounces of a silver for the base of the ring and 16/2 ounces to make the rest of the ring, how many ounces of silver did the ring maker use in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, simplify the fractions. 12/16 ounces of silver for the base is equal to 3/4 ounces.
16/2 ounces for the rest of the ring is equal to 8 ounces.
The ring maker used a total of 3/4 + 8 ounces of silver.
To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 4 and 1 is 4. So, we rewrite 8 as 32/4.
Now, we can add the fractions: 3/4 + 32/4 = 35/4.
Converting 35/4 to a mixed number, we get 8 3/4 ounces.

### Answer: 8 3/4

        The ring maker decides to add an ornamental filigree to the ring, which requires an additional 18/20 ounces of silver. How many total ounces of silver did the ring maker use including the filigree?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know the ring maker used 8 3/4 ounces of silver for the ring. We need to add the 18/20 ounces of silver used for the filigree.
First, let's simplify 18/20. Both the numerator and denominator are divisible by 2, giving us 9/10.
Now we need to add 8 3/4 and 9/10. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 4 and 10 is 20. 
Let's convert 8 3/4 to an improper fraction: 8 * 4 + 3 = 35, so 8 3/4 is equal to 35/4. Now we can convert 35/4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 20: 35/4 * 5/5 = 175/20.
Finally, we can add the fractions: 175/20 + 9/10 = 175/20 + 18/20 = 193/20. 
Converting 193/20 to a mixed number, we get 9 13/20 ounces.

        If initially, the ring maker used 10/16 ounces of a silver for the base of the ring instead of 12/16 ounces, while still using 16/2 ounces to make the rest of the ring, how many total ounces of silver did the ring maker use then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  First, simplify the fraction 10/16 to 5/8 ounces of silver for the base.
The rest of the ring still uses 16/2 = 8 ounces of silver.
So, the ring maker used a total of 5/8 + 8 ounces of silver.
To add fractions, we need a common denominator.  The common denominator of 8 and 1 is 8.  So, we rewrite 8 as 64/8.
Now, we can add the fractions: 5/8 + 64/8 = 69/8
Converting 69/8 to a mixed number, we get 8 5/8 ounces.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total number of bushels, we need to add the morning and afternoon amounts.  Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can simply add the numerators: 10/11 + 17/11 = (10+17)/11 = 27/11.

This means the tree produced a total of 27/11 bushels of apples.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the amount produced in the morning (10/9 bushels) to the amount produced in the afternoon (17/11 bushels).  To do this, we need a common denominator.

The least common multiple of 9 and 11 is 99.  We can rewrite the fractions:

* 10/9 = (10 * 11)/(9 * 11) = 110/99
* 17/11 = (17 * 9)/(11 * 9) = 153/99

Now we can add: 110/99 + 153/99 = (110 + 153)/99 = 263/99

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the combined range increase, we need to add the increase from Sam's binoculars to the increase from Joe's binoculars. 

We need a common denominator to add the fractions:

* Sam's increase: 3/14 mile
* Joe's increase: 16/16 mile (which is the same as 1 mile)

To get a common denominator of 14, we multiply the numerator and denominator of 16/16 by 14/14: 

* Joe's increase: (16/16) * (14/14) = 224/224 mile

Now we can add the fractions:

* 3/14 + 224/224 = 3/14 + 224/14 = 227/14

Therefore, the combined range increase is 227/14 miles.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We're given that the painter initially used 18/11 liters of blue paint and now uses 1/7 liters of white paint.  To find the total amount of paint used, we simply need to add these two quantities:

18/11 + 1/7

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 11 and 7 is 77.

* Convert 18/11 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 77: (18/11) * (7/7) = 126/77

* Convert 1/7 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 77: (1/7) * (11/11) = 11/77

Now we can add the fractions: 126/77 + 11/77 = 137/77

Therefore, the painter would have used a total of 137/77 liters of paint.

        After feeding the monkeys and giraffes, Mary then feeds the elephants 19/11 pounds of food. How many pounds of food in total has she given to the monkeys, giraffes, and elephants at the zoo?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know Mary fed the monkeys and giraffes a total of 3/2 pounds of food.
To find the total amount of food she fed all three animals, we add the amount she fed the elephants to the amount she fed the monkeys and giraffes: 3/2 + 19/11. 
To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 11 is 22.
3/2 is equivalent to (3*11)/(2*11) = 33/22. 
19/11 is equivalent to (19*2)/(11*2) = 38/22
Now we can add the fractions: 33/22 + 38/22 = 71/22.

        Originally, Mary had given the monkeys 6/20 pounds of food and the giraffes 18/15 pounds of food. But what if she had made a mistake, and she actually gave the giraffes 18/19 pounds of food instead? How many pounds of food in total did she then give to the monkeys and giraffes?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We need to add the amount of food given to the monkeys and the amount given to the giraffes. The amount given to the monkeys is 6/20 pounds. The amount given to the giraffes is now 18/19 pounds. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.  The least common multiple of 20 and 19 is 380.

6/20 is equivalent to (6*19)/(20*19) = 114/380
18/19 is equivalent to (18*20)/(19*20) = 360/380

Adding the two fractions, we get 114/380 + 360/380 = 474/380.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We need to add the two amounts of gold together. Since the fractions have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 8 and 5 is 40.

* 11/8 = (11 * 5) / (8 * 5) = 55/40
* 5/5 = (5 * 8) / (5 * 8) = 40/40

Now we can add the fractions:

* 55/40 + 40/40 = 95/40

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

* 95/40 = 2 15/40 = 2 3/8

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the new gold (7/11 ounces) to the amount Captain Hook already had (2 3/8 ounces). First, let's convert the mixed number into an improper fraction:

* 2 3/8 = (2 * 8 + 3) / 8 = 19/8

Now we need to find a common denominator for 8 and 11, which is 88.

* 19/8 = (19 * 11) / (8 * 11) = 209/88
* 7/11 = (7 * 8) / (11 * 8) = 56/88

Now we can add the fractions:

* 209/88 + 56/88 = 265/88

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

* 265/88 = 3 1/88

Therefore, Captain Hook now has a total of 3 1/88 ounces of gold.

        In the previous treasure hunt, Captain Hook had originally found 11/8 ounces of gold. But let's say, instead of finding 5/5 ounces of gold as he did in his latest treasure hunt, he discovered 7/5 ounces of gold. How much total weight of gold would Captain Hook have had then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We need to add the two amounts of gold together.  Since the fractions have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator.  The least common denominator for 8 and 5 is 40.

* 11/8 = (11 * 5) / (8 * 5) = 55/40
* 7/5 = (7 * 8) / (5 * 8) = 56/40

Now we can add the fractions:

* 55/40 + 56/40 = 111/40

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

* 111/40 = 2 31/40

Therefore, Captain Hook would have had a total of 2 31/40 ounces of gold.

        If Jake originally had 9/10 of a dollar and then received an additional 20/15 of a dollar, how much money does he have in his wallet now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We first need to simplify 20/15 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 5. This gives us 20/15 = 4/3.

Now, we need to add 9/10 and 4/3.  To do this, we need a common denominator.  The least common denominator of 10 and 3 is 30.

*  9/10 * 3/3 = 27/30
*  4/3 * 10/10 = 40/30

Now we can add: 27/30 + 40/30 = 67/30

Finally, we simplify the fraction and convert it to dollars: 67/30 = 2 7/30 = $2.23

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the combined height, we need to add the heights of the front and back portions of the chair.  First, let's simplify 20/14 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2: 20/14 = 10/7. Now, we need to add 5/2 and 10/7. To do this, we need a common denominator.  The least common denominator of 2 and 7 is 14. So, we rewrite 5/2 as (5 * 7)/(2 * 7) = 35/14. Now we can add: 35/14 + 10/7 = 35/14 + 20/14 = 55/14.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Simplify the fraction:** 12/9 simplifies to 4/3. This means John donated more than his total shirts. It's impossible to donate more than you have.
* **Assume a mistake:** It's likely there's a mistake in the problem. Let's assume the problem meant to say John donated 2/9 of his shirts. 
* **Calculate the donated shirts:**  2/9 * 5 shirts = 10/9 shirts. Since you can't have a fraction of a shirt, we'll round down to 1 shirt donated. 
* **Calculate remaining shirts:** John has 5 - 1 = 4 shirts left.

        Bob has a jacket that measures 14/3 meters in length. However, he finds the jacket is slightly too long for him so he decides to cut off 14/16 meter from the original length. What is the length of Bob's jacket after the alteration?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the length of the jacket after the alteration, we need to subtract the length Bob cuts off from the original length.

Original length: 14/3 meters
Length cut off: 14/16 meters

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 3 and 16 is 48.

* (14/3) * (16/16) = 224/48
* (14/16) * (3/3) = 42/48

Now we can subtract the lengths: 224/48 - 42/48 = 182/48

Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

182/48 = (182/2)/(48/2) = 91/24

Therefore, the length of Bob's jacket after the alteration is 91/24 meters.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to subtract the additional length Bob cuts off from the length of the jacket after the first alteration.

Length after first alteration: 91/24 meters
Length cut off in the second alteration: 9/4 meters

We need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 24 and 4 is 24.

* (9/4) * (6/6) = 54/24

Now we can subtract the lengths: 91/24 - 54/24 = 37/24

Therefore, the length of Bob's jacket after the second alteration is 37/24 meters.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We follow the same steps as before, but with the new original length.

Original length: 16/3 meters
Length cut off: 14/16 meters

Find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 3 and 16 is 48.

* (16/3) * (16/16) = 256/48
* (14/16) * (3/3) = 42/48

Now subtract the lengths: 256/48 - 42/48 = 214/48

Simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

214/48 = (214/2)/(48/2) = 107/24

Therefore, the length of Bob's jacket after the alteration is 107/24 meters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common denominator of 12 and 8 is 24.
10/12 = (10*2)/(12*2) = 20/24
3/8 = (3*3)/(8*3) = 9/24
Therefore, John watched for a total of 20/24 + 9/24 = 29/24 hours.

To add fractions, they need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 10 and 13 is 130. 

* 5/10 hours = (5 * 13) / (10 * 13) = 65/130 hours

Total time: 65/130 + 100/130 = 165/130 hours

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 5.

        Let's reconsider our previous journey of the rocket. Assume that instead of traveling 8/2 light-years towards a distant star after reaching the alien planet, the rocket only traveled 8/13 light-years. In this case, what would be the total distance covered by the rocket?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The rocket traveled 11/18 light-years to the alien planet and then 8/13 light-years to the star. To find the total distance, we need to add these two fractions. 

However, they have different denominators, so we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 13 is 234.

* We convert 11/18 to a fraction with a denominator of 234: (11*13)/(18*13) = 143/234
* We convert 8/13 to a fraction with a denominator of 234: (8*18)/(13*18) = 144/234

Now we can add the fractions: 143/234 + 144/234 = (143+144)/234 = 287/234

        Johnathan needs 12/14 yards of one fabric to make a sleeping bag, and another 8/5 yards of a different fabric to create the liner. How many yards of fabric does he need in total to create his sleeping bag?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they must have the same denominator. The least common denominator of 14 and 5 is 70. 
* (12/14) * (5/5) = 60/70
* (8/5) * (14/14) = 112/70
Now that they have the same denominator, we can add them together: 60/70 + 112/70 = 172/70. 
This improper fraction can be simplified to a mixed number: 172/70 = 2 32/70. 
The fraction 32/70 can be simplified to 16/35.
Therefore, Johnathan needs 2 16/35 yards of fabric to make his sleeping bag.

        After calculating the total fabrics Jonathan needed for the sleeping bag, he remembered that he had bought 17 yards of fabric in total.  
How many yards does he have left after using the necessary fabric to create his sleeping bag?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to subtract the fabric needed for the sleeping bag (2 16/35 yards) from the total fabric Johnathan bought (17 yards). 

First, let's convert 17 yards to a mixed number with the same denominator as 2 16/35.  17 yards is the same as 17 0/35.

Now we can subtract: 
17 0/35 - 2 16/35 

Since we can't subtract 16/35 from 0/35, we borrow 1 from the whole number 17, leaving us with 16.  We then convert the 1 we borrowed into 35/35 (to match the denominator).

This gives us: 
16 35/35 - 2 16/35 

Now we can subtract the whole numbers and the fractions separately:

16 - 2 = 14
35/35 - 16/35 = 19/35

Therefore, Johnathan has 14 19/35 yards of fabric left.

        In the previous problem, Johnathan originally thought he needed 12/14 yards of one fabric to create the sleeping bag. But after rechecking his measurements, he realized he only needed 12/17 yards of that fabric. The liner fabric remained the same at 8/5 yards. How many total yards of fabric does he actually need to make the sleeping bag?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The least common denominator of 17 and 5 is 85.  Let's adjust our fractions to have the same denominator:
* (12/17) * (5/5) = 60/85
* (8/5) * (17/17) = 136/85

Now we can add the fractions together: 60/85 + 136/85 = 196/85. 

This improper fraction simplifies to a mixed number: 196/85 = 2 16/85. 

Therefore, Johnathan actually needs 2 16/85 yards of fabric for his sleeping bag.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total acreage, we need to add the acreage of pine trees and oak trees.

* **Pine trees:** 5/4 acres

* **Pine trees:** (5/4) * (1/1) = 5/4 acres

* **Pine trees:** (5/3) * (2/2) = 10/6 acres

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to subtract the amount used for roses (17/20 kg) from the total amount Miss Daisy had (14/6 kg). 

First, let's find a common denominator for 6 and 20. The least common multiple of 6 and 20 is 60.

Converting 14/6 to have a denominator of 60: (14/6) * (10/10) = 140/60

Converting 17/20 to have a denominator of 60: (17/20) * (3/3) = 51/60

Now, we can subtract the fractions: (140/60) - (51/60) = 89/60

However, this result is an improper fraction, meaning the numerator is larger than the denominator. We can convert it to a mixed number: 89/60 = 1 29/60.

Since we're dealing with fertilizer, we'll only use the fraction part of the result.

Therefore, Miss Daisy has 29/60 kg of fertilizer left to use on her other flowers.

        Scientists have discovered that the moon is slowly moving away from Earth. If the distance increases by 4/16 meters every year, and unexpectedly there was an additional increase of 20/6 meters this year, what is the total change in distance this year?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the regular increase of 4/16 meters to the unexpected increase of 20/6 meters.

First, let's simplify the fractions:
* 4/16 = 1/4 meters
* 20/6 = 10/3 meters

Now, to add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 4 and 3 is 12.

* (1/4) * (3/3) = 3/12 meters
* (10/3) * (4/4) = 40/12 meters

Now we can add the fractions:
* 3/12 + 40/12 = 43/12 meters

Therefore, the total change in distance this year is 43/12 meters.

        Building upon the previous scenario, if scientists predict an additional increase of 16/6 meters in the coming year, what will be the total expected change in distance from Earth to the moon after this increase?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We need to add the total change this year (43/12 meters) to the predicted change in the coming year (16/6 meters).

First, let's simplify the fraction for the predicted change: 16/6 = 8/3 meters.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.  The least common denominator for 12 and 3 is 12.

* (43/12) remains the same.
* (8/3) * (4/4) = 32/12 meters

Now we can add the fractions:
* 43/12 + 32/12 = 75/12 meters

Therefore, the total expected change in distance from Earth to the moon after the additional increase will be 75/12 meters.

        Continuing from the previous scenario, suppose scientists later realized that there was a calculation error. Instead of an unexpected increase of 20/6 meters in the moon's distance this year, they found the increase was actually 20/18 meters. Given this corrected value, what is the total change in distance from the Earth to the moon this year?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find the total change in distance, which is the regular increase of 4/16 meters plus the corrected unexpected increase of 20/18 meters.

First, let's simplify the fractions:
* 4/16 = 1/4 meters
* 20/18 = 10/9 meters

Now, to add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 4 and 9 is 36.

* (1/4) * (9/9) = 9/36 meters
* (10/9) * (4/4) = 40/36 meters

Now we can add the fractions:
* 9/36 + 40/36 = 49/36 meters

Therefore, the total change in distance this year is 49/36 meters.

The wizard used a total of 214/56 ounces of ingredients.  We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2. 

* 214/56 = (214/2) / (56/2) = 107/28

        The wizard decided to use 13/7 ounces of stardust instead of the initially intended 11/7 ounces while preparing the potion. So now, what would be the total number of ounces of ingredients used in this adjusted potion recipe?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know the wizard used 18/8 ounces of moon roots and now uses 13/7 ounces of stardust. To find the total ounces, we add these fractions. We need a common denominator, which is 56.

* 18/8 is equivalent to (18 * 7) / (8 * 7) = 126/56
* 13/7 is equivalent to (13 * 8) / (7 * 8) = 104/56

Now we can add the fractions: 126/56 + 104/56 = (126 + 104) / 56 = 230/56

The wizard used a total of 230/56 ounces of ingredients. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2.

* 230/56 = (230/2) / (56/2) = 115/28

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the amount of milk in each bottle. To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. 

The least common multiple of 18 and 8 is 72.

* We can convert 8/18 to 32/72 (multiply numerator and denominator by 4)
* We can convert 18/8 to 162/72 (multiply numerator and denominator by 9)

Now we can add the fractions: 32/72 + 162/72 = 194/72.

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2. This gives us 97/36.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the amount of milk from the third bottle (6/16) to the total amount of milk Lisa already has (97/36).

* Convert 6/16 to 54/144 (multiply numerator and denominator by 9)
* Convert 97/36 to 388/144 (multiply numerator and denominator by 4)

Now we can add the fractions: 54/144 + 388/144 = 442/144

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2. This gives us 221/72.

We can add these fractions directly if they have the same denominator.  The least common multiple of 11 and 20 is 220.

*  (13/11) * (20/20) = 260/220
* (8/20) * (11/11) = 88/220

Now we can add the fractions: 260/220 + 88/220 = 348/220

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4:

We need a common denominator to add these fractions.  The least common multiple of 55 and 10 is 110.

* **Simplify the fractions:**
    * (17/20) km is already in its simplest form.
    * (15/3) km simplifies to 5 km.

* **Visualize the journey:** Imagine a right triangle where the distance East is one leg, the distance North is the other leg, and the total distance traveled is the hypotenuse.

* **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**  The Pythagorean theorem states: a² + b² = c² 
    * a = 17/20 km (East)
    * b = 5 km (North)
    * c = total distance (what we want to find)

* **Calculate:**
    * (17/20)² + 5² = c²
    * (289/400) + 25 = c²
    * (289/400) + (10000/400) = c²

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Captain Bill traveled a total of 23/5 miles north, and then 20/17 miles south. To find the net distance, we subtract the southward travel from the northward travel: 23/5 - 20/17. To subtract fractions, they must have the same denominator. The least common denominator for 5 and 17 is 85.
We can rewrite 23/5 as (23 * 17)/(5 * 17) = 391/85.
We can rewrite 20/17 as (20 * 5)/(17 * 5) = 100/85.

To subtract fractions, they need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 68 and 9 is 612.

* (229/68) * (9/9) = 2061/612

We need a common denominator to add the fractions. The least common multiple of 17 and 4 is 68.

* (19/17) * (4/4) = 76/68 pounds of ham

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total length, we need to add the original length of the sleeping bag to the length of the extension.

The original length is 18/19 meters. 
The extension is 8/11 meters.

To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. We can find the least common multiple of 19 and 11, which is 209.

Converting 18/19 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 209:
(18/19) * (11/11) = 198/209

Converting 8/11 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 209:
(8/11) * (19/19) = 152/209

Now we can add the fractions:
198/209 + 152/209 = 350/209

Therefore, the total length of the sleeping bag is 350/209 meters.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We need to add the original length of the sleeping bag to the length of the extension.

The original length is 18/19 meters.
The extension is 8/8 meters, which simplifies to 1 meter.

To add a fraction and a whole number, we can convert the whole number to a fraction with the same denominator as the fraction.  

Converting 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 19:
1 = 19/19

Now we can add the fractions:
18/19 + 19/19 = 37/19

Therefore, the total length of the sleeping bag is 37/19 meters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to convert 16/2 into a fraction with the same denominator as 10/13, which is 13. We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 13/2:

Now we can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:

* 208/26 = (208 / 2) / (26 / 2) = 104/13

Now, we can add the two fractions to find the total amount of water Sarah added:

Next, we need to add the apples found in the refrigerator. We need a common denominator for 17/4 and 3/19.  The least common denominator is 76.
So, 17/4 is equivalent to (17*19)/(4*19) = 323/76.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the time spent fixing and polishing the watch: 12/7 + 3/15. To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 15 is 105. 
*  12/7 = (12 * 15)/(7 * 15) = 180/105
*  3/15 = (3 * 7)/(15 * 7) = 21/105
Now we can add the fractions: 180/105 + 21/105 = 201/105. 
We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3: (201/3)/(105/3) = 67/35.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Peggy initially swam 5/4 miles, and then swam back 1/15 miles.
Therefore, she is 5/4 - 1/15 miles away from her family.
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 15 is 60.
So, we have (5/4)*(15/15) - (1/15)*(4/4) = 75/60 - 4/60
This simplifies to (75-4)/60 = 71/60 miles.

        A farmer has a fields where he grows wheat. One part of the field is 4 acres and another part is 11/12 of an acre. How many acres in total does he use to grow wheat?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total acreage, we need to add the two parts of the field together. Since we are adding a whole number and a fraction, we can think of the whole number as a fraction with a denominator of 1. So, 4 acres is the same as 4/1 acres. 

Now we can add the fractions:  4/1 + 11/12.  To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. We can rewrite 4/1 as 48/12. 

Now we have: 48/12 + 11/12 = 59/12.

This fraction can be simplified to a mixed number: 4 11/12 acres.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the vegetable patch area (17/11 acres) to the total wheat field area (4 11/12 acres) we calculated earlier. 

First, let's convert the mixed number 4 11/12 to an improper fraction: (4*12 + 11)/12 = 59/12.

Now we can add the two fractions: 59/12 + 17/11. 

To add fractions, they need the same denominator. The least common multiple of 12 and 11 is 132.

So, we can rewrite the fractions: (59/12) * (11/11) = 649/132 and (17/11) * (12/12) = 204/132.

Now we can add them: 649/132 + 204/132 = 853/132.

This improper fraction can be simplified to a mixed number: 6 57/132.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The farmer initially thought he had 4 acres, but now knows that's only 4/9 of an acre. We need to add this to the 11/12 of an acre from the other part of the field. 

To add fractions, they need the same denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 12 is 36.

* Convert 4/9 to 16/36 (multiply numerator and denominator by 4)
* Convert 11/12 to 33/36 (multiply numerator and denominator by 3)

Now we can add: 16/36 + 33/36 = 49/36

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total fabric used, we need to add the red fabric and the blue fabric. First, we need to make sure the fractions have a common denominator. 

The least common multiple of 4 and 17 is 68. So we need to rewrite each fraction:

* 11/4 = (11 * 17) / (4 * 17) = 187/68
* 5/17 = (5 * 4) / (17 * 4) = 20/68

Now we can add the fractions:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know she used 207/68 yards of red and blue fabric. Now we need to add the 19/10 yards of golden fabric.  Again, we need a common denominator. 

The least common multiple of 68 and 10 is 340. So we rewrite our fractions:

* 207/68 = (207 * 5) / (68 * 5) = 1035/340
* 19/10 = (19 * 34) / (10 * 34) = 646/340

Now we can add:

* 1035/340 + 646/340 = (1035 + 646)/340 = 1681/340

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The designer used 5/5 yards of blue fabric, which is the same as 1 yard. So, we need to add the red fabric and the blue fabric:

* 11/4 yards + 1 yard 

To add these, we need to express 1 yard as a fraction with a denominator of 4:

* 1 yard = 4/4 yards

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to convert the mixed number 11/2 to a fraction. We can do this by multiplying the whole number (1) by the denominator (2) and adding the numerator (1): 1*2+1 = 3. So, 11/2 is equivalent to 3/2.

Now, we need to subtract 5/16 from 3/2. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 16 is 16. 

* 3/2 is equivalent to 24/16 (multiply numerator and denominator by 8).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total rainfall time, we need to add the duration of both rainfalls. We have 4/13 hours and 11/5 hours. To add fractions, they must have the same denominator. 

The least common multiple of 13 and 5 is 65. So, we rewrite the fractions:

* 4/13 = (4 * 5) / (13 * 5) = 20/65
* 11/5 = (11 * 13) / (5 * 13) = 143/65

        A fairy sprinkles 11/12 oz of magic dust over an enchanted field. She then sprinkles an additional 9/10 oz of dust over a grove of enchanted apple trees. What is the total amount of magic dust the fairy used?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of magic dust, we need to add the amount used for the field and the amount used for the apple trees.  

First, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 12 and 10 is 60. 

*  11/12 is equivalent to (11 * 5) / (12 * 5) = 55/60
*  9/10 is equivalent to (9 * 6) / (10 * 6) = 54/60

Now we can add the fractions:

55/60 + 54/60 = 109/60

This is an improper fraction, so we can simplify it to a mixed number:

109/60 = 1 49/60

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the total amount of dust used on the field and apple trees. As calculated previously, that's 1 49/60 oz.

Now, we need to subtract that amount from the fairy's original amount of dust:

14/3 - 1 49/60 = 14/3 - 109/60

To subtract fractions, they need a common denominator:

(14 * 20) / (3 * 20) - 109/60 = 280/60 - 109/60

Now we can subtract:

280/60 - 109/60 = 171/60

This can be simplified to a mixed number:

        In the first hour, a shark swims 3/9 miles and in the second hour height increases its speed to swim 13/5 miles. How many miles does the shark swim in total in these two hours?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance, we need to add the distance covered in each hour.

* **Hour 1:** The shark swims 3/9 miles.
* **Hour 2:** The shark swims 13/5 miles.

To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 5 is 45.

* **Hour 1:**  (3/9) * (5/5) = 15/45 miles
* **Hour 2:** (13/5) * (9/9) = 117/45 miles

Now we can add the distances:

* 15/45 + 117/45 = 132/45

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by 3:

* 132/45 = 44/15

The shark swims a total of **44/15 miles** in two hours.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We know the shark swam 44/15 miles in the first two hours. Now it swims an additional 14/9 miles in the third hour.

To find the total distance, we need to add the distances from all three hours:

* **Total distance:** (44/15) + (14/9) 

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 9 is 45.

* **Total distance:**  (44/15) * (3/3) + (14/9) * (5/5) = 132/45 + 70/45

Now we can add the fractions:

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 5 is 35.

* **Hour 1:** (3/7) * (5/5) = 15/35 miles
* **Hour 2:** (13/5) * (7/7) = 91/35 miles

Now we can add the distances:

17/17 * 12/12 = 204/204

*  (8/19) * (17/17) = 136/323

Now we can add the fractions:

* (364/323) * (20/20) = 7280/6460

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total length of the butterfly's flight, we need to add the lengths of the two segments.  However, we can't add fractions with different denominators.  

First, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of 19 and 17. The LCM of 19 and 17 is 323. 

Now, we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 323:

* 18/19 * (17/17) = 306/323
* 9/17 * (19/19) = 171/323

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can add them:

* 306/323 + 171/323 = 477/323

This improper fraction can be converted to a mixed number:

* 477/323 = 1 154/323

First, let's convert the mixed number 1 154/323 to an improper fraction:

* 1 154/323 = (323 * 1 + 154)/323 = 477/323

Now, we need a common denominator to add the fractions:

* 477/323 * (20/20) = 9540/6460
* 19/20 * (323/323) = 6137/6460

Finally, we add the fractions:

This improper fraction can be simplified to a mixed number:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We first need to figure out how many gallons of paint Scarlett uses for her art project.  We can do this by multiplying the amount of paint she has by the fraction she uses: 16/10 * 1/20 = 16/200. This simplifies to 2/25 gallons.

Next, to find out how much paint Scarlett has left, we subtract the amount she used from the amount she started with: 16/10 - 2/25.  To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 25 is 50. We can rewrite the fractions as: 80/50 - 4/50.

Finally, we subtract the numerators and keep the denominator: 80/50 - 4/50 = 76/50. This can be simplified to 38/25.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Simplify the fraction:** 10/15 simplifies to 2/3.
* **Convert miles to a common denominator:** 2 miles is equal to 6/3 miles.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this:

1. **Simplify the fraction:** 12/15 simplifies to 4/5.

3. **Subtract the descent:** 10/5 - 4/5 = 6/5 miles.

**However, the plane cannot have a negative altitude. This means the plane would have already hit the ground before descending 12/15 of a mile.**

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance the child slid, we need to add the lengths of the two slides.  However, we need to make sure they have the same denominator before we can add them.

* The first slide is 6/19 meters long.
* The second slide is 17/4 meters long.  We can rewrite this as 17/4 * (19/19) = 323/76 meters long.  This is equivalent to the original fraction, but now they have the same denominator.

Now we can add the two distances:

6/19 + 323/76 = 24/76 + 323/76 = 347/76 meters.

* **First slide:**  (6/5) * (4/4) = 24/20 meters

        If the colonial fireplace burns firewood at a combined rate of 4/15 cords per hour in the early morning and 14/15 cords per hour in the late night, and during the peak hours, it burns an additional 6/5 cords per hour.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find the total firewood burned in one hour by adding the rates for the early morning, late night, and peak hours.
The combined rate for early morning and late night is 4/15 + 14/15 = 18/15 cords per hour.
Adding the peak hour rate, the total firewood burned in one hour is 18/15 + 6/5.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 5 is 15.
So, 18/15 + 6/5 is equivalent to 18/15 + (6*3)/(5*3) = 18/15 + 18/15.
This adds up to 36/15. 
We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3: (36/3) / (15/3) = 12/5.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance travelled, we need to add the two distances together.  However, we need to make sure they have the same denominator before we can add them. 

The least common multiple of 20 and 7 is 140.

*  (9/20) * (7/7) = 63/140
* (11/7) * (20/20) = 220/140

Now we can add the fractions: 63/140 + 220/140 = 283/140

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the first two legs of the journey, which is ((9/20) + (11/7)) light years. 

We need a common denominator to add these fractions:

* (9/20) * (7/7) = 63/140
* (11/7) * (20/20) = 220/140

Adding these gives us: 63/140 + 220/140 = 283/140 light years.

Next, we need to add the additional 14/2 light years.  This simplifies to 7 light years.

To add this to the previous distance, we need a common denominator:

* (283/140) + (7 * 140/140) = 283/140 + 980/140

Finally, we add the numerators: 283/140 + 980/140 = 1263/140
