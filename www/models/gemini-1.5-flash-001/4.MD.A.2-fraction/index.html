        Steve started with 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days. Then he received an extra 11 dollars. John started with 18 dollars but then he spent the same amount of money as Steve had. John found 25 dollars on the street. How much money does John have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Steve spent 38/8 = 4.75 dollars per day.
Steve spent a total of 4.75*8 = 38 dollars.
John spent 38 dollars, so he has 18-38 = -20 dollars left.
Since he can't have negative money, he has 0 dollars left.
John found 25 dollars, so he has 0+25 = 25 dollars.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Daily distance:** Sally rides 47/50 + 31 = 1567/50 miles each day after gaining confidence.
2. **Total distance over 28 days:** She rides 1567/50 * 28 = 8783.2 miles over 28 days.
3. **Extra distance on the detour day:** She added 32/24 = 4/3 miles to her regular distance.
4. **Total distance with detour:** The total distance becomes 8783.2 + 4/3 = 8785.53 miles.

        John drank a special energy drink that increased his jogging speed. After the energy drink, he was able to jog 50/49 miles per hour faster. One day, he had a speed of 4/22 miles per hour without the use of the energy drink. After consuming the energy drink, at what rate would he jog if he continued for 46/30 hours?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to determine the speed of John after he drinks the energy drink.
He was able to jog 50/49 miles per hour faster than his normal speed of 4/22 miles per hour, so his new speed is (50/49) + (4/22) miles per hour.
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 49 and 22 is 1078.
Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 1078: 
(50/49) = (1100/1078) and (4/22) = (196/1078)
Now, we can add them: (1100/1078) + (196/1078) = (1296/1078) miles per hour
Therefore, John's speed after drinking the energy drink is (1296/1078) miles per hour.
However, the question asks for the distance he would travel if he continues for (46/30) hours.
To find the distance, we need to multiply his speed by the time: (1296/1078) * (46/30) 
Simplifying this multiplication: (1296 * 46) / (1078 * 30) = 59568 / 32340
Reducing this fraction: (59568/32340) = (14892/8085)
So, John would jog a distance of (14892/8085) miles.

        A truck driver starts his route with 9 gallons of gas in his tank. He stops at a station and adds to this tank another 21/36 gallons of gas. Later, he stops at another station and adds another 26/42 gallons of gas. How many gallons of gas total does the truck driver have now in his tank?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The truck driver adds 21/36 gallons of gas, which is equivalent to 7/12 gallons after simplification. He then adds another 26/42 gallons of gas, which simplifies to 13/21 gallons.  So, in total, he added 7/12 + 13/21 gallons. To add fractions, we need a common denominator, which is the least common multiple of 12 and 21, which is 84.
Therefore, he added (7/12)*(7/7) + (13/21)*(4/4) = 49/84 + 52/84 = 101/84 gallons.  
To find the total amount of gas in the truck's tank, we add the initial 9 gallons to the amount added: 9 + 101/84 = 756/84 + 101/84 = 857/84 gallons.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  The truck driver has 857/84 gallons of gas. Since each gallon lasts for 35 miles, he can drive (857/84) * 35 = 358.75 miles.

        In the previous problem, we calculated how much fuel the truck driver had after adding 21/36 gallons and 26/42 gallons to 9 original gallons. 

Suppose now we mistakenly thought that the second stop was dispensing fuel faster and he actually added 26/4 gallons instead of 26/42 gallons in the second stop. If he still had the original 9 gallons to start with and added the 21/36 gallons in the first stop as per the original scenario, how much fuel would the truck driver have now in his truck after making both stops?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know the truck driver starts with 9 gallons and adds 21/36 gallons, which simplifies to 7/12 gallons. So he has 9 + 7/12 = 115/12 gallons after the first stop. 

Now, he adds 26/4 gallons, which simplifies to 6.5 gallons.  Adding this to the amount he had after the first stop: 115/12 + 6.5 = 115/12 + 78/12 = 193/12 gallons.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  First, we need to find a common denominator for all the fractions. The least common denominator for 8 and 10 is 40. 

* We can express 6 dollars as 6/1. Multiplying by 40/40, we get 240/40.
* For 47/8, multiply by 5/5 to get 235/40.
* For 41/10, multiply by 4/4 to get 164/40.

Now we can add the fractions: 240/40 + 235/40 + 164/40 = 639/40

We can simplify this improper fraction: 639/40 = 15 39/40

John now has 15 39/40 dollars in total.

        John's house is (17 / 3) miles from his work. The supermarket is (25 / 41) miles closer to his work than his house. 

How far is the supermarket from his work?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how far the supermarket is from work, we need to subtract the distance difference from the distance between John's house and work. 

First, convert the mixed number (17 / 3) to an improper fraction: (17/3) = (51/3).

Then, subtract the distance difference: (51/3) - (25/41) = (2081/123) - (75/123) = (2006/123).

Finally, convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number: (2006/123) = 16 (48/123).

        John wants to save some money to buy a video game. The game costs $40, but John already has $29. 

Every week, John is able to save 20/48 of the money he needs. 

After a certain period of time, he decides to put all his savings so far into an investment account. The account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested after a year. 

How much money will John have in his investment account after a year?

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate how much more money John needs:**
   - John needs $40 - $29 = $11 more.

2. **Calculate how much John saves each week:**
   - John saves (20/48) * $40 = $16.67 (rounded to the nearest cent) per week.

3. **Determine how many weeks it takes John to save the remaining amount:**
   - John needs $11 to save, and he saves $16.67 per week, so it will take him $11 / $16.67 = 0.66 weeks (approximately). Since we can't have fractions of weeks, we'll round this up to 1 week.

4. **Calculate John's total savings:**
   - John saves $16.67 per week for 1 week, so he saves a total of $16.67. 

5. **Calculate the return from the investment:**
   - John invests $16.67 and earns a return of (41/11) * $16.67 = $62.03 (rounded to the nearest cent).

6. **Calculate the total amount in John's investment account:**
   - John initially had $29 + $16.67 = $45.67, and his investment earns him $62.03, so he has a total of $45.67 + $62.03 = $107.70 in his investment account after a year.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To subtract fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15. We can rewrite 13/3 as (13*5)/(3*5) = 65/15. 

Now we can subtract: 65/15 - 32/15 = (65-32)/15 = 33/15.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we simplify 36/3 to 12. Then, to subtract fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 1 and 15 is 15. We can rewrite 12 as 12/1, which is equal to (12*15)/(1*15) = 180/15.

Now we can subtract: 180/15 - 32/15 = (180-32)/15 = 148/15.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Start with his initial amount:** Tom begins with $30.
* **Add the money he found:**  He finds $14, so now he has $30 + $14 = $44.
* **Add the birthday gift:** He receives $25, so his total is now $44 + $25 = $69.

        Following from the previous problem, now Tom decides to do some chores for his neighbor and earns an additional value equivalent to 37/33 dollars. How much money does Tom have now after receiving this additional amount?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem:

* **Tom's current amount:** Tom has $69.
* **Chores earnings:** He earns an additional 37/33 dollars.
* **Total:** To find the total, we add his current amount to his earnings: $69 + 37/33 dollars.

To add these amounts, we need to express them with a common denominator:

* $69 = (69 * 33) / 33 = 2277 / 33$
* Now we can add: (2277 / 33) + (37 / 33) = 2314 / 33

        Jenny is on a running exercise. She ran for 41/32 miles in the first round, and then took a break. After resting, she ran for another 11/4 miles. How many miles in total did she run?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common denominator for 32 and 4 is 32. So, we convert 11/4 to 88/32. Now we can add the fractions: 41/32 + 88/32 = 129/32. This fraction can be simplified to 4 1/32.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the total distance Jenny covered running to the distance she covered cycling.  She ran 4 1/32 miles and cycled 15 miles, so the total distance is 4 1/32 + 15 = 19 1/32 miles.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Find the total juice after mixing:**
   - Add the amounts from the two containers: (23/35) + (50/41) = (943 + 1750) / (1435) = 2693/1435 gallons

2. **Find the remaining space in the bottle after pouring the juice:**
   - Subtract the total juice from the bottle's capacity: 28 - (2693/1435) = (39960 - 2693) / 1435 = 37267/1435 gallons

3. **Find the space left after the customer drinks some juice:**
   - Subtract the amount drunk from the remaining space: (37267/1435) - (11/19) = (707003 - 16555) / 27265 = 690448/27265 gallons

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        John bought a drone that can fly 3 kilometers, but when it's carrying a delivery package, it can only fly 50 / 43 kilometers less. When the drone is attached with an additional booster, it can fly an additional 47 / 15 kilometers. How far can the drone fly with the package and the additional booster attached?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how we can solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the distance the drone can fly with the package:**
   * The drone flies 50/43 kilometers less with the package: 3 km - (50/43) km = (129/43) km

2. **Calculate the distance the drone can fly with the booster:**
   * The booster adds 47/15 kilometers to the drone's range: (129/43) km + (47/15) km = (2633/645) km

3. **Simplify the final answer:**
   * The drone can fly approximately 4.08 kilometers with the package and booster.

### Answer: 4.08 kilometers

        Ann runs 43/18 kilometers every morning and 22/9 kilometers every evening. How many kilometers does she run in a day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common denominator of 18 and 9 is 18. We can rewrite 22/9 as 44/18.
Now, we can add the fractions: 43/18 + 44/18 = 87/18.
This fraction can be simplified: 87/18 = 4 15/18.
So, Ann runs 4 15/18 kilometers in a day.

        Ann has set a daily goal to run 20 kilometers. If she runs 43/18 kilometers every morning and 22/9 kilometers every evening, how many more kilometers does she need to run to meet her daily goal?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the total distance Ann runs in a day. As we calculated before, she runs 4 15/18 kilometers in a day.
To find out how many more kilometers she needs to run, we subtract her total distance from her goal: 20 - 4 15/18 = 15 3/18.
This can be simplified to 15 1/6.
### Answer: 15 1/6

        In the previous question, we learned that Ann has a daily goal to run 20 kilometers. But suppose instead of running 43/18 kilometers every morning, she runs 43/12 kilometers. If she still runs 22/9 kilometers every evening, how many kilometers does she run in total each day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find a common denominator for 12 and 9. The least common denominator is 36. 
*  43/12 can be rewritten as 129/36.
*  22/9 can be rewritten as 88/36.

Now we can add the fractions: 129/36 + 88/36 = 217/36.

This fraction can be simplified to 6 1/36.

        John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days. He began noticing that his apples lasts about as long as 48 ounces of apple juice, which he happens to consume every 42 days. Calculate the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to break down the problem:

1. **Apples per day:** John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days, so he consumes 17 pounds / 8 days = 2.125 pounds of apples per day.

2. **Apple juice per day:** John consumes 48 ounces of apple juice every 42 days, so he consumes 48 ounces / 42 days = 1.143 ounces of apple juice per day.

3. **Apple to apple juice consumption rate:** To find the ratio, we divide the apple consumption rate by the apple juice consumption rate: 2.125 pounds of apples / 1.143 ounces of apple juice = 1.858 pounds of apples per ounce of apple juice.

### Answer: 1.858 pounds of apples per ounce of apple juice.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to figure out how much the tax is. Since 41/14 is an improper fraction, we need to convert it to a mixed number: 41/14 = 2 13/14 dollars.
The total cost of the toy is 18 + 2 13/14 = 20 13/14 dollars.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Jamie's bank added a bonus of $47/41 to her account. To find the total amount she has in her bank account, we need to add the bonus to her initial deposit. So, the total amount is $47 + $47/41 = $47 + $1.146 (approximately) = $48.146. Since we can't have fractions of a cent, we round this down to the nearest cent.

        Tim has a quirky old car with a very unusual fuel consumption - it uses 41/39 liters of fuel per minute. If he drives for 47 minutes, how many litres of fuel will he have consumed?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Simplify the fuel consumption:** 41/39 liters per minute is a bit awkward to work with. We can't simplify the fraction itself, but we can keep it as a fraction and multiply it by the time.

* **Calculate total fuel consumption:**  To find the total fuel used, we multiply the fuel consumption per minute by the number of minutes driven: 
   (41/39 liters/minute) * (47 minutes) = (41 * 47) / 39 liters

* **Simplify the result:**  (41 * 47) / 39 = 1927 / 39 liters

* **Approximate the answer:** Since we can't easily divide 1927 by 39, we can approximate the answer.  1927 is a bit less than 1950, which is 50 times 39. So, the answer is a bit less than 50 liters.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We know Tim already used 1927/39 liters of fuel.  Since his fuel consumption is constant, he'll use another 1927/39 liters in the next 47 minutes.

To find the total fuel consumption, we add the fuel used in the first 47 minutes and the fuel used in the next 47 minutes:

(1927/39 liters) + (1927/39 liters) = 3854/39 liters

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We know Tim's car consumes 41/39 liters of fuel per minute.  If he drives for 31 minutes, we can calculate the total fuel consumption by multiplying:

3. **Add the existing cargo:**  Add the cargo from the containers to the existing cargo: 66.5 tons + 50/11 tons = 66.5 tons + 4.55 tons (approximately)

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with the initial amount:** You begin with 27/6 gallons of water.

2. **Subtract the water poured out:** You remove 5/40 gallons, so subtract that amount: 27/6 - 5/40 

3. **Find a common denominator:** The least common denominator for 6 and 40 is 120. Convert the fractions:
   * 27/6 = (27 * 20) / (6 * 20) = 540/120
   * 5/40 = (5 * 3) / (40 * 3) = 15/120

4. **Subtract the fractions:** 540/120 - 15/120 = 525/120

5. **Add the water added back in:**  You add 21/26 gallons.  Find a common denominator for 120 and 26 (which is 780):
   * 525/120 = (525 * 6.5) / (120 * 6.5) = 3412.5 / 780
   * 21/26 = (21 * 30) / (26 * 30) = 630/780

6. **Add the fractions:** 3412.5/780 + 630/780 = 4042.5/780

7. **Simplify (optional):**  The fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (which is 2.5 in this case): 4042.5 / 780 = 1617/312

**Therefore, after all the actions, there are 1617/312 gallons of water in the tank.**

2. **Subtract the water poured out:** You remove 5/19 gallons, so subtract that amount: 27/6 - 5/19 

3. **Find a common denominator:** The least common denominator for 6 and 19 is 114. Convert the fractions:
   * 27/6 = (27 * 19) / (6 * 19) = 513/114
   * 5/19 = (5 * 6) / (19 * 6) = 30/114

4. **Subtract the fractions:** 513/114 - 30/114 = 483/114

5. **Add the water added back in:**  You add 21/26 gallons.  Find a common denominator for 114 and 26 (which is 1482):
   * 483/114 = (483 * 13) / (114 * 13) = 6279/1482

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find the cost per bag for the old vendor:** 
   - Divide the total cost by the number of bags: $34 / 8 bags = $4.25 per bag

2. **Find the cost per bag for the new vendor:**
   - Divide the total cost by the number of bags: $19 / 30 bags = $0.63 per bag (approximately)

3. **Calculate the difference in price:**
   - Subtract the new vendor's price from the old vendor's price: $4.25 - $0.63 = $3.62

**Therefore, the new vendor charges $3.62 less per bag.**

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many liters you drink, we need to multiply the total juice in the bottle by the fraction you drink: (22/43 liters) * (18/4) 

Simplifying, we get (22*18)/(43*4) = 396/172 liters.

This fraction can be simplified further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4: (396/4)/(172/4) = 99/43 liters.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: You consumed 99/43 liters of juice, and you add the same amount of water to your jugs.

Therefore, you add 99/43 liters of water to your existing 28 liters.

To add these quantities, we need to express 28 liters as a fraction with the same denominator as 99/43: 28 = (28 * 43) / 43 = 1204/43

Now, we can add the two fractions: 1204/43 + 99/43 = (1204 + 99)/43 = 1303/43 liters.

    <p>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of milk, we need to add the initial amount and the additional amount.  

We need to add the fractions 33/37 and 3/25. To do this, we need a common denominator.  The least common multiple of 37 and 25 is 925.  

So, we need to convert the fractions:
* 33/37 = (33 * 25) / (37 * 25) = 825/925
* 3/25 = (3 * 37) / (25 * 37) = 111/925

Now we can add the fractions:
* 825/925 + 111/925 = (825 + 111)/925 = 936/925

Therefore, James has a total of 936/925 gallons of milk in the jug.

        A turtle travels at a speed of 19/6 feet per second. How far, in feet, would the turtle travel in 24 seconds if it starts 20 feet ahead from the starting point?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the distance traveled in 24 seconds:**
   * Distance = Speed x Time
   * Distance = (19/6 feet/second) * 24 seconds
   * Distance = 76 feet

2. **Add the initial distance:**
   * Total distance = Distance traveled + Initial distance
   * Total distance = 76 feet + 20 feet
   * Total distance = 96 feet

        In our earlier calculation, we were considering the distance the turtle travelled in 24 seconds. What happens if we reconsider, and instead calculate the turtle's distance covered in 33 seconds from the same starting point that was 20 feet ahead? How many feet would the turtle travel in total then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's the calculation for the turtle's distance in 33 seconds:

1. **Calculate the distance traveled in 33 seconds:**
   * Distance = Speed x Time
   * Distance = (19/6 feet/second) * 33 seconds
   * Distance = 104.5 feet

2. **Add the initial distance:**
   * Total distance = Distance traveled + Initial distance
   * Total distance = 104.5 feet + 20 feet
   * Total distance = 124.5 feet

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time. In this case, the speed is 39 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours.

        If the train was initially traveling at a speed of 16 kilometers per hour instead of 39 kilometers per hour, how far would the train have travelled in 5 hours?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We'll use the same formula as before: Distance = Speed x Time. 
Now, the speed is 16 kilometers per hour and the time is still 5 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 16 km/h x 5 h = 80 km
