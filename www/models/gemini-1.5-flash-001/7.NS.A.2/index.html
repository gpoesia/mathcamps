    <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators. 

(29/2) * (19/28) = (29 * 19) / (2 * 28) 

Simplifying the multiplication:

(29 * 19) / (2 * 28) = 551 / 56

We can check if this fraction can be simplified by looking for common factors in the numerator and denominator.  In this case, there are no common factors other than 1.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know the product of (29/2) and (19/28) is 551/56.  Now we need to multiply that by 8/28:

(551/56) * (8/28) = (551 * 8) / (56 * 28)

Simplifying the multiplication:

(551 * 8) / (56 * 28) = 4408 / 1568

Now we need to simplify the fraction. Both 4408 and 1568 are divisible by 8:

4408 / 1568 = (4408/8) / (1568/8) = 551/196

We can further simplify by dividing both numerator and denominator by 7:

551/196 = (551/7) / (196/7) = 79/28

        Susan has a recipe that calls for 30 parts of flour to 27 parts of water. If she decides to use 29 parts of flour instead, and she keeps the water proportion the same, how much water will she use? Calculate this using fraction multiplication: ((30 / 30) * (29 / 27)).

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The fraction (30/30) represents the ratio of flour to flour, which is always 1. Multiplying this by (29/27) represents the ratio of the new amount of flour to the original amount of flour, which is then multiplied by the original amount of water (27 parts). So we get (30/30)*(29/27) * 27 = 29.

Now, we multiply:

(288/187) * (3/2) = (288 * 3) / (187 * 2) = 864 / 374

We can simplify this further by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:

Therefore, we have:

Now, we can simplify by canceling common factors:

(25/4) * (6/16) = (25 * 6) / (4 * 16) = (5 * 5 * 2 * 3) / (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 4)

Canceling the common factor of 2:

We can simplify by canceling common factors:

(75 * 19) / (32 * 6) = (3 * 25 * 19) / (2 * 16 * 2 * 3)

Now we simplify by multiplying and canceling common factors:

9 * (6/16) = (9 * 6) / 16 = (3 * 3 * 2 * 3) / (2 * 2 * 2 * 2)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We can simplify this expression by canceling out the common factors:

*  The 19 in the numerator of the first fraction cancels out with the 19 in the denominator of the second fraction.

This leaves us with:

* (18/1) * (1/6)

Now, we multiply the numerators and the denominators:

* (18 * 1) / (1 * 6) = 18/6

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 6:

* 18/6 = 3/1

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators:

(14/10) * (30/5) = (14 * 30) / (10 * 5) 

Simplifying the multiplication:

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 10:

(42/5) * (13/15) = (42 * 13) / (5 * 15)

Simplifying the multiplication:

= 546 / 75

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3:

Now we have the expression (7/4) / (9/8). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of that fraction. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

(7/4) * (8/9)

Now, we can multiply the numerators and the denominators:

        The local bakery was making a special order for a customer. The recipe they are using requires 19/28, and they want to make exactly 30/4 of this recipe. How much of the ingredient will they require?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how much of the ingredient they will need, we need to multiply the amount required by the scaling factor.  

Scaling factor: 30/4 

Amount of ingredient required: 19/28

Multiplying these two fractions: (19/28) * (30/4) = (19*30)/(28*4) = 570/112

Simplifying this multiplication:

9 * (18/20) = (9 * 18) / 20 = 162 / 20.

Simplifying the multiplication:

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. The GCD of 2128 and 600 is 8.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 8:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators.

(24/23) * (23/3) = (24 * 23) / (23 * 3) 

Notice that 23 appears in both the numerator and denominator, and we can cancel them out. This leaves us with:

(24 * 23) / (23 * 3) = 24/3

Now we can simplify this fraction:

24/3 = 8

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know the result of the first multiplication is 8.  Now we need to multiply that by 30/21. 

8 * (30/21) = (8 * 30) / 21

We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3:

(8 * 30) / 21 = (8 * 10) / 7

Now, we can multiply the numerator:

(8 * 10) / 7 = 80 / 7

        Continuing from the previous problem, if we replace the original fraction of 23/3 with 18/3 and keep the 24/23 fraction the same, what now happens to the numerical result when we perform the multiplication?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's compare the two scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** (24/23) * (23/3) = 8 
* **Scenario 2:** (24/23) * (18/3) = ?

Notice that the only difference is the denominator of the second fraction. In Scenario 1, the denominator is 3. In Scenario 2, the denominator is now 3.

Since we are multiplying the fractions, changing the denominator of the second fraction will directly affect the result of the multiplication. 

Because the denominator in Scenario 2 is smaller than the denominator in Scenario 1, the resulting fraction will be larger.  

To calculate the exact result:

(24/23) * (18/3) = (24 * 18) / (23 * 3) = 432/69

This fraction can be simplified, but we can already see that it will be greater than 8, the result from Scenario 1.

        Jim is baking a cake that calls for 12/2 cups of sugar and 17/14 cups of flour. If Jim needs to multiply the amount of sugar and flour he needs for a larger cake, how much sugar and flour does he need in total? Calculate ((12 / 2) * (17 / 14)) and express your answer as a simplified fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  First, simplify the fractions: 12/2 = 6 and 17/14 stays as is. Now, we multiply the two fractions: 6 * (17/14) = (6*17) / (1*14) = 102/14.

Next, we simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of 102 and 14, which is 2. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get: 102/14 = (102/2) / (14/2) = 51/7.

1. **Dividing fractions:** Remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its inverse. So, (21/16) / (27/23) is the same as (21/16) * (23/27).

2. **Multiplication:** Now we multiply the numerators and the denominators: (21 * 23) / (16 * 27).

3. **Simplifying:** We can simplify the fraction by finding common factors between the numerator and denominator.  Both 21 and 27 are divisible by 3, and both 16 and 23 are divisible by 1. This gives us (7 * 23) / (8 * 9).

        Given the result of the previous problem, let's consider a new scenario. Suppose instead of (15 / 3), we have (13 / 3). Now, multiply (13 / 3) * (7 / 25) and write your answer as a simplified fraction. How does this change in scenario affect the final result?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's calculate the new result:

1. **Multiply the fractions:**
   * (13 / 3) * (7 / 25) = (13 * 7) / (3 * 25)

2. **Simplify the result:**
   * (13 * 7) / (3 * 25) = 91 / 75

This result, 91/75, is different from the previous result of 7/5. 

**Here's how the change in scenario affects the final result:**

* **Changing the numerator in the first fraction:**  By changing (15/3) to (13/3), we altered the numerator of the first fraction. This directly impacts the numerator of the final product, leading to a different result (91 instead of 35).

* **Impact on simplification:** While both results can be simplified, they have different simplified forms. The original result (7/5) was already in its simplest form, while the new result (91/75) can be simplified but remains a fraction with larger numbers.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Simplify the fractions:**

* (7 / 2) remains as is.
* (25 / 10) can be simplified to (5 / 2) by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5.

**2. Division of fractions:**

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of (5 / 2) is (2 / 5).

**3. Calculate:**

(7 / 2) / (5 / 2) = (7 / 2) * (2 / 5) 
                       = (7 * 2) / (2 * 5)
                       = 14 / 10

**4. Simplify:**

14/10 can be simplified to 7/5 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2.

Now let's evaluate the new expression:

* First, we simplify the fractions as much as possible: 
    * 20/22 simplifies to 10/11

* Now we have (10/11) * (7/1)

* Multiply the numerators and the denominators: (10 * 7) / (11 * 1) = 70/11

The new expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 2)) is larger than the original ((20 / 22) * (14 / 11)). This is because we are multiplying by a larger fraction (7/1 instead of 14/11).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's multiply the previous result (75/32) by (29/23):

(75/32) * (29/23) = (75 * 29) / (32 * 23) = 2175/736

This new result, **2175/736**, represents a further division or portioning of the original share.

**Scenario Explanation:**

Recall that the original result of 75/32 represented dividing 75 items among 32 people. Now, multiplying by 29/23 implies that we are further dividing each person's original portion (75/32) into 29 smaller pieces and taking 23 of those pieces.

In essence, we are re-dividing the original shares into even smaller portions. Instead of each person getting a large piece (75/32), they are now getting a smaller piece, which is 23/29 of their original portion.

        After solving the previous problem, now evaluate the new expression ((25 / 8) * (29 / 4)). This means we have changed the second fraction from (3 / 4) to (29 / 4).

Under the previous scenario where the fractions referred to sharing or dividing amongst a group, consider what would happen if the proportions you multiplied with were changed to this new ratio. 

Write the result of ((25 / 8) * (29 / 4)) as a simplified fraction and reflect on the impact of this change in the real-world scenario.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's evaluate the expression:

1. **Multiply the numerators:** 25 * 29 = 725
2. **Multiply the denominators:** 8 * 4 = 32
3. **Simplify the result:** 725/32

Therefore, ((25/8) * (29/4)) = **725/32**. 

**Impact on the Real-World Scenario:**

In our previous scenario, we had 75 items to share among 32 people.  Now, with the new ratio (29/4),  we are effectively increasing the share each person receives. 

*  **Original Share:** 75/32 (slightly more than 2 items per person)
* **New Share:** 725/32 (significantly more than 2 items per person)

The change in the ratio from (3/4) to (29/4) implies a substantial increase in the amount being distributed to each individual.  Instead of a small fraction of an extra item, each person now receives a much larger portion. This could be because we have more items to share, or we are dividing the original items into smaller portions.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators. 

(16/6) * (29/27) = (16 * 29) / (6 * 27) = 464 / 162

Now we need to simplify this fraction. Both 464 and 162 are divisible by 2, so we get: 

464 / 162 = 232 / 81

Both 232 and 81 are divisible by 1, but they don't have any other common factors. Therefore, the simplest form of the fraction is 232/81.

464 / 60 = 116 / 15

Both 116 and 15 are divisible by 1, but they don't have any other common factors. Therefore, the simplest form of the fraction is 116/15.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total gallons consumed, we multiply the consumption rate per mile by the total distance: (16/10 gallons/mile) * (13/17 miles).

Simplifying, we get (16 * 13) / (10 * 17) = 208/170.  This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4: (208/4) / (170/4) = 52/42.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem:

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 18/16 is 16/18.

Therefore, we have:

(29 / 10) / (18 / 16) = (29 / 10) * (16 / 18)

Now we can multiply the numerators and the denominators:

(29 * 16) / (10 * 18) = 464 / 180

Finally, we simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor of 464 and 180, which is 4:

464 / 180 = (4 * 116) / (4 * 45) = 116 / 45
