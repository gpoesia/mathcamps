        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Earlier, we found out the value for 9 raised to the third power, right? Now, considering the same scenario, what would be the value if you raise 5 instead of 9 to the power of 3?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">You are correct! We found that 9 raised to the third power is 729.

Now, we want to find the value of 5 raised to the third power, which means 5 multiplied by itself three times: 5 x 5 x 5.

5 x 5 = 25
25 x 5 = 125

        What would be the result if 1 is raised to the 9th power instead of the 5th power?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Any number raised to the power of 1 is equal to itself. This rule applies regardless of the exponent. 

Therefore, 1 raised to the 9th power is still 1. 

### Answer: 1
