This is an example of a final answer for a mathematics problem. Please provide me with the problem and I will write the solution below.

**Problem:**

A train travels a distance of 240 kilometers in 4 hours. What is the average speed of the train in kilometers per hour?

**Solution:**

**Reasoning:**

The average speed of the train is the distance traveled divided by the time taken.

240 kilometers are traveled in 4 hours.

Therefore, the average speed of the train is 240/4 = 60 kilometers per hour.

### Answer: 60
Please provide me with the solution to the following problem:

A farmer has a total of 100 cows. 20 cows are milking, and the rest are resting. How many cows are resting?

### Answer: 80
Please provide me with the solution to the following problem:

A rectangular garden has a length of 10 meters and a width of 5 meters. What is the area of the garden in square meters?

Reasoning: The area of the garden is 10*5 = 50 square meters.
### Answer: 50
Please provide me with the solution to the following problem:

A store has a total of 1000 items. 20% of the items are sold. How many items are left in the store?

Reasoning: The number of items sold is 1000*0.2 = 200 items. The number of items left in the store is 1000 - 200 = 800 items.

This is an example of a final answer for a mathematics problem. Please provide me with the problem and I will write the solution below.

**Problem:**

A train travels a distance of 240 kilometers in 4 hours. What is the average speed of the train in kilometers per hour?

**Solution:**

**Reasoning:**

The average speed of the train is the distance traveled divided by the time taken.

240 kilometers are traveled in 4 hours.

Therefore, the average speed of the train is 240/4 = 60 kilometers per hour.
