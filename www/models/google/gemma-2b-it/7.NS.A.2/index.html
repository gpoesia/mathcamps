        Find the solution to the following multiplication problem: Multiply the fraction 26/9 by the fraction 17/13. Write your answer in simplest form.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To multiply fractions with different denominators, we first need to rewrite them with a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 13 is 63.
So, 26/9 = 26/9 and 17/13 = 17/13.
Now we can multiply the fractions: 26/9 x 17/13 = &lt;&lt;26/9 x 17/13=2&gt;&gt;2.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        In your previous calculation where you multiplied (7 / 7) * (12 / 12), what if instead of 12 in the denominator of the second fraction you have 16? What would be the result of the expression (7 / 7) * (16 / 12)?

        Find the result of ((28 / 6) * (16 / 24)). Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 28/6 = &lt;&lt;28/6=4&gt;&gt;4, and 16/24 = &lt;&lt;16/24=0.625&gt;&gt;0.625.
Therefore, (28/6 * 16/24) = 4 * 0.625 = 2.5.
