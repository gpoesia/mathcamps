        An online sock retailer has just checked their inventory and found that they have a total of 5600.48 meters of materials left. If it takes 98.6 meters of material to make one pair of socks, how many pairs of socks can they make with the amount of material they have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of pairs of socks they can make, we divide the total amount of material by the amount of material in one pair.
5600.48 ÷ 98.6 = &lt;&lt;5600.48 ÷ 98.6 ≈ 57&gt;&gt;57 pairs of socks can be made with the amount of material they have left.

However, now consider that originally, the bus only had a capacity of 28 passengers instead of 68.0, with the same 10.66 seats reserved for specific riders. How many seats would then have been available for general riders before the upgrade?

        A ballerina performed a dance routine that was exactly 93.5 seconds long. She repeated this routine exactly 72.0 times for her various performances, recitals, and practices. How much total time did she spend performing this specific routine?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total time spent performing the dance routine was 93.5 seconds, and she repeated it 72.0 times, each performing for the same duration.
Therefore, the total time spent performing the routine was 93.5 ÷ 72.0 = &lt;&lt;1.3125&gt;&gt;1.3125 hours.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

Therefore, the amount of water consumed every day is:
&lt;br&gt;2833.45 ml ÷ 30.5 days = &lt;&lt;2833.45 ÷ 30.5 ≈ 90.24 ml&gt;&gt;90.24 ml of water.</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: One minute of observation time costs $6.9, so 63.2 minutes would cost $6.9 x 63.2 = &lt;&lt;$40.08&gt;&gt;$40.08.

        Reconsidering the two comets, suppose this time the first comet covered a distance of 61 million kilometers instead of 32.52 million kilometers, and the second traveled the same distance as before, i.e. 27.3 million kilometers. Combining the two, what is the total distance both comets traveled now?
