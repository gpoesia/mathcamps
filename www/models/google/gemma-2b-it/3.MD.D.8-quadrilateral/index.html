        The perimeter of a rectangular swimming pool is 324 meters. The length of the pool is 83 meters. What is the width of the pool?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangular swimming pool is given by the formula P = 2(length + width).
Substituting the values, we get 324 = 2(83 + width).
Solving for width, we get width = (324/2 - 83) = 108 meters.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is given by the formula P = 4s, where P is the perimeter and s is the side length.
Substituting the values, we get 316 = 4s.
