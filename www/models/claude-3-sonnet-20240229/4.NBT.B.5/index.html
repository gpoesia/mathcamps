    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate the total amount of money saved by your friend with the new information.

Given information:
- Your friend saves $125 every year.
- The savings period is 2 years.

Step 1: Find the amount of money saved in the first year.
Amount saved in the first year = $125

Step 2: Find the amount of money saved in the second year.
Amount saved in the second year = $125

Step 3: Find the total amount of money saved by adding the amounts saved in both years.
Total amount of money saved = Amount saved in the first year + Amount saved in the second year
Total amount of money saved = $125 + $125
Total amount of money saved = $250

Therefore, if your friend saved $125 every year for 2 years, they would have managed to save a total of $250.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* The pillow maker originally produced 40 pillows per hour
* They worked for 17 hours
* So originally they produced 40 * 17 = 680 pillows

Now, the new scenario:
* The pillow maker increased their production rate to 460 pillows per hour
* They still worked for the same 17 hours

To calculate the new total pillows produced:
* New production rate (460 pillows per hour) x Hours worked (17 hours) = Total pillows produced
* 460 * 17 = 7,820 pillows

Therefore, with the increased production rate of 460 pillows per hour while working the same 17 hours, the pillow maker would produce 7,820 pillows.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of glasses produced by multiplying the new number of glasses per batch with the number of batches produced in a day.

Given information:
- The manufacturer now produces 821 glasses per batch.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the original size of the object and then add the magnification units to it.

Given information:
- The telescope magnifies an object 67 times.
- Each magnification adds 86 units to the object's size.

Step 1: Find the original size of the object.
Let the original size of the object be x units.
After magnification, the size becomes 67x units.

Step 2: Find the total size of the object with added magnification.
Total size of the object with added magnification = Original size + Magnification units
Total size of the object with added magnification = x + (67 × 86)
Total size of the object with added magnification = x + 5,742

Since we don't know the original size of the object (x), we can represent the total size as an expression.
