        There are 535 fish in a large tank and a shark eats 461 of them in one sitting. If the shark continues this pattern and only eats when there are 461 or more fish to consume, how many fish will be leftover after its dinner?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times the shark can eat 461 fish and then calculate the remaining fish after its last meal.

Given information:
- There are 535 fish in the large tank.
- The shark eats 461 fish in one sitting.
- The shark only eats when there are 461 or more fish to consume.

Step 1: Find the number of times the shark can eat 461 fish.
Number of times the shark can eat 461 fish = Total fish / Fish eaten per sitting
Number of times the shark can eat 461 fish = 535 / 461
Number of times the shark can eat 461 fish = 1 (integer division)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining fish after the shark's last meal.
Remaining fish = Total fish - (Number of times the shark ate × Fish eaten per sitting)
Remaining fish = 535 - (1 × 461)
Remaining fish = 535 - 461
Remaining fish = 74

Therefore, after the shark's dinner, there will be 74 fish left in the large tank.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cookies each orphanage will receive and then calculate the remaining cookies after distributing to all 186 orphanages.

Given information:
- The baker baked a total of 928 cookies.
- The baker wants to distribute equal amounts of cookies to 186 orphanages.

Step 1: Find the number of cookies each orphanage will receive.
Total number of cookies / Number of orphanages = Number of cookies per orphanage
928 cookies / 186 orphanages = 5 cookies per orphanage

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies distributed to all 186 orphanages.
Number of cookies per orphanage × Number of orphanages = Total cookies distributed
5 cookies × 186 orphanages = 930 cookies distributed

Step 3: Find the remaining cookies after distribution.
Total cookies baked - Total cookies distributed = Remaining cookies
928 cookies - 930 cookies = -2 cookies

Since the result is negative, it means that the baker does not have enough cookies to distribute equally to all 186 orphanages.

Therefore, the baker will have 0 cookies left after distributing as many entire sets of cookies as possible to each orphanage.

        A pizza store has 975 slices of pizza ready to serve. If each pizza box can contain 196 slices, how many left over slices will there be after all the pizza boxes are full?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pizza boxes are needed to hold all the slices, and then calculate the remaining slices after filling the boxes.

Given information:
- The pizza store has 975 slices of pizza ready to serve.
- Each pizza box can contain 196 slices.

Step 1: Find the number of pizza boxes needed to hold all the slices.
Number of pizza boxes needed = Total slices / Slices per box
Number of pizza boxes needed = 975 / 196
Number of pizza boxes needed = 4.97 (rounded down to 4 since we can't have a fraction of a box)

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices that can be held in 4 pizza boxes.
Number of slices in 4 pizza boxes = 4 × 196 = 784

Step 3: Calculate the number of leftover slices after filling the pizza boxes.
Number of leftover slices = Total slices - Number of slices in the pizza boxes
Number of leftover slices = 975 - 784 = 191

Therefore, there will be 191 leftover slices after all the pizza boxes are full.

        A wizard casts a spell to summon 932 magical stones. Each powerful creature he summons requires 193 stones. After summoning several creatures, how many stones will the wizard have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many stones the wizard used for summoning the creatures and then subtract that from the total number of stones he summoned.

Given information:
- The wizard summoned 932 magical stones.
- Each powerful creature requires 193 stones.

Step 1: Find the number of creatures the wizard summoned.
Let x be the number of creatures summoned.
Total stones used for summoning creatures = 193x

Since all the stones were used for summoning creatures, we can write the equation:
932 = 193x

Solving for x:
x = 932 / 193
x = 4.83 (rounded down to the nearest whole number)
x = 4 creatures

Step 2: Find the total number of stones used for summoning 4 creatures.
Total stones used = 193 × 4 = 772 stones

Step 3: Find the number of stones left after summoning the creatures.
Stones left = Total stones summoned - Total stones used
Stones left = 932 - 772 = 160 stones

        After summoning several creatures, the wizard found an ancient tome that said each creature actually needed 544 magical stones, not 193. If he had followed this and summoned the creatures based on the 544-stone requirement, how many stones would the wizard have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of stones required for summoning the creatures based on the new information from the ancient tome, and then subtract it from the total number of stones the wizard initially summoned.

Given information:
- The wizard summoned 932 magical stones.
- According to the ancient tome, each powerful creature requires 544 stones (instead of 193 stones).

Step 1: Find the number of creatures the wizard summoned.
We know from the previous problem that the wizard summoned 4 creatures.

Step 2: Find the total number of stones required for summoning 4 creatures based on the new information.
Total stones required = Number of creatures × Stones required per creature
Total stones required = 4 × 544 = 2,176 stones

Step 3: Find the number of stones left after summoning the creatures.
Stones left = Total stones summoned - Total stones required
Stones left = 932 - 2,176 = -1,244 stones

Since the result is negative, it means the wizard did not have enough stones to summon 4 creatures based on the new requirement of 544 stones per creature.

        A builder has a job to install 660 square foot tiles in a house. Each tile can cover 335 square feet. After installing tiles evenly across the available space, how many square feet will the last tile need to cover?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total area that can be covered by the whole tiles and then subtract it from the total area to be covered.

Given information:
- Total area to be covered = 660 square feet
- Area covered by each tile = 335 square feet

Step 1: Find the number of whole tiles that can be installed.
Number of whole tiles = Total area to be covered / Area covered by each tile
Number of whole tiles = 660 square feet / 335 square feet
Number of whole tiles = 1.97 (rounded down to 1)

Step 2: Find the area covered by the whole tiles.
Area covered by whole tiles = Number of whole tiles × Area covered by each tile
Area covered by whole tiles = 1 × 335 square feet
Area covered by whole tiles = 335 square feet

Step 3: Find the remaining area to be covered by the last tile.
Remaining area = Total area to be covered - Area covered by whole tiles
Remaining area = 660 square feet - 335 square feet
Remaining area = 325 square feet

Therefore, the last tile needs to cover an area of 325 square feet.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to recalculate the area covered by the whole tiles and then find the remaining area to be covered by the last tile.

Given information:
- Total area to be covered = 660 square feet
- Area covered by each tile = 337 square feet (updated value)

Step 1: Find the number of whole tiles that can be installed.
Number of whole tiles = Total area to be covered / Area covered by each tile
Number of whole tiles = 660 square feet / 337 square feet
Number of whole tiles = 1.96 (rounded down to 1)

Step 2: Find the area covered by the whole tiles.
Area covered by whole tiles = Number of whole tiles × Area covered by each tile
Area covered by whole tiles = 1 × 337 square feet
Area covered by whole tiles = 337 square feet

Step 3: Find the remaining area to be covered by the last tile.
Remaining area = Total area to be covered - Area covered by whole tiles
Remaining area = 660 square feet - 337 square feet
Remaining area = 323 square feet

Therefore, with the updated tile size of 337 square feet, the last tile needs to cover an area of 323 square feet.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many containers can be filled with the total amount of juice produced, and then calculate the remaining juice after filling up all the containers.

Given information:
- The juice company produced 473 gallons of juice.
- The juice is bottled in 22-gallon containers.

Step 1: Find the number of containers that can be filled with 473 gallons of juice.
Number of containers = Total juice produced / Capacity of each container
Number of containers = 473 gallons / 22 gallons per container
Number of containers = 21.5 containers

Since we cannot have a fractional number of containers, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.
Number of containers = 21 containers

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of juice that can be bottled in 21 containers.
Total juice bottled = Number of containers × Capacity of each container
Total juice bottled = 21 containers × 22 gallons per container
Total juice bottled = 462 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the remaining juice after filling up all the containers.
Remaining juice = Total juice produced - Total juice bottled
Remaining juice = 473 gallons - 462 gallons
Remaining juice = 11 gallons

Therefore, after filling up all the containers, there will be 11 gallons of juice left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many containers can be filled with the total amount of juice produced (599 gallons), and then calculate the remaining juice after filling up all the containers.

Given information:
- The juice company produced 599 gallons of juice.
- The juice is bottled in 22-gallon containers.

Step 1: Find the number of containers that can be filled with 599 gallons of juice.
Number of containers = Total juice produced / Capacity of each container
Number of containers = 599 gallons / 22 gallons per container
Number of containers = 27.23 containers

Since we cannot have a fractional number of containers, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.
Number of containers = 27 containers

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of juice that can be bottled in 27 containers.
Total juice bottled = Number of containers × Capacity of each container
Total juice bottled = 27 containers × 22 gallons per container
Total juice bottled = 594 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the remaining juice after filling up all the containers.
Remaining juice = Total juice produced - Total juice bottled
Remaining juice = 599 gallons - 594 gallons

Step 1: Find the number of boxes required to pack all the toy cars.
Number of boxes required = Total number of toy cars / Number of toy cars per box
Number of boxes required = 979 / 108
Number of boxes required = 9.0648... (rounded down to 9 boxes)

Step 2: Calculate the number of toy cars that can be packed in 9 boxes.
Number of toy cars packed in 9 boxes = 9 × 108 = 972 toy cars

Step 3: Calculate the number of toy cars left unpacked.
Number of toy cars left unpacked = Total number of toy cars - Number of toy cars packed in boxes
Number of toy cars left unpacked = 979 - 972 = 7 toy cars

Therefore, 7 toy cars will be left unpacked at the end of the day.

Given information:
- The toy factory produced 979 toy cars in a day.
- Each larger box can hold 684 toy cars.

Step 1: Find the number of larger boxes required to pack all the toy cars.
Number of larger boxes required = Total number of toy cars / Number of toy cars per larger box
Number of larger boxes required = 979 / 684
Number of larger boxes required = 1.4311... (rounded down to 1 larger box)

Step 2: Calculate the number of toy cars that can be packed in 1 larger box.
Number of toy cars packed in 1 larger box = 1 × 684 = 684 toy cars

Step 3: Calculate the number of toy cars left unpacked.
Number of toy cars left unpacked = Total number of toy cars - Number of toy cars packed in larger boxes
Number of toy cars left unpacked = 979 - 684 = 295 toy cars

Step 1: Find the number of boxes required to hold all the crayons.
Number of boxes required = Total crayons produced / Crayons per box
Number of boxes required = 994 / 425
Number of boxes required = 2.34 (rounded down to 2 since we can't have a fractional number of boxes)

Step 2: Calculate the number of crayons that can be held in 2 boxes.
Number of crayons in 2 boxes = 2 × 425 = 850 crayons

Step 3: Calculate the remaining crayons that won't fit into the boxes.

Given information:
- The factory made 223 crayons in one operation.
- Each box holds 425 crayons.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes required to hold all the crayons.
Number of boxes required = Total crayons produced / Crayons per box
Number of boxes required = 223 / 425
Number of boxes required = 0.525 (rounded down to 0 since we can't have a fractional number of boxes)

Step 2: Calculate the number of crayons that can be held in 0 boxes (which is 0).
Number of crayons in 0 boxes = 0 × 425 = 0 crayons

Step 3: Calculate the remaining crayons that won't fit into the boxes.
Remaining crayons = Total crayons produced - Number of crayons in 0 boxes
Remaining crayons = 223 - 0 = 223 crayons

Therefore, since no boxes are needed to hold the 223 crayons produced, all 223 crayons will be left over and fail to make it into a box.

        A wildlife reserve has 740 tigers. The reserve is divided into different zones, and each zone can only hold up to 696 tigers. If tigers are distributed evenly among the zones, how many tigers will be left in the last zone?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of zones required to accommodate all the tigers, and then calculate the remainder of tigers that will be left in the last zone.

Given information:
- The wildlife reserve has 740 tigers.
- Each zone can hold up to 696 tigers.

Step 1: Find the number of zones required to accommodate all the tigers.
Number of zones required = Total number of tigers / Maximum capacity of each zone
Number of zones required = 740 / 696
Number of zones required = 1.063 (rounded up to 2 zones)

Step 2: Calculate the number of tigers that can be accommodated in the first zone.
Number of tigers in the first zone = 696 (maximum capacity)

Step 3: Calculate the number of tigers remaining after accommodating the first zone.
Number of tigers remaining = Total number of tigers - Number of tigers in the first zone
Number of tigers remaining = 740 - 696 = 44

Step 4: Since there are only two zones, the remaining 44 tigers will be accommodated in the second zone.

Therefore, the number of tigers left in the last (second) zone is 44.

        Consider the wildlife reserve again. This time, however, the zones have been expanded and each can now accommodate up to 908 tigers. If the 740 tigers are distributed evenly among the expanded zones, how many tigers will be left in the last zone?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of zones required to accommodate all the tigers, and then calculate the remainder of tigers that will be left in the last zone.

Given information:
- The wildlife reserve has 740 tigers.
- Each expanded zone can hold up to 908 tigers.

Step 1: Find the number of zones required to accommodate all the tigers.
Number of zones required = Total number of tigers / Maximum capacity of each zone
Number of zones required = 740 / 908
Number of zones required = 0.815 (rounded up to 1 zone)

Step 2: Since only one zone is required, all 740 tigers will be accommodated in this single zone.

Step 3: Calculate the number of tigers remaining after accommodating the maximum capacity of the zone.
Number of tigers remaining = Total number of tigers - Maximum capacity of the zone
Number of tigers remaining = 740 - 908 = -168

Since the result is negative, it means that the maximum capacity of the zone (908 tigers) is greater than the total number of tigers (740 tigers).

Therefore, there will be no tigers left in the last zone, as all 740 tigers can be accommodated within the single expanded zone.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boxes that can be filled with the available hats, and then calculate the remaining hats that cannot be put into a full box.

Given information:
- The hat shop makes 830 hats every week.
- Each special edition box will contain 421 hats.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes that can be filled with the available hats.
Number of boxes = Total number of hats / Number of hats per box
Number of boxes = 830 / 421
Number of boxes = 1.97 (rounded down to 1 since we cannot have a partial box)

Step 2: Calculate the number of hats that can be put into the boxes.
Number of hats in boxes = Number of boxes × Number of hats per box
Number of hats in boxes = 1 × 421 = 421 hats

Step 3: Calculate the number of hats left over.
Number of hats left over = Total number of hats - Number of hats in boxes
Number of hats left over = 830 - 421 = 409 hats

Therefore, 409 hats will be left over after filling the special edition boxes.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of fish remaining after the fisherman catches 575 fish from the initial population of 871 fish.

Given information:
- There are 871 fish in the lake initially.
- The fisherman catches 575 fish every month.
- The fish repopulate at the same rate that the fisherman is depleting them.

Step 1: Find the number of fish remaining after the fisherman catches 575 fish.
Initial number of fish - Number of fish caught = Number of fish remaining
871 - 575 = 296 fish remaining

Step 2: Since the fish repopulate at the same rate that the fisherman is depleting them, the number of fish remaining after a month will be the same as the initial population.

Number of fish remaining after a month = Initial number of fish
Number of fish remaining after a month = 871 fish

Therefore, after a month, there will be 871 fish left in the lake.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of beach bags required to hold all the beach balls and then calculate the remaining beach balls that won't fit.

Given information:
- There are 891 beach balls.
- Each beach bag can fit 119 beach balls.

Step 1: Find the number of beach bags required to hold all the beach balls.
Number of beach bags required = Total number of beach balls / Number of beach balls per bag
Number of beach bags required = 891 / 119
Number of beach bags required = 7.49 (rounded down to 7 since we can't have a fraction of a bag)

Step 2: Calculate the number of beach balls that can be placed in the 7 bags.
Number of beach balls that can be placed = Number of bags × Number of beach balls per bag
Number of beach balls that can be placed = 7 × 119 = 833

Step 3: Calculate the number of beach balls that won't fit and will be left over.
Number of beach balls left over = Total number of beach balls - Number of beach balls that can be placed
Number of beach balls left over = 891 - 833 = 58

Therefore, 58 beach balls will not fit and will be left over.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of beach bags required to hold all the beach balls and then calculate the remaining beach balls that won't fit.

Given information:
- There are 901 beach balls.
- Each beach bag can fit 119 beach balls.

Step 1: Find the number of beach bags required to hold all the beach balls.
Number of beach bags required = Total number of beach balls / Number of beach balls per bag
Number of beach bags required = 901 / 119
Number of beach bags required = 7.57 (rounded up to 8 since we need a whole number of bags)

Step 2: Calculate the number of beach balls that can be placed in the 8 bags.
Number of beach balls that can be placed = Number of bags × Number of beach balls per bag
Number of beach balls that can be placed = 8 × 119 = 952

Step 3: Calculate the number of beach balls that won't fit and will be left over.
Number of beach balls left over = Total number of beach balls - Number of beach balls that can be placed
Number of beach balls left over = 901 - 952 = -51

Since the result is negative, it means that all the beach balls can be placed in the 8 bags, and there will be no beach balls left over.

Therefore, 0 beach balls will be left over.

Given information:
- There are 544 stars in the constellation.
- The stars are grouped into smaller clusters of 446 stars each.

Step 1: Find the number of complete clusters that can be formed.
Number of complete clusters = Total number of stars / Number of stars per cluster
Number of complete clusters = 544 / 446
Number of complete clusters = 1 (since 544 is not divisible by 446)

Step 2: Calculate the number of stars in the complete clusters.
Number of stars in complete clusters = Number of complete clusters × Number of stars per cluster
Number of stars in complete clusters = 1 × 446 = 446

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining stars that cannot be grouped into complete clusters.
Number of remaining stars = Total number of stars - Number of stars in complete clusters
Number of remaining stars = 544 - 446 = 98

Therefore, 98 stars will remain ungrouped after forming the complete clusters.

Given information:
- There are 278 stars in the constellation.
- The stars are grouped into smaller clusters of 446 stars each.

Step 1: Find the number of complete clusters that can be formed.
Number of complete clusters = Total number of stars / Number of stars per cluster
Number of complete clusters = 278 / 446
Number of complete clusters = 0 (since 278 is less than 446)

Step 2: Since there are no complete clusters formed, all the stars will remain ungrouped.

Therefore, all 278 stars will remain ungrouped after attempting to form complete clusters of 446 stars each.

Given information:
- The manufacturer produces 805 socks in one shift.
- The socks are packaged into sets of 132 each.

Step 1: Find the number of sets that can be packaged.
Number of sets = Total number of socks / Number of socks per set
Number of sets = 805 / 132
Number of sets = 6 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Calculate the number of socks packaged.
Number of socks packaged = Number of sets × Number of socks per set
Number of socks packaged = 6 × 132
Number of socks packaged = 792

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining unpackaged socks.
Number of remaining unpackaged socks = Total number of socks - Number of socks packaged
Number of remaining unpackaged socks = 805 - 792

Number of nights required = 759 / 228
Number of nights required = 3.33 (rounded down to 3 since we cannot have a partial night)

Step 2: Find the number of members who will view the event in the first 2 nights.
Number of members in the first 2 nights = 2 × 228 = 456

Step 3: Find the number of members remaining for the final night.

Number of jumps = 3 (since we need to consider whole jumps)

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flies eaten by the frog.
Total number of flies eaten = Number of jumps × Number of flies eaten in each jump
Total number of flies eaten = 3 × 258
Total number of flies eaten = 774

Step 3: Calculate the number of flies left after the frog's jumps.
Number of flies left = Initial number of flies - Total number of flies eaten
Number of flies left = 941 - 774
Number of flies left = 167

Therefore, after the series of jumps where the frog eats the same number of flies in each jump, 167 flies are left.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Previously, a frog ate flies from a total of 941 flies with 258 flies eaten in each jump. Now, consider that instead of 941 flies there initially were 146 flies hopping around the pond. Given that the frog still eats 258 flies in each jump, how many flies would be left after a series of jumps?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times the frog can jump and eat flies, and then subtract the total number of flies eaten from the initial number of flies.

Given information:
- There are 146 flies initially.
- Every time the frog jumps, it eats exactly 258 flies.
- The frog eats the same number of flies in each jump.

Step 1: Find the number of times the frog can jump.
Number of flies eaten in each jump = 258
Total number of flies = 146
Number of jumps = Total number of flies / Number of flies eaten in each jump
Number of jumps = 146 / 258
Number of jumps = 0 (since we need to consider whole jumps)

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flies eaten by the frog.
Total number of flies eaten = Number of jumps × Number of flies eaten in each jump
Total number of flies eaten = 0 × 258
Total number of flies eaten = 0

Step 3: Calculate the number of flies left after the frog's jumps.
Number of flies left = Initial number of flies - Total number of flies eaten
Number of flies left = 146 - 0
Number of flies left = 146

Therefore, since the frog cannot make any complete jumps (as 146 is less than 258), no flies are eaten, and 146 flies are left after the series of jumps.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of spaces in each row and then calculate the remaining spaces in the last row.

Given information:
- The park has a capacity of 991 spaces for cars to park.
- The spaces are evenly distributed between 66 rows.

Step 1: Find the number of spaces in each row.
Total number of spaces / Number of rows = Number of spaces in each row
991 spaces / 66 rows = 15 spaces in each row

Step 2: Calculate the total number of spaces filled in the first 65 rows.
Number of spaces in each row × Number of rows (except the last row) = Total spaces filled in the first 65 rows
15 spaces × 65 rows = 975 spaces

Step 3: Find the remaining spaces in the last row.
Total number of spaces - Total spaces filled in the first 65 rows = Remaining spaces in the last row
991 spaces - 975 spaces = 16 spaces

Therefore, there will be 16 spare spaces in the last row after the maximum spaces are filled.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum amount of water that can be distributed evenly among the 167 water bottles, and then subtract it from the total amount of water (193 liters) to find the amount of water that overflows.

Given information:
- Total amount of water = 193 liters.
- Number of water bottles = 167.

Step 1: Find the maximum amount of water that can be distributed evenly among the 167 water bottles.
Maximum amount of water that can be distributed evenly = Largest whole number that divides 193 liters by 167.
193 liters ÷ 167 bottles = 1.155689 liters per bottle.
The largest whole number that divides 193 liters by 167 is 1 liter per bottle.
Maximum amount of water that can be distributed evenly = 1 liter × 167 bottles = 167 liters.

Step 2: Find the amount of water that overflows.
Amount of water that overflows = Total amount of water - Maximum amount of water that can be distributed evenly.
Amount of water that overflows = 193 liters - 167 liters = 26 liters.

Therefore, 26 liters of water will overflow and cannot be distributed to the bottles.

Given information:
- Total amount of water = 857 liters.
- Number of water bottles = 167.

Step 1: Find the maximum amount of water that can be distributed evenly among the 167 water bottles.
Maximum amount of water that can be distributed evenly = Largest whole number that divides 857 liters by 167.
857 liters ÷ 167 bottles = 5.131737 liters per bottle.
The largest whole number that divides 857 liters by 167 is 5 liters per bottle.
Maximum amount of water that can be distributed evenly = 5 liters × 167 bottles = 835 liters.

Step 2: Find the amount of water that overflows.
Amount of water that overflows = Total amount of water - Maximum amount of water that can be distributed evenly.
Amount of water that overflows = 857 liters - 835 liters = 22 liters.

Therefore, 22 liters of water will overflow and cannot be distributed to the bottles.

Given information:
- The dragon lays 996 jewel eggs.
- Each row can hold 319 eggs.

Step 1: Find the number of complete rows that can be formed with 996 eggs.
Number of complete rows = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per row
Number of complete rows = 996 / 319
Number of complete rows = 3 (since 996 / 319 = 3.12, we take the integer part)

Step 2: Find the number of eggs that can be placed in the complete rows.
Number of eggs in complete rows = Number of complete rows × Number of eggs per row
Number of eggs in complete rows = 3 × 319 = 957

Step 3: Find the number of remaining eggs that will be placed in the last row.
Number of remaining eggs = Total number of eggs - Number of eggs in complete rows
Number of remaining eggs = 996 - 957 = 39

Therefore, 39 eggs would be left over to be put in the last row.

Given information:
- The lamp manufacturer produces 691 bulb units.
- Each pack includes 205 bulbs.

Step 1: Find the number of packs that can be filled with the available bulbs.
Number of packs = Total number of bulbs / Number of bulbs per pack
Number of packs = 691 / 205
Number of packs = 3 (since we need to round down to the nearest whole number)

Step 2: Calculate the number of bulbs used to fill the packs.
Number of bulbs used = Number of packs × Number of bulbs per pack
Number of bulbs used = 3 × 205
Number of bulbs used = 615

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining unpacked bulbs.
Number of remaining unpacked bulbs = Total number of bulbs - Number of bulbs used
Number of remaining unpacked bulbs = 691 - 615

Given information:
- There are 330 bales of hay.
- Each barn can store up to 259 bales.

Step 1: Find the number of barns required to store all the bales of hay.
Number of bales of hay / Maximum capacity of each barn = Number of barns required
330 bales / 259 bales per barn = 1.27 barns

Since we cannot have a fractional number of barns, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
Number of barns required = 2 barns

Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of the two barns.
Total capacity = 2 barns × 259 bales per barn = 518 bales

Step 3: Calculate the remaining bales for the last barn.
Remaining bales = Total bales of hay - Total capacity of the barns
Remaining bales = 330 bales - 518 bales = -188 bales

Since the result is negative, it means that the two barns can accommodate all the bales of hay, and there will be no remaining bales for the last barn.

Given information:
- The construction company is installing 166 windows on a building.
- One installation team can install 137 windows per day.
- All windows are equally distributed among teams each day.

Step 1: Find the number of installation teams required.
Number of installation teams = Total number of windows / Number of windows one team can install per day
Number of installation teams = 166 / 137
Number of installation teams = 1.21 (rounded up to 2 teams)

Step 2: Find the number of windows each team can install in a day.
Number of windows each team can install per day = Total number of windows / Number of installation teams
Number of windows each team can install per day = 166 / 2
Number of windows each team can install per day = 83 windows

Step 3: Find the number of windows remaining for the next day.
Number of windows remaining = Total number of windows - (Number of windows each team can install per day × Number of installation teams)
Number of windows remaining = 166 - (83 × 2)

Given information:
- There are 999 seashells collected.
- Each souvenir set contains 474 shells.

Step 1: Find the number of sets that can be made from 999 seashells.
Number of sets = Total seashells / Seashells per set
Number of sets = 999 / 474
Number of sets = 2 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Calculate the number of seashells used in the sets.
Number of seashells used in sets = Number of sets × Seashells per set
Number of seashells used in sets = 2 × 474
Number of seashells used in sets = 948

Step 3: Calculate the number of seashells left without a set.
Number of seashells left without a set = Total seashells - Number of seashells used in sets
Number of seashells left without a set = 999 - 948
Number of seashells left without a set = 51

        In continuation of the previous scenario with seashells, imagine instead that there were initially only 234 seashells collected from the beach, but the souvenir sets are still made up of 474 shells each. How many shells would be left after attempting to form these sets?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this scenario, we have 234 seashells collected from the beach, and each souvenir set contains 474 shells.

Given information:
- Total seashells collected = 234
- Seashells per set = 474

To find the number of seashells left after attempting to form the sets, we need to determine how many complete sets can be made from the available seashells.

Step 1: Find the number of complete sets that can be made from 234 seashells.
Number of complete sets = Total seashells / Seashells per set
Number of complete sets = 234 / 474
Number of complete sets = 0 (since 234 is less than 474)

Step 2: Calculate the number of seashells left after attempting to form the sets.
Number of seashells left = Total seashells - (Number of complete sets × Seashells per set)
Number of seashells left = 234 - (0 × 474)
Number of seashells left = 234

Since no complete set can be formed with 234 seashells when each set requires 474 shells, all 234 seashells will be left without forming any set.

Therefore, after attempting to form souvenir sets of 474 shells each, there will be 234 seashells left.

        A tailor has 366 meters of fabric. If each skirt requires 160 meters of fabric, how many meters of fabric will be left after making as many skirts as possible?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many skirts can be made with the available fabric and then calculate the remaining fabric after making those skirts.

Given information:
- The tailor has 366 meters of fabric.
- Each skirt requires 160 meters of fabric.

Step 1: Find the number of skirts that can be made with the available fabric.
Number of skirts = Total fabric / Fabric required for one skirt
Number of skirts = 366 meters / 160 meters per skirt
Number of skirts = 2.2875 (rounded down to 2 since we cannot have a fractional skirt)

Step 2: Calculate the fabric used for making 2 skirts.
Fabric used for 2 skirts = 2 × 160 meters = 320 meters

Step 3: Calculate the remaining fabric after making 2 skirts.
Remaining fabric = Total fabric - Fabric used for 2 skirts
Remaining fabric = 366 meters - 320 meters = 46 meters

Therefore, after making as many skirts as possible, 46 meters of fabric will be left.

Given information:
- The tailor has 21 meters of fabric.
- Each skirt requires 160 meters of fabric.

Step 1: Find the number of skirts that can be made with the available fabric.
Number of skirts = Total fabric / Fabric required for one skirt
Number of skirts = 21 meters / 160 meters per skirt
Number of skirts = 0.13125 (rounded down to 0 since we cannot have a fractional skirt)

Since the tailor cannot make even a single skirt with the available fabric, no fabric will be used.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining fabric after making 0 skirts.
Remaining fabric = Total fabric - Fabric used for 0 skirts
Remaining fabric = 21 meters - 0 meters = 21 meters

Therefore, after making as many skirts as possible (which is none), 21 meters of fabric will be left.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many boxes are required to pack all the dolls, and then calculate the remaining dolls after packing the boxes to their full capacity.

Given information:
- The toymaker made 993 dolls.
- Each box can hold 327 dolls.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes required to pack all the dolls.
Number of boxes required = Total number of dolls / Number of dolls per box
Number of boxes required = 993 / 327
Number of boxes required = 3 (since we need to round down to the nearest whole number)

Step 2: Calculate the number of dolls that can be packed in the boxes.
Number of dolls packed in boxes = Number of boxes × Number of dolls per box
Number of dolls packed in boxes = 3 × 327 = 981

Step 3: Calculate the remaining dolls after packing the boxes.
Remaining dolls = Total number of dolls - Number of dolls packed in boxes
Remaining dolls = 993 - 981 = 12

Therefore, the toymaker will have 12 dolls left once all the boxes are packed to their capacities.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the new information.

Given information:
- The toymaker made 993 dolls.
- Each box can hold 115 dolls.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes required to pack all the dolls.
Number of boxes required = Total number of dolls / Number of dolls per box
Number of boxes required = 993 / 115
Number of boxes required = 8.63 (rounded down to 8 since we can't have a fractional number of boxes)

Step 2: Calculate the number of dolls that can be packed in the boxes.
Number of dolls packed in boxes = Number of boxes × Number of dolls per box
Number of dolls packed in boxes = 8 × 115 = 920

Step 3: Calculate the remaining dolls after packing the boxes.
Remaining dolls = Total number of dolls - Number of dolls packed in boxes
Remaining dolls = 993 - 920 = 73

Therefore, if each box can hold 115 dolls, the toymaker will have 73 dolls left after packing all the boxes to their capacities.

Given information:
- The child has 964 stuffed animals.
- The child wants to divide the stuffed animals equally among 839 friends.

Step 1: Divide the total number of stuffed animals by the number of friends.
Number of stuffed animals per friend = Total number of stuffed animals / Number of friends
Number of stuffed animals per friend = 964 / 839
Number of stuffed animals per friend = 1.148 (rounded down to the nearest whole number)

Step 2: Calculate the number of stuffed animals distributed to the friends.
Number of stuffed animals distributed = Number of friends × Number of stuffed animals per friend
Number of stuffed animals distributed = 839 × 1
Number of stuffed animals distributed = 839

Step 3: Calculate the number of stuffed animals left over.
Number of stuffed animals left over = Total number of stuffed animals - Number of stuffed animals distributed
Number of stuffed animals left over = 964 - 839
Number of stuffed animals left over = 125

Step 1: Find the number of rings that can be placed in each box.
Number of rings per box = Total number of rings / Number of boxes
Number of rings per box = 843 / 839
Number of rings per box = 1 (since we need to place the rings equally)

Step 2: Find the total number of rings that can be placed in the boxes.
Total number of rings that can be placed = Number of rings per box × Number of boxes
Total number of rings that can be placed = 1 × 839
Total number of rings that can be placed = 839

Step 3: Find the number of rings left over.
Number of rings left over = Total number of rings - Total number of rings that can be placed

Step 1: Find the number of rings that can be placed in each box.
Number of rings per box = Total number of rings / Number of boxes
Number of rings per box = 843 / 804
Number of rings per box = 1 (since we need to place the rings equally)

Step 2: Find the total number of rings that can be placed in the boxes.

Number of fireplaces = 1 (since we cannot build a fraction of a fireplace)

Step 2: Calculate the number of bricks used to build the fireplaces.
Number of bricks used = Number of fireplaces × Number of bricks required per fireplace
Number of bricks used = 1 × 583 = 583 bricks

Step 3: Calculate the number of bricks left over.
Number of bricks left over = Total number of bricks - Number of bricks used
Number of bricks left over = 819 - 583 = 236 bricks

Therefore, after building as many fireplaces as possible, the company will have 236 bricks left over.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fireplaces the company can build with the available bricks, and then calculate the remaining bricks after building those fireplaces.

Given information:
- The company now has 486 bricks in total.
- Each fireplace requires 583 bricks.

Step 1: Find the number of fireplaces the company can build.
Number of fireplaces = Total number of bricks / Number of bricks required per fireplace
Number of fireplaces = 486 / 583
Number of fireplaces = 0 (since we cannot build a fraction of a fireplace)

Step 2: Calculate the number of bricks used to build the fireplaces.
Number of bricks used = Number of fireplaces × Number of bricks required per fireplace
Number of bricks used = 0 × 583 = 0 bricks

Step 3: Calculate the number of bricks left over.
Number of bricks left over = Total number of bricks - Number of bricks used
Number of bricks left over = 486 - 0 = 486 bricks

Therefore, after building as many full fireplaces as possible with the new total of 486 bricks, the company will have 486 bricks left over.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of marshmallows produced in a minute and the total capacity of the packaging machines.

Given information:
- The marshmallow factory produces 998 marshmallows per minute.
- The packaging machine can hold 957 marshmallows at a time.

Step 1: Find the total capacity of the packaging machines.
Total capacity of the packaging machines = 957 marshmallows

Step 2: Find the difference between the number of marshmallows produced and the total capacity of the packaging machines.
Number of marshmallows left un-packaged = Number of marshmallows produced - Total capacity of the packaging machines
Number of marshmallows left un-packaged = 998 - 957

Step 1: Find the total capacity of the new packaging machines.
Total capacity of the new packaging machines = 804 marshmallows

Step 2: Find the difference between the number of marshmallows produced and the total capacity of the new packaging machines.
Number of marshmallows left un-packaged = Number of marshmallows produced - Total capacity of the new packaging machines

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many tributes can be created with the available roses, and then calculate the remaining roses after distributing them evenly.

Given information:
- There are 984 roses in the castle's garden.
- Each tribute requires 426 roses.

Step 1: Find the number of tributes that can be created with the available roses.
Number of tributes = Total number of roses / Number of roses per tribute
Number of tributes = 984 / 426
Number of tributes = 2 (since we need to distribute the roses evenly)

Step 2: Calculate the number of roses distributed for the tributes.
Number of roses distributed = Number of tributes × Number of roses per tribute
Number of roses distributed = 2 × 426
Number of roses distributed = 852

Step 3: Calculate the number of roses left undistributed.
Number of roses left undistributed = Total number of roses - Number of roses distributed
Number of roses left undistributed = 984 - 852
Number of roses left undistributed = 132

- Each tribute requires 730 roses.

Step 1: Find the number of tributes that can be created with the available roses.
Number of tributes = Total number of roses / Number of roses per tribute
Number of tributes = 984 / 730
Number of tributes = 1 (since we need to distribute the roses evenly)

Step 2: Calculate the number of roses distributed for the tribute.
Number of roses distributed = Number of tributes × Number of roses per tribute

Number of complete lines = Total words in the song / Words per line
Number of complete lines = 334 / 23
Number of complete lines = 14 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Calculate the number of words in the incomplete line.
Number of words in the incomplete line = Total words in the song - (Number of complete lines × Words per line)
Number of words in the incomplete line = 334 - (14 × 23)

Step 1: Find the number of times the printer needs to be filled to print all the pages.
Number of times the printer needs to be filled = Total number of pages / Number of pages printed in one go
Number of times the printer needs to be filled = 928 / 336
Number of times the printer needs to be filled = 2 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Find the number of pages printed after filling the printer twice.
Number of pages printed = Number of times the printer is filled × Number of pages printed in one go
Number of pages printed = 2 × 336 = 672 pages

Step 3: Find the number of pages left over to print.
Number of pages left over = Total number of pages - Number of pages printed

Step 1: Find the number of boxes required to hold all the blocks of cheese.
Number of boxes required = Total blocks of cheese / Blocks per box
Number of boxes required = 686 / 349
Number of boxes required = 1.97 (rounded down to 1 since we cannot have a fractional number of boxes)

Step 2: Calculate the number of blocks that can be placed in the boxes.
Number of blocks in the boxes = Number of boxes × Blocks per box
Number of blocks in the boxes = 1 × 349 = 349

Step 3: Calculate the remaining blocks of cheese after filling the boxes.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes required to hold all the blocks of cheese.
Number of boxes required = Total blocks of cheese / Blocks per box
Number of boxes required = 239 / 349
Number of boxes required = 0.68 (rounded down to 0 since we cannot have a fractional number of boxes)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times the snowplow can clear 170 centimeters of snow from the total snowfall of 513 centimeters.

Given information:
- Total snowfall = 513 centimeters
- The snowplow can clear up to 170 centimeters of snow at a time.

Step 1: Find the number of times the snowplow can clear 170 centimeters of snow.
Number of times = Total snowfall / Amount of snow cleared per pass
Number of times = 513 cm / 170 cm
Number of times = 3 (since we can't have a partial pass)

Step 2: Calculate the amount of snow cleared by the snowplow.
Amount of snow cleared = Number of times × Amount of snow cleared per pass
Amount of snow cleared = 3 × 170 cm
Amount of snow cleared = 510 cm

Step 3: Find the amount of snow left over after the final pass.
Amount of snow left over = Total snowfall - Amount of snow cleared
Amount of snow left over = 513 cm - 510 cm
Amount of snow left over = 3 cm

Therefore, after the final pass, 3 centimeters of snow will be left over.

        Suppose that instead of 513 centimeters, there were 460 centimeters of snowfall this winter. If the same snowplow, which can clear up to 170 centimeters of snow at a time, runs continuously, how many centimeters of snow would then be left over after the final pass?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times the snowplow can clear 170 centimeters of snow from the total snowfall of 460 centimeters.

Given information:
- Total snowfall = 460 centimeters
- The snowplow can clear up to 170 centimeters of snow at a time.

Step 1: Find the number of times the snowplow can clear 170 centimeters of snow.
Number of times = Total snowfall / Amount of snow cleared per pass
Number of times = 460 cm / 170 cm
Number of times = 2 (since we can't have a partial pass)

Step 2: Calculate the amount of snow cleared by the snowplow.
Amount of snow cleared = Number of times × Amount of snow cleared per pass
Amount of snow cleared = 2 × 170 cm
Amount of snow cleared = 340 cm

Step 3: Find the amount of snow left over after the final pass.
Amount of snow left over = Total snowfall - Amount of snow cleared
Amount of snow left over = 460 cm - 340 cm
Amount of snow left over = 120 cm

Therefore, with a total snowfall of 460 centimeters, and the same snowplow that can clear up to 170 centimeters of snow at a time, 120 centimeters of snow would be left over after the final pass.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many compasses the compass maker can make with the available needles, and then calculate the remaining needles.

Given information:
- The compass maker has 661 needles.
- Each compass requires 510 needles.

Step 1: Find the number of compasses the compass maker can make with the available needles.
Number of compasses = Total number of needles / Number of needles per compass
Number of compasses = 661 / 510
Number of compasses = 1 (since we can only make whole compasses)

Step 2: Calculate the number of needles used for making the compasses.
Number of needles used = Number of compasses × Number of needles per compass
Number of needles used = 1 × 510 = 510 needles

Step 3: Calculate the remaining needles.
Remaining needles = Total number of needles - Number of needles used
Remaining needles = 661 - 510 = 151 needles

Therefore, after installing as many full compasses as possible, the compass maker will have 151 needles left.

Given information:
- The furniture factory has manufactured 380 chairs.
- Each shop can hold a maximum of 310 chairs in its storage.

Step 1: Find the number of shops that can accommodate the chairs.
Number of chairs that can be accommodated by one shop = 310 chairs
Number of shops required = Total number of chairs / Number of chairs per shop
Number of shops required = 380 chairs / 310 chairs per shop
Number of shops required = 1.22580645161290... (rounded down to 1)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining chairs at the factory.
Total number of chairs - (Number of shops × Number of chairs per shop) = Remaining chairs at the factory
380 chairs - (1 × 310 chairs) = 70 chairs

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of smaller distributors that can accommodate the chairs and then calculate the remaining chairs at the factory.

Given information:
- The furniture factory has manufactured 380 chairs.
- Each smaller distributor can hold a maximum of 143 chairs.

Step 1: Find the number of smaller distributors that can accommodate the chairs.
Number of chairs that can be accommodated by one smaller distributor = 143 chairs
Number of smaller distributors required = Total number of chairs / Number of chairs per smaller distributor
Number of smaller distributors required = 380 chairs / 143 chairs per smaller distributor
Number of smaller distributors required = 2.65730337078652... (rounded down to 2)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining chairs at the factory.
Total number of chairs - (Number of smaller distributors × Number of chairs per smaller distributor) = Remaining chairs at the factory
380 chairs - (2 × 143 chairs) = 94 chairs

Therefore, 94 chairs will be left at the factory after evenly distributing the chairs to the smaller distributors.

Given information:
- The farmer has gathered 929 tomatoes.
- Each box can hold 154 tomatoes.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes the farmer can pack with 929 tomatoes.
Number of boxes = Total number of tomatoes / Number of tomatoes per box
Number of boxes = 929 / 154
Number of boxes = 6 (since we need to round down to the nearest whole number)

Step 2: Calculate the number of tomatoes packed in the boxes.
Number of tomatoes packed in boxes = Number of boxes × Number of tomatoes per box
Number of tomatoes packed in boxes = 6 × 154 = 924

Step 3: Calculate the number of tomatoes left over.
Number of tomatoes left over = Total number of tomatoes - Number of tomatoes packed in boxes
Number of tomatoes left over = 929 - 924 = 5

Therefore, after packing the tomatoes evenly in boxes, there will be 5 tomatoes left over.

Step 1: Find the number of larger boxes the farmer can pack with 929 tomatoes.
Number of larger boxes = Total number of tomatoes / Number of tomatoes per larger box
Number of larger boxes = 929 / 834
Number of larger boxes = 1 (since we need to round down to the nearest whole number)

Step 2: Calculate the number of tomatoes packed in the larger boxes.
Number of tomatoes packed in larger boxes = Number of larger boxes × Number of tomatoes per larger box
Number of tomatoes packed in larger boxes = 1 × 834 = 834

Step 3: Calculate the number of tomatoes left over.
Number of tomatoes left over = Total number of tomatoes - Number of tomatoes packed in larger boxes
Number of tomatoes left over = 929 - 834 = 95

Given information:
- The store has 454 pairs of ice skates in total.
- The store distributes the skates evenly among 128 boxes.

Step 1: Find the number of pairs of ice skates that can be evenly distributed among the boxes.
Number of pairs of ice skates per box = Total pairs of ice skates / Number of boxes
Number of pairs of ice skates per box = 454 / 128
Number of pairs of ice skates per box = 3.546875 (rounded down to 3)

Step 2: Find the number of pairs of ice skates that can be evenly distributed among the boxes.
Number of pairs of ice skates evenly distributed = Number of pairs of ice skates per box × Number of boxes
Number of pairs of ice skates evenly distributed = 3 × 128
Number of pairs of ice skates evenly distributed = 384

Step 3: Find the number of pairs of ice skates left over after all the boxes are filled up equally.
Number of pairs of ice skates left over = Total pairs of ice skates - Number of pairs of ice skates evenly distributed

Step 1: Find the number of pairs of ice skates that can be evenly distributed among the boxes.
Number of pairs of ice skates per box = Total pairs of ice skates / Number of boxes
Number of pairs of ice skates per box = 976 / 128
Number of pairs of ice skates per box = 7.625 (rounded down to 7)

Step 2: Find the number of pairs of ice skates that can be evenly distributed among the boxes.
Number of pairs of ice skates evenly distributed = Number of pairs of ice skates per box × Number of boxes
Number of pairs of ice skates evenly distributed = 7 × 128
Number of pairs of ice skates evenly distributed = 896

Step 3: Find the number of pairs of ice skates left over after all the boxes are filled up equally.
Number of pairs of ice skates left over = Total pairs of ice skates - Number of pairs of ice skates evenly distributed

Step 1: Divide the power generated by the windmill by the power consumed by the village in increments.
Power generated by the windmill / Power consumed by the village in increments = Number of full increments consumed + Remainder
506 units / 385 units = 1 full increment + Remainder

Step 2: Find the remainder.
Remainder = Power generated by the windmill - (Number of full increments consumed × Power consumed by the village in increments)
Remainder = 506 units - (1 × 385 units)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this scenario, we need to find the remainder when the power generated by the windmill (506 units) is divided by the new daily power consumption of the village (920 units).

Given information:
- The windmill generates 506 units of power per day.

Step 1: Divide the power generated by the windmill by the power consumed by the village in increments.
Power generated by the windmill / Power consumed by the village in increments = Number of full increments consumed + Remainder
506 units / 920 units = 0 full increments + Remainder

Step 2: Find the remainder.
Remainder = Power generated by the windmill - (Number of full increments consumed × Power consumed by the village in increments)
Remainder = 506 units - (0 × 920 units)

Step 1: Find the number of energy blasts Blast Man can fire.
Number of energy blasts = Total energy units / Energy units per blast
Number of energy blasts = 338 / 16
Number of energy blasts = 21.125 (rounded down to 21 since we cannot fire a partial blast)

Step 2: Calculate the energy units used for firing 21 blasts.
Energy units used = Number of blasts × Energy units per blast
Energy units used = 21 × 16
Energy units used = 336

Step 3: Calculate the remaining energy units in Blast Man's power cells.

Number of buses required = 3.68 (rounded down to 3 since we cannot have a fractional bus)

Step 2: Find the number of students that can be transported by the first 3 buses.
Number of students transported by the first 3 buses = 3 × 144 = 432

Step 3: Find the number of students remaining for the last bus.
Number of students remaining for the last bus = Total number of students - Number of students transported by the first 3 buses
Number of students remaining for the last bus = 530 - 432 = 98

Therefore, the last school bus will have 98 students.

Given information:
- The wizard has 999 spells in his book.
- There are 951 apprentice wizards.

Step 1: Find the number of spells each apprentice wizard will receive.
Number of spells per apprentice wizard = Total number of spells / Number of apprentice wizards
Number of spells per apprentice wizard = 999 / 951
Number of spells per apprentice wizard = 1 (integer division)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining spells after distributing them equally.
Remaining spells = Total number of spells - (Number of apprentice wizards × Number of spells per apprentice wizard)
Remaining spells = 999 - (951 × 1)
Remaining spells = 999 - 951
Remaining spells = 48

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many trucks are needed to carry all the scooters, and then calculate the remaining scooters after loading the trucks.

Given information:
- The company has produced 767 scooters.
- Each delivery truck can carry 369 scooters.

Step 1: Find the number of trucks needed to carry all the scooters.
Number of trucks needed = Total number of scooters / Number of scooters per truck
Number of trucks needed = 767 / 369
Number of trucks needed = 2.078 (rounded down to 2 since we can't have a fraction of a truck)

Step 2: Calculate the number of scooters that can be loaded onto the trucks.
Number of scooters loaded onto trucks = Number of trucks × Number of scooters per truck
Number of scooters loaded onto trucks = 2 × 369 = 738

Step 3: Calculate the remaining scooters after loading the trucks.
Remaining scooters = Total number of scooters - Number of scooters loaded onto trucks
Remaining scooters = 767 - 738 = 29

Therefore, after loading all the trucks, there will be 29 scooters left.

Given information:
- There are 846 water droplets in the cloud.
- Each raindrop needs 722 droplets to form.

Step 1: Find the maximum number of raindrops that can be formed.
Maximum number of raindrops = Total number of water droplets / Number of droplets needed for one raindrop
Maximum number of raindrops = 846 / 722
Maximum number of raindrops = 1 (since we cannot have a fractional number of raindrops)

Step 2: Calculate the number of droplets used to form the maximum number of raindrops.
Number of droplets used = Maximum number of raindrops × Number of droplets needed for one raindrop
Number of droplets used = 1 × 722 = 722

Step 3: Calculate the number of droplets left unconverted.
Number of droplets left unconverted = Total number of water droplets - Number of droplets used
Number of droplets left unconverted = 846 - 722 = 124

Maximum number of raindrops = 846 / 442
Maximum number of raindrops = 1 (since we cannot have a fractional number of raindrops)

Step 2: Calculate the number of droplets used to form the maximum number of raindrops.

Given information:
- There are 265 unicorns in Unicorn Village.
- The village is divided into 146 equal sections.

Step 1: Find the number of unicorns that can be equally distributed among the complete sections.
Number of complete sections = 146 - 1 = 145 (since there is one incomplete section)
Number of unicorns in each complete section = 265 ÷ 146 = 1 (integer division)
Number of unicorns in the complete sections = 145 × 1 = 145

Step 2: Find the number of unicorns in the last incomplete section.
Number of unicorns in the last incomplete section = Total unicorns - Number of unicorns in the complete sections
Number of unicorns in the last incomplete section = 265 - 145 = 120

Therefore, the last incomplete section will have 120 unicorns residing in it.

Step 1: Find the number of matches that can be filled with 923 players.
Number of matches = Total number of players / Number of players per match
Number of matches = 923 / 383
Number of matches = 2 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Calculate the number of players who can enter the matches.
Number of players who can enter matches = Number of matches × Number of players per match
Number of players who can enter matches = 2 × 383 = 766

Step 3: Calculate the number of players left waiting after filling all the matches.

Given information:
- The pirate ship has 923 cannonballs.
- The cannonballs need to be distributed among 499 crates.

Step 1: Find the number of cannonballs that can be evenly distributed among the crates.
Number of cannonballs per crate = Total cannonballs / Number of crates
Number of cannonballs per crate = 923 / 499
Number of cannonballs per crate = 1 (integer division)

Step 2: Find the number of cannonballs that can be evenly distributed among all crates.
Number of cannonballs evenly distributed = Number of cannonballs per crate × Number of crates
Number of cannonballs evenly distributed = 1 × 499
Number of cannonballs evenly distributed = 499

Step 3: Find the number of cannonballs left uncrated.
Number of cannonballs left uncrated = Total cannonballs - Number of cannonballs evenly distributed
Number of cannonballs left uncrated = 923 - 499

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow a similar approach as the previous problem and find the number of cannonballs that can be evenly distributed among the crates, and then check if there are any remaining cannonballs left uncrated.

Given information:
- The pirate ship has 462 cannonballs.
- The cannonballs need to be distributed among 499 crates.

Step 1: Find the number of cannonballs that can be evenly distributed among the crates.
Number of cannonballs per crate = Total cannonballs / Number of crates
Number of cannonballs per crate = 462 / 499
Number of cannonballs per crate = 0 (integer division)

Step 2: Find the number of cannonballs that can be evenly distributed among all crates.
Number of cannonballs evenly distributed = Number of cannonballs per crate × Number of crates
Number of cannonballs evenly distributed = 0 × 499
Number of cannonballs evenly distributed = 0

Step 3: Find the number of cannonballs left uncrated.
Number of cannonballs left uncrated = Total cannonballs - Number of cannonballs evenly distributed
Number of cannonballs left uncrated = 462 - 0
Number of cannonballs left uncrated = 462

Since the number of cannonballs per crate is 0 (after integer division), none of the cannonballs can be evenly distributed among the crates. Therefore, all 462 cannonballs will be left uncrated.

Step 1: Find the number of string spools distributed to the kites.
Number of string spools distributed = Number of kites
Number of string spools distributed = 518

Step 2: Find the number of string spools left in the store.
Number of string spools left = Total number of string spools - Number of string spools distributed
Number of string spools left = 530 - 518
Number of string spools left = 12

Step 1: Find the number of jugs that can be filled with the total milk produced.
Number of jugs that can be filled = Total milk produced / Capacity of each jug
Number of jugs that can be filled = 913 gallons / 39 gallons per jug
Number of jugs that can be filled = 23.41 jugs (rounded down to the nearest whole number)
Number of jugs that can be filled = 23 jugs

Step 2: Calculate the total milk that can be filled in the jugs.
Total milk that can be filled in the jugs = Number of jugs × Capacity of each jug
Total milk that can be filled in the jugs = 23 jugs × 39 gallons per jug
Total milk that can be filled in the jugs = 897 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the remaining milk after filling all the jugs.
Remaining milk = Total milk produced - Total milk that can be filled in the jugs

Step 1: Find the number of larger jugs that can be filled with the total milk produced.
Number of larger jugs that can be filled = Total milk produced / Capacity of each larger jug
Number of larger jugs that can be filled = 913 gallons / 230 gallons per jug
Number of larger jugs that can be filled = 3.97 jugs (rounded down to the nearest whole number)
Number of larger jugs that can be filled = 3 jugs

Step 2: Calculate the total milk that can be filled in the larger jugs.
Total milk that can be filled in the larger jugs = Number of larger jugs × Capacity of each larger jug
Total milk that can be filled in the larger jugs = 3 jugs × 230 gallons per jug
Total milk that can be filled in the larger jugs = 690 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the remaining milk after filling all the larger jugs.
Remaining milk = Total milk produced - Total milk that can be filled in the larger jugs

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many rows of dolls can be formed with 369 dolls in each row, and then calculate the remaining dolls that were left unarranged.

Given information:
- The doll seller received a shipment of 603 new dolls.
- Each row has 369 dolls.

Step 1: Find the number of rows that can be formed with 369 dolls in each row.
Number of rows = Total number of dolls / Number of dolls per row
Number of rows = 603 / 369
Number of rows = 1 (since 603 is less than 2 × 369)

Step 2: Calculate the number of dolls left unarranged.
Number of dolls left unarranged = Total number of dolls - (Number of rows × Number of dolls per row)
Number of dolls left unarranged = 603 - (1 × 369)
Number of dolls left unarranged = 603 - 369
Number of dolls left unarranged = 234

Therefore, 234 dolls were left unarranged after filling up the rows as much as possible.

Given information:
- The doll seller received a shipment of 44 new dolls.
- Each row has 369 dolls.

Step 1: Find the number of rows that can be formed with 369 dolls in each row.
Number of rows = Total number of dolls / Number of dolls per row
Number of rows = 44 / 369
Number of rows = 0 (since 44 is less than 369)

Step 2: Calculate the number of dolls left unarranged.
Number of dolls left unarranged = Total number of dolls - (Number of rows × Number of dolls per row)
Number of dolls left unarranged = 44 - (0 × 369)
Number of dolls left unarranged = 44

Therefore, all 44 dolls would be left unarranged after filling up the rows as much as possible, since there are not enough dolls to form even a single row of 369 dolls.

Given information:
- The jewelry maker has 850 beads.
- Each necklace requires 631 beads.

Step 1: Find the number of necklaces the jewelry maker can make with 850 beads.
Number of necklaces = Total beads / Beads required per necklace
Number of necklaces = 850 / 631
Number of necklaces = 1 (since we cannot make a fraction of a necklace)

Step 2: Calculate the number of beads used to make one necklace.
Beads used for one necklace = 631

Step 3: Calculate the remaining beads after making one necklace.
Remaining beads = Total beads - Beads used for one necklace
Remaining beads = 850 - 631
Remaining beads = 219

Therefore, after using as many beads as possible to make necklaces, the jewelry maker will have 219 beads left over.

- Each necklace requires 150 beads with the new design.

Step 1: Find the number of necklaces the jewelry maker can make with 850 beads.
Number of necklaces = Total beads / Beads required per necklace
Number of necklaces = 850 / 150
Number of necklaces = 5 (since we cannot make a fraction of a necklace)

Step 2: Calculate the number of beads used to make 5 necklaces.
Beads used for 5 necklaces = 5 × 150 = 750

Step 3: Calculate the remaining beads after making 5 necklaces.
Remaining beads = Total beads - Beads used for 5 necklaces
Remaining beads = 850 - 750

Given information:
- The gardener has 952 grapes.
- Each box can hold 380 grapes.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes the gardener can fill.
Number of boxes = Total number of grapes / Number of grapes per box
Number of boxes = 952 / 380
Number of boxes = 2.5 (rounded down to the nearest whole number, which is 2)

Step 2: Calculate the number of grapes used to fill the boxes.
Number of grapes used = Number of boxes × Number of grapes per box
Number of grapes used = 2 × 380 = 760

Step 3: Calculate the remaining grapes.
Remaining grapes = Total number of grapes - Number of grapes used
Remaining grapes = 952 - 760 = 192

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of grapes the gardener has after receiving the additional grapes from his friend, and then calculate the remaining grapes after packaging them into boxes.

Given information:
- The gardener initially had 192 grapes remaining after packaging the first batch of grapes.
- The gardener's friend gave him an additional 183 grapes.
- Each box can hold 380 grapes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of grapes the gardener has now.
Total number of grapes = Initial remaining grapes + Additional grapes
Total number of grapes = 192 + 183 = 375

Step 2: Find the number of boxes the gardener can fill with the total number of grapes.
Number of boxes = Total number of grapes / Number of grapes per box
Number of boxes = 375 / 380
Number of boxes = 0.98 (rounded down to the nearest whole number, which is 0)

Step 3: Calculate the remaining grapes after packaging the new grapes into boxes.

Given information:
- There are 236 steps mentioned on the guide.
- Every 44 steps lead to a significant place or clue.

Step 1: Find the number of significant places or clues.
Number of significant places or clues = Total steps / Steps per significant place or clue
Number of significant places or clues = 236 / 44
Number of significant places or clues = 5.36 (rounded down to 5)

Step 2: Find the total number of steps taken to reach the last significant place or clue.
Total steps taken = Number of significant places or clues × Steps per significant place or clue
Total steps taken = 5 × 44
Total steps taken = 220 steps

Given information:
- Sarah blew 932 bubbles.
- The bubble machine forms groups of 507 bubbles each before releasing them.

Step 1: Find the number of complete groups of 507 bubbles.
Number of complete groups = Total bubbles / Bubbles per group
Number of complete groups = 932 / 507
Number of complete groups = 1 (since 932 / 507 = 1.84, we take the integer part)

Step 2: Calculate the number of bubbles in the remaining incomplete group.
Number of bubbles in the incomplete group = Total bubbles - (Number of complete groups × Bubbles per group)
Number of bubbles in the incomplete group = 932 - (1 × 507)
Number of bubbles in the incomplete group = 425

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total capacity of the swing sets and then subtract it from the total number of kids who want to use the swings.

Given information:
- There are 931 kids who want to use the swings.
- Each swing set can accommodate 34 kids at a time.

Step 1: Find the total capacity of the swing sets.
Let's assume there are x swing sets.
Total capacity of the swing sets = x × 34 kids

Since all the swing sets are filled continuously, the total capacity should be equal to or greater than the total number of kids.
931 ≤ x × 34
x ≥ 931 / 34
x ≥ 27.38 (rounded up to the nearest whole number)
x = 28 swing sets

Total capacity of the swing sets = 28 × 34 = 952 kids

Step 2: Find the number of kids waiting for their turn after all the swing sets are occupied.
Number of kids waiting = Total number of kids - Total capacity of the swing sets
Number of kids waiting = 931 - 952 = -21

Since the number of kids waiting cannot be negative, it means that all the kids can be accommodated in the swing sets, and there will be no kids waiting for their turn.

Therefore, the number of kids waiting for their turn after all the swing sets are occupied is 0.

Given information:
- The gardener has 982 flowers to plant.

Number of flowerbeds = 982 / 555
Number of flowerbeds = 1 (since we cannot have a fractional number of flowerbeds)

Step 2: Calculate the number of flowers used to fill the flowerbeds.
Number of flowers used = Number of flowerbeds × Number of flowers per flowerbed
Number of flowers used = 1 × 555 = 555 flowers

Step 3: Calculate the remaining flowers.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many flowerbeds the gardener can fill with the new total number of flowers, and then calculate the remaining flowers.

Given information:
- The gardener now has 867 flowers to plant.
- Each flowerbed can fit 555 flowers.

Step 1: Find the number of flowerbeds the gardener can fill.
Number of flowerbeds = Total number of flowers / Number of flowers per flowerbed
Number of flowerbeds = 867 / 555
Number of flowerbeds = 1 (since we cannot have a fractional number of flowerbeds)

Step 2: Calculate the number of flowers used to fill the flowerbeds.
Number of flowers used = Number of flowerbeds × Number of flowers per flowerbed
Number of flowers used = 1 × 555 = 555 flowers

Step 3: Calculate the remaining flowers.
Remaining flowers = Total number of flowers - Number of flowers used
Remaining flowers = 867 - 555 = 312 flowers

Therefore, after filling up as many flowerbeds as possible with the new total of 867 flowers, the gardener will have 312 flowers left to plant.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the remainder when 203 is divided by 5.

Given information:
- The farmer has 203 strawberry plants.
- The farmer wants to divide the plants into groups of 5.

Step 1: Divide 203 by 5 to find the number of groups of 5 plants.
203 ÷ 5 = 40 (with a remainder of 3)

Step 2: Find the number of plants that can be divided into groups of 5.
Number of plants in groups of 5 = 40 × 5 = 200

Step 3: Find the number of remaining plants.
Number of remaining plants = Total plants - Number of plants in groups of 5
Number of remaining plants = 203 - 200 = 3

Therefore, if the farmer divides the 203 strawberry plants into groups of 5, there will be 3 plants remaining.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the remainder when the total number of strawberry plants (203 + 76 = 279) is divided by 5.

Given information:
- The farmer initially had 203 strawberry plants.
- The farmer harvested an additional 76 strawberry plants.
- The farmer wants to divide the total number of plants into groups of 5.

Step 1: Find the total number of strawberry plants.
Total number of plants = Initial plants + Additional plants
Total number of plants = 203 + 76 = 279

Step 2: Divide the total number of plants by 5 to find the number of groups of 5 plants.
279 ÷ 5 = 55 (with a remainder of 4)

Step 3: Find the number of plants that can be divided into groups of 5.
Number of plants in groups of 5 = 55 × 5 = 275

Step 4: Find the number of remaining plants.
Number of remaining plants = Total plants - Number of plants in groups of 5
Number of remaining plants = 279 - 275 = 4

Therefore, if the farmer divides the total of 279 strawberry plants into groups of 5, there will be 4 plants remaining.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bundles of 16 carrots the gardener can make with the 355 carrots, and then calculate the remaining carrots.

Given information:
- The gardener has 355 carrots.
- Each bundle contains 16 carrots.

Step 1: Find the number of bundles the gardener can make with 355 carrots.
Number of bundles = Total number of carrots / Number of carrots per bundle
Number of bundles = 355 / 16
Number of bundles = 22 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Calculate the number of carrots used to make the bundles.
Number of carrots used for bundles = Number of bundles × Number of carrots per bundle
Number of carrots used for bundles = 22 × 16
Number of carrots used for bundles = 352

Step 3: Calculate the remaining carrots.
Remaining carrots = Total number of carrots - Number of carrots used for bundles
Remaining carrots = 355 - 352
Remaining carrots = 3

Therefore, after creating as many bundles of 16 carrots as possible, the gardener will have 3 carrots left.

        A total rainfall of 612 inches fell over a certain city in 29 consecutive days. If the rain fell in the same amount every day, how many inches of rain would be left to make the days evenly rainy?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the average rainfall per day and then calculate the difference between the average rainfall and the actual rainfall on each day.

Given information:
- Total rainfall = 612 inches
- Number of consecutive days = 29 days

Step 1: Find the average rainfall per day.
Average rainfall per day = Total rainfall / Number of days
Average rainfall per day = 612 inches / 29 days
Average rainfall per day = 21 inches

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the average rainfall and the actual rainfall on each day.
Difference = Average rainfall per day - Actual rainfall on each day

Since we don't have the actual rainfall data for each day, we can assume that the difference is the same for all days.

Let's represent the difference as x.

Total difference = 29x (since there are 29 days)

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the value of x.
Total difference = Total rainfall - (29 × Average rainfall per day)
29x = 612 - (29 × 21)
29x = 612 - 609
29x = 3
x = 3/29
x ≈ 0.103 inches

Therefore, to make the days evenly rainy, approximately 0.103 inches of rain would be left to distribute among the days.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many trucks are required to transport all the boxes, and then calculate the remaining boxes after loading the trucks to their full capacity.

Given information:
- The truck company has 514 boxes for delivery.
- Each truck can hold up to 371 boxes.

Step 1: Find the number of trucks required to transport all the boxes.
Number of trucks required = Total number of boxes / Capacity of each truck
Number of trucks required = 514 / 371
Number of trucks required = 1.38 (rounded up to 2 trucks)

Step 2: Calculate the total number of boxes that can be loaded onto the trucks.
Total boxes that can be loaded = Number of trucks × Capacity of each truck
Total boxes that can be loaded = 2 × 371 = 742 boxes

Step 3: Calculate the remaining boxes after loading the trucks to their full capacity.
Remaining boxes = Total number of boxes - Total boxes that can be loaded
Remaining boxes = 514 - 742 = -228 boxes

Since the result is negative, it means that all the boxes can be loaded onto the trucks, and there will be no remaining boxes.

Therefore, the number of boxes left over is 0.

Step 1: Divide 684 by 230 to find the number of complete sets.
684 ÷ 230 = 2 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Find the number of sandcastles in the complete sets.
Number of sandcastles in complete sets = 2 × 230 = 460

Step 3: Find the number of sandcastles left that didn't form a complete set.
Number of sandcastles left = Total sandcastles - Number of sandcastles in complete sets

Given information:
- Total number of toy cars = 735

Step 1: Find the number of full packs that can be made.
Number of full packs = Total number of toy cars / Number of toy cars per pack
Number of full packs = 735 / 348
Number of full packs = 2 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Calculate the number of toy cars used for the full packs.
Number of toy cars used for full packs = Number of full packs × Number of toy cars per pack
Number of toy cars used for full packs = 2 × 348 = 696

Step 3: Calculate the number of toy cars left over.
Number of toy cars left over = Total number of toy cars - Number of toy cars used for full packs
Number of toy cars left over = 735 - 696 = 39

Number of territories required = Total number of animals / Number of animals per territory
Number of territories required = 386 / 95
Number of territories required = 4.06 (rounded down to 4 since we cannot have a partial territory)

Step 2: Calculate the number of animals that can be accommodated in the fully occupied territories.
Number of animals in fully occupied territories = Number of fully occupied territories × Number of animals per territory
Number of animals in fully occupied territories = 4 × 95 = 380

Step 3: Calculate the remaining animals in the last not fully occupied territory.
Remaining animals in the last territory = Total number of animals - Number of animals in fully occupied territories

- Length of each piece to be cut = 902 meters.

Step 1: Find the number of pieces of 902 meters that can be cut from the 934-meter rope.
Number of pieces = Total length of the rope / Length of each piece
Number of pieces = 934 meters / 902 meters
Number of pieces = 1.035 (rounded down to 1)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining length of the rope after cutting the maximum possible number of pieces.
Remaining length of the rope = Total length of the rope - (Number of pieces × Length of each piece)
Remaining length of the rope = 934 meters - (1 × 902 meters)
Remaining length of the rope = 32 meters

        Continuing from the previous scenario, suppose that the manufacturer only made a rope of 202 meters in length initially. Applying the same method of cutting rope into pieces that are each 902 meters long, how many meters would the piece of the rope be now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this scenario, the total length of the rope is 202 meters, and the length of each piece to be cut is still 902 meters.

Given information:
- Total length of the rope = 202 meters.
- Length of each piece to be cut = 902 meters.

Step 1: Find the number of pieces of 902 meters that can be cut from the 202-meter rope.
Number of pieces = Total length of the rope / Length of each piece
Number of pieces = 202 meters / 902 meters
Number of pieces = 0.224 (rounded down to 0)

Since the number of pieces is rounded down to 0, it means that no complete piece of 902 meters can be cut from the 202-meter rope.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining length of the rope, which is the entire rope itself.
Remaining length of the rope = Total length of the rope
Remaining length of the rope = 202 meters

Therefore, if the manufacturer made a rope of 202 meters in length and tried to cut it into pieces of 902 meters each, the entire rope would remain uncut, and the length of the piece would be 202 meters.

        A dairy farm produces 561 liters of milk each day. The milk is packaged into 550-liter containers. How many liters of milk are left over each day after filling the containers?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the remainder after dividing the total milk production by the container size.

Given information:
- The dairy farm produces 561 liters of milk each day.
- The milk is packaged into 550-liter containers.

Step 1: Divide the total milk production by the container size.
Total milk production / Container size = Number of containers filled
561 liters / 550 liters = 1.02 containers

Step 2: Find the number of liters that can be filled into whole containers.
Number of whole containers × Container size = Liters filled into whole containers
1 container × 550 liters = 550 liters

Step 3: Find the remaining liters of milk after filling the whole containers.
Total milk production - Liters filled into whole containers = Remaining liters
561 liters - 550 liters = 11 liters

Therefore, 11 liters of milk are left over each day after filling the containers.

        If the dairy farm increased its production and started producing 729 liters of milk each day instead of 561 liters, how many liters of milk would be left over each day after filling the 550-liter containers?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the remainder after dividing the new total milk production by the container size.

Given information:
- The dairy farm now produces 729 liters of milk each day.
- The milk is still packaged into 550-liter containers.

Step 1: Divide the new total milk production by the container size.
New total milk production / Container size = Number of containers filled
729 liters / 550 liters = 1.325 containers

Step 2: Find the number of liters that can be filled into whole containers.
Number of whole containers × Container size = Liters filled into whole containers
1 container × 550 liters = 550 liters

Step 3: Find the remaining liters of milk after filling the whole containers.
New total milk production - Liters filled into whole containers = Remaining liters
729 liters - 550 liters = 179 liters

Therefore, with the increased production of 729 liters of milk each day, 179 liters of milk would be left over each day after filling the 550-liter containers.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given:
- Jon has 259 puzzle pieces.
- Each puzzle requires 542 pieces.

Step 1: Find how many full puzzles Jon can make with his 259 pieces.
259 ÷ 542 = 0 (with a remainder of 259)

This means Jon cannot make any full puzzles with his 259 pieces when each puzzle requires 542 pieces.

Step 2: Since Jon cannot make any full puzzles, all 259 pieces will be left over.

Therefore, after attempting to make as many full puzzles as possible with his 259 pieces, Jon will have 259 pieces left over.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many bracelets the jewelry maker can create with the available beads, and then calculate the remaining beads.

Given information:
- The jewelry maker has 673 beads.
- Each bracelet requires 49 beads.

Step 1: Find the number of bracelets the jewelry maker can create with the available beads.
Number of bracelets = Total number of beads / Number of beads per bracelet
Number of bracelets = 673 / 49
Number of bracelets = 13 (since we need to use an exact number of beads for each bracelet)

Step 2: Calculate the number of beads used for creating the bracelets.
Number of beads used = Number of bracelets × Number of beads per bracelet
Number of beads used = 13 × 49
Number of beads used = 637

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining beads.
Number of remaining beads = Total number of beads - Number of beads used
Number of remaining beads = 673 - 637
Number of remaining beads = 36

Given information:
- The jewelry maker has 673 beads in total.
- Each large bracelet requires 545 beads.

Step 1: Find the number of large bracelets the jewelry maker can create with the available beads.
Number of large bracelets = Total number of beads / Number of beads per large bracelet
Number of large bracelets = 673 / 545
Number of large bracelets = 1 (since we need to use an exact number of beads for each bracelet)

Step 2: Calculate the number of beads used for creating the large bracelets.
Number of beads used = Number of large bracelets × Number of beads per large bracelet
Number of beads used = 1 × 545
Number of beads used = 545

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining beads.

Given information:
- The police station received 927 calls within a week.
- There are 311 operators.

Step 1: Divide the total number of calls by the number of operators to find the number of calls each operator would handle if the calls were divided equally.
Number of calls per operator = Total number of calls / Number of operators
Number of calls per operator = 927 / 311
Number of calls per operator = 2 (integer division)

Step 2: Find the remainder after dividing the total number of calls by the number of operators.

Step 1: Find the number of full packages John can make.
Number of full packages = Total pieces / Pieces per package
Number of full packages = 764 / 589
Number of full packages = 1 (since we need to consider only full packages)

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces used in the full packages.
Pieces used in full packages = Number of full packages × Pieces per package
Pieces used in full packages = 1 × 589 = 589 pieces

Step 1: Find the number of full packages John can make.
Number of full packages = Total pieces / Pieces per package
Number of full packages = 404 / 589
Number of full packages = 0 (since we need to consider only full packages)

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces used in the full packages.
Pieces used in full packages = Number of full packages × Pieces per package
Pieces used in full packages = 0 × 589 = 0 pieces

Number of campsites = 639 / 374
Number of campsites = 1 (since we cannot have a fraction of a campsite)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining sleeping bags.
Remaining sleeping bags = Total number of sleeping bags - (Number of campsites × Number of sleeping bags per campsite)
Remaining sleeping bags = 639 - (1 × 374)
Remaining sleeping bags = 639 - 374
Remaining sleeping bags = 265

        The same company from our previous question receives an updated request for sleeping bags. Now instead of 639, they only need to donate 613. If each campsite is still supplied with 374 sleeping bags, how many sleeping bags will be left after all the campsites are filled?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of campsites that can be supplied with the available sleeping bags, and then calculate the remaining sleeping bags.

Given information:
- The company donates 613 sleeping bags.
- Each campsite is supplied with 374 sleeping bags.

Step 1: Find the number of campsites that can be supplied with the available sleeping bags.
Number of campsites = Total number of sleeping bags / Number of sleeping bags per campsite
Number of campsites = 613 / 374
Number of campsites = 1 (since we cannot have a fraction of a campsite)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining sleeping bags.
Remaining sleeping bags = Total number of sleeping bags - (Number of campsites × Number of sleeping bags per campsite)
Remaining sleeping bags = 613 - (1 × 374)
Remaining sleeping bags = 613 - 374
Remaining sleeping bags = 239

Therefore, there will be 239 sleeping bags left after supplying one campsite with 374 sleeping bags.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boxes required to pack all the pizzas and then calculate the remaining pizzas that don't fit into a box.

Given information:
- The pizza restaurant made 620 pizzas today.
- Each box can hold 8 pizzas.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes required to pack all the pizzas.
Number of boxes required = Total number of pizzas / Number of pizzas per box
Number of boxes required = 620 / 8
Number of boxes required = 77.5

Since we cannot have a fractional number of boxes, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
Number of boxes required = 78 boxes

Step 2: Calculate the number of pizzas that can be packed into the boxes.
Number of pizzas packed = Number of boxes × Number of pizzas per box
Number of pizzas packed = 78 × 8
Number of pizzas packed = 624 pizzas

Step 3: Calculate the number of pizzas left over that don't fit into a box.
Number of pizzas left over = Total number of pizzas - Number of pizzas packed
Number of pizzas left over = 620 - 624
Number of pizzas left over = -4

Since the number of pizzas left over is negative, it means that all the pizzas can be packed into the boxes, and there are no pizzas left over.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of storage units required to store all the robots and then calculate the remaining robots that won't fit in the storage units.

Given information:
- The factory made a total of 820 robots.
- Each storage unit can store 684 robots.

Step 1: Find the number of storage units required to store all the robots.
Number of storage units required = Total number of robots / Number of robots per storage unit
Number of storage units required = 820 / 684
Number of storage units required = 1.2 (rounded down to 1)

Step 2: Calculate the number of robots that can be stored in the storage units.
Number of robots that can be stored = Number of storage units × Number of robots per storage unit
Number of robots that can be stored = 1 × 684 = 684

Step 3: Calculate the number of robots that won't fit in the storage units.
Number of robots that won't fit = Total number of robots - Number of robots that can be stored
Number of robots that won't fit = 820 - 684 = 136

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of storage units required to store all the upgraded robots and then calculate the remaining robots that won't fit in the storage units.

Given information:
- The factory made a total of 820 upgraded robots.
- Each storage unit can store 625 upgraded robots.

Step 1: Find the number of storage units required to store all the upgraded robots.
Number of storage units required = Total number of upgraded robots / Number of upgraded robots per storage unit
Number of storage units required = 820 / 625
Number of storage units required = 1.312 (rounded up to 2)

Step 2: Calculate the number of upgraded robots that can be stored in the storage units.
Number of upgraded robots that can be stored = Number of storage units × Number of upgraded robots per storage unit
Number of upgraded robots that can be stored = 2 × 625 = 1250

Step 3: Calculate the number of upgraded robots that won't fit in the storage units.
Number of upgraded robots that won't fit = Total number of upgraded robots - Number of upgraded robots that can be stored
Number of upgraded robots that won't fit = 820 - 1250 = -430

Since the result is negative, it means that all the upgraded robots can be stored in the storage units, and there will be no upgraded robots remaining outside.

Therefore, no upgraded robots will remain outside of the storage units.

Given information:
- Initially, there are 516 droplets in the cloud.
- The cloud loses water droplets at an equal rate.
- The cloud becomes entirely dry after every 289 droplets.

Step 1: Find the number of complete cycles the cloud goes through.
Number of complete cycles = Total droplets / Droplets lost per cycle
Number of complete cycles = 516 / 289
Number of complete cycles = 1 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining droplets after the last cycle.
Remaining droplets = Total droplets - (Number of complete cycles × Droplets lost per cycle)

Given information:
- There are 330 boxes to be loaded.
- Each truck can hold exactly 4 boxes.

Step 1: Find the number of trucks needed to transport all the boxes.
Number of trucks needed = Total number of boxes / Number of boxes per truck
Number of trucks needed = 330 / 4
Number of trucks needed = 82.5

Since we cannot have a fractional number of trucks, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
Number of trucks needed = 83 trucks

Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes that can be loaded into the trucks.
Number of boxes that can be loaded = Number of trucks × Number of boxes per truck
Number of boxes that can be loaded = 83 × 4
Number of boxes that can be loaded = 332 boxes

Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes that will be left unloaded.
Number of boxes left unloaded = Total number of boxes - Number of boxes that can be loaded
Number of boxes left unloaded = 330 - 332
Number of boxes left unloaded = -2

Since we cannot have a negative number of boxes left unloaded, it means that all the boxes can be loaded into the trucks, and there will be no boxes left unloaded.

Step 1: Find the number of crates the farmer can fill with 649 potatoes.
Number of crates = Total potatoes / Potatoes per crate
Number of crates = 649 / 183
Number of crates = 3.54 (rounded down to 3 since we can't have a partial crate)

Step 2: Calculate the number of potatoes that can be packed into the crates.
Potatoes packed in crates = Number of crates × Potatoes per crate
Potatoes packed in crates = 3 × 183 = 549

Given information:
- There are 995 gold coins.

Step 1: Find the number of gold coins each pirate will receive when divided evenly.
Number of gold coins per pirate = Total gold coins / Number of pirates
Number of gold coins per pirate = 995 / 267
Number of gold coins per pirate = 3 (quotient)

Step 2: Find the number of gold coins left over after the even distribution.
Number of gold coins left over = Total gold coins - (Number of pirates × Number of gold coins per pirate)
Number of gold coins left over = 995 - (267 × 3)
Number of gold coins left over = 995 - 801

776 ÷ 18 = 43 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Find the number of snails in the remaining incomplete bunch.
Number of snails in the remaining incomplete bunch = 776 - (43 × 18)
Number of snails in the remaining incomplete bunch = 776 - 774

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of full boxes that can be packed and then subtract the total number of pillows packed in those boxes from the total number of pillows produced.

Given information:
- The factory produces 589 pillows per day.
- Each box holds 198 pillows.

Step 1: Find the number of full boxes that can be packed.
Number of full boxes = Total pillows produced / Pillows per box
Number of full boxes = 589 / 198
Number of full boxes = 2 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Find the total number of pillows packed in the full boxes.
Total pillows packed in full boxes = Number of full boxes × Pillows per box
Total pillows packed in full boxes = 2 × 198
Total pillows packed in full boxes = 396

Step 3: Find the number of pillows left outside the boxes.
Pillows left outside the boxes = Total pillows produced - Total pillows packed in full boxes
Pillows left outside the boxes = 589 - 396
Pillows left outside the boxes = 193

Therefore, 193 pillows will be left outside the boxes at the end of the day.

Given information:
- The factory produces 589 pillows per day.
- Each new box holds 810 pillows.

Step 1: Find the number of full boxes that can be packed.
Number of full boxes = Total pillows produced / Pillows per box
Number of full boxes = 589 / 810
Number of full boxes = 0 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Find the total number of pillows packed in the full boxes.
Total pillows packed in full boxes = Number of full boxes × Pillows per box
Total pillows packed in full boxes = 0 × 810
Total pillows packed in full boxes = 0

Given information:
- The jewelry maker has 633 beads.
- Each necklace requires 30 beads.

Step 1: Find the number of necklaces the jewelry maker can make.
Number of necklaces = Total number of beads / Number of beads per necklace
Number of necklaces = 633 / 30
Number of necklaces = 21

Step 2: Calculate the number of beads used for making necklaces.
Number of beads used = Number of necklaces × Number of beads per necklace
Number of beads used = 21 × 30
Number of beads used = 630

Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining beads.
Number of remaining beads = Total number of beads - Number of beads used
Number of remaining beads = 633 - 630

        John has collected 365 coins. He decided to put equal numbers of them in his 140 wallets. However, he found out he would still have some coins left after evenly distributing them into these wallets. How many coins will John have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of coins that can be evenly distributed among the 140 wallets, and then subtract that number from the total number of coins John has.

Given information:
- John has 365 coins.
- John has 140 wallets.

Step 1: Find the greatest number that divides both 365 and 140.
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 365 and 140 is 5.

Step 2: Divide 365 by the GCD to find the maximum number of coins that can be evenly distributed among the wallets.
365 ÷ 5 = 73

Step 3: Subtract the maximum number of coins that can be evenly distributed from the total number of coins.
365 - (73 × 140) = 365 - 10,220 = -9,855

Since the result is negative, it means that John cannot evenly distribute all the coins among the wallets.

Step 4: Find the number of coins left by taking the remainder of 365 divided by 140.
365 ÷ 140 = 2 with a remainder of 85

Therefore, John will have 85 coins left after evenly distributing the coins among the 140 wallets.

Step 1: Find the greatest number that divides both 739 and 140.
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 739 and 140 is 7.

Step 2: Divide 739 by the GCD to find the maximum number of coins that can be evenly distributed among the wallets.
739 ÷ 7 = 105

Step 3: Multiply the maximum number of coins that can be evenly distributed by the number of wallets.
105 × 140 = 14,700

Step 4: Find the number of coins left by taking the remainder of 739 divided by 140.
739 ÷ 140 = 5 with a remainder of 39

Given information:
- Total number of socks produced = 743
- Number of socks per carton = 451

Step 1: Find the number of cartons that can be filled.
Number of cartons = Total number of socks / Number of socks per carton
Number of cartons = 743 / 451
Number of cartons = 1 (since we cannot have a fractional number of cartons)

Step 2: Calculate the number of socks packed in the cartons.
Number of socks packed = Number of cartons × Number of socks per carton
Number of socks packed = 1 × 451 = 451

Step 3: Calculate the number of unpacked socks.
Number of unpacked socks = Total number of socks - Number of socks packed
Number of unpacked socks = 743 - 451 = 292

Step 1: Find the number of cartons that can be filled.
Number of cartons = Total number of socks / Number of socks per carton
Number of cartons = 743 / 179
Number of cartons = 4 (since we cannot have a fractional number of cartons)

Step 2: Calculate the number of socks packed in the cartons.
Number of socks packed = Number of cartons × Number of socks per carton
Number of socks packed = 4 × 179 = 716

Step 3: Calculate the number of unpacked socks.
Number of unpacked socks = Total number of socks - Number of socks packed

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the total number of children and the number of children who can go down the slide without rest.

Given information:
- Total number of children = 923
- Number of children who can go down the slide without rest = 771

Step 1: Find the number of children who will be left waiting for their turn.
Number of children left waiting = Total number of children - Number of children who can go down the slide without rest
Number of children left waiting = 923 - 771
Number of children left waiting = 152

Therefore, 152 children will be left waiting for their turn to slide down the slide.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* Initially, there were 923 children waiting to go down the slide
* 771 children went down the slide
* This left 923 - 771 = 152 children waiting
* Then another wave of children arrived, bringing the total back up to 923 children waiting
* Now, 881 children can go down the slide without any break

To find how many children will be left waiting after the 881 children go down, we need to subtract 881 from the total 923 children:

923 - 881 = 42

Given information:
- There are 442 people in the collapsing building.
- Iron Punch can teleport a maximum of 104 people at a time.

Step 1: Find the number of full groups of 104 people that Iron Punch can teleport.
Number of full groups = Total people / Maximum people per group
Number of full groups = 442 / 104
Number of full groups = 4 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Calculate the number of people teleported in the full groups.
Number of people teleported in full groups = Number of full groups × Maximum people per group
Number of people teleported in full groups = 4 × 104
Number of people teleported in full groups = 416

Step 3: Calculate the remaining people left in the building.
Remaining people = Total people - Number of people teleported in full groups

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boxes that can be filled with 719 erasers each, and then calculate the remaining erasers.

Given information:
- The stationery store received 842 erasers.
- Each box can hold 719 erasers.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes that can be filled with 719 erasers each.
Number of boxes = Total number of erasers / Number of erasers per box
Number of boxes = 842 / 719
Number of boxes = 1 (since we cannot have a fractional number of boxes)

Step 2: Calculate the number of erasers that can be placed in the boxes.
Number of erasers in the boxes = Number of boxes × Number of erasers per box
Number of erasers in the boxes = 1 × 719 = 719

Step 3: Calculate the number of erasers left over.
Number of erasers left over = Total number of erasers - Number of erasers in the boxes
Number of erasers left over = 842 - 719 = 123

Therefore, after filling as many boxes as possible with 719 erasers each, there will be 123 erasers left over.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boxes that can be filled with 420 erasers each, and then calculate the remaining erasers.

Given information:
- The stationery store received 842 erasers.
- Each box can hold 420 erasers.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes that can be filled with 420 erasers each.
Number of boxes = Total number of erasers / Number of erasers per box
Number of boxes = 842 / 420
Number of boxes = 2 (since we cannot have a fractional number of boxes)

Step 2: Calculate the number of erasers that can be placed in the boxes.
Number of erasers in the boxes = Number of boxes × Number of erasers per box
Number of erasers in the boxes = 2 × 420 = 840

Step 3: Calculate the number of erasers left over.
Number of erasers left over = Total number of erasers - Number of erasers in the boxes
Number of erasers left over = 842 - 840 = 2

Therefore, after filling as many boxes as possible with 420 erasers each, there will be 2 erasers left over.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many full boxes the farmer can pack with the 461 carrots, and then calculate the remaining carrots that will be left unpacked.

Given information:
- The farmer harvested 461 carrots.
- Each box can hold up to 244 carrots.

Step 1: Find the number of full boxes the farmer can pack.
Number of full boxes = Total carrots / Carrots per box
Number of full boxes = 461 / 244
Number of full boxes = 1 (with a remainder of 217)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining carrots that will be left unpacked.
Remaining carrots = Total carrots - (Number of full boxes × Carrots per box)
Remaining carrots = 461 - (1 × 244)
Remaining carrots = 461 - 244
Remaining carrots = 217

Therefore, after packing as many full boxes as possible, there will be 217 carrots left unpacked.

Given information:
- The farmer harvested 11 carrots.
- Each box can hold up to 244 carrots.

Step 1: Find the number of full boxes the farmer can pack.
Number of full boxes = Total carrots / Carrots per box
Number of full boxes = 11 / 244
Number of full boxes = 0 (since 11 is less than 244)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining carrots that will be left unpacked.
Remaining carrots = Total carrots - (Number of full boxes × Carrots per box)
Remaining carrots = 11 - (0 × 244)
Remaining carrots = 11

Since the farmer cannot pack any full boxes with only 11 carrots, all 11 carrots will be left unpacked.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the remainder when 309 is divided by 293.

Given information:
- There are 309 penguins in the colony.
- The penguin scientist wants to tag them in groups of 293.

Step 1: Divide 309 by 293 to find the number of complete groups.
309 ÷ 293 = 1 (with a remainder)

Step 2: Find the remainder by subtracting the product of the number of complete groups and the group size from the total number of penguins.
Remainder = 309 - (1 × 293)
Remainder = 309 - 293
Remainder = 16

Therefore, the final, possibly incomplete, group will have 16 penguins.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many batches of sandwiches can be made with the available 580 slices of bread, and then calculate the remaining slices after using up the bread for those batches.

Given information:
- The sandwich shop has 580 slices of bread.
- Each sandwich-making batch requires 18 slices of bread.

Step 1: Find the number of batches that can be made with 580 slices of bread.
Number of batches = Total slices of bread / Slices required per batch
Number of batches = 580 / 18
Number of batches = 32.22 (rounded down to 32 since we cannot have a partial batch)

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices of bread used for 32 batches.
Slices of bread used = Number of batches × Slices required per batch
Slices of bread used = 32 × 18
Slices of bread used = 576

Step 3: Calculate the remaining slices of bread after using up the bread for the batches.
Remaining slices of bread = Total slices of bread - Slices of bread used
Remaining slices of bread = 580 - 576
Remaining slices of bread = 4

Therefore, after using up the bread in these batches, the sandwich shop will have 4 slices of bread left.

- Each sandwich-making batch requires 477 slices of bread.

Step 1: Find the number of batches that can be made with 580 slices of bread.
Number of batches = Total slices of bread / Slices required per batch
Number of batches = 580 / 477
Number of batches = 1.21 (rounded down to 1 since we cannot have a partial batch)

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices of bread used for 1 batch.
Slices of bread used = Number of batches × Slices required per batch
Slices of bread used = 1 × 477
Slices of bread used = 477

Step 3: Calculate the remaining slices of bread after using up the bread for the batch.
Remaining slices of bread = Total slices of bread - Slices of bread used
Remaining slices of bread = 580 - 477

Given information:
- The tailor has 925 meters of fabric.
- The tailor uses 529 meters of fabric to make each dress.

Step 1: Find the number of dresses the tailor can make with the available fabric.
Number of dresses = Total fabric / Fabric required for one dress
Number of dresses = 925 meters / 529 meters per dress
Number of dresses = 1.75 (rounded down to the nearest whole number, which is 1)

Step 2: Calculate the remaining fabric after making the dresses.
Remaining fabric = Total fabric - (Number of dresses × Fabric required for one dress)
Remaining fabric = 925 meters - (1 × 529 meters)
Remaining fabric = 925 meters - 529 meters
Remaining fabric = 396 meters

Therefore, after completing the dresses, the tailor will have 396 meters of fabric left over.

Given information:
- The tailor has 62 meters of fabric left.

Step 1: Find the number of dresses the tailor can make with the remaining fabric.
Number of dresses = Remaining fabric / Fabric required for one dress
Number of dresses = 62 meters / 529 meters per dress
Number of dresses = 0.117 (rounded down to the nearest whole number, which is 0)

Since the tailor cannot make a complete dress with the remaining 62 meters of fabric, no dresses will be made.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining fabric after attempting to make the dresses.
Remaining fabric = Initial fabric - (Number of dresses × Fabric required for one dress)
Remaining fabric = 62 meters - (0 × 529 meters)
Remaining fabric = 62 meters

Step 1: Find the number of tour groups needed to accommodate all the tourists.
Number of tour groups = Total number of tourists / Maximum capacity of each tour group
Number of tour groups = 976 / 530
Number of tour groups = 1.84 (rounded down to 1 since we cannot have a partial group)

Step 2: Calculate the number of tourists accommodated in the first tour group.
Number of tourists accommodated in the first tour group = 530

Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of tourists for the last group.

Number of tour groups = Total number of tourists / Maximum capacity of each tour group
Number of tour groups = 976 / 726
Number of tour groups = 1.34 (rounded down to 1 since we cannot have a partial group)

Step 2: Calculate the number of tourists accommodated in the first tour group.
Number of tourists accommodated in the first tour group = 726

Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of tourists for the last group.
