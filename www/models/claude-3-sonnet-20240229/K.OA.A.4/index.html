    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sunglasses Jeff had before buying the 4 new ones last summer.

Given information:
- Jeff has a collection of 10 sunglasses.
- He bought 4 sunglasses last summer.

We can represent the number of sunglasses Jeff had before buying the new ones as x.

After buying the 4 new sunglasses, the total number of sunglasses he has is 10.

We can set up an equation:
x + 4 = 10

Solving for x:
x = 10 - 4
x = 6

Therefore, Jeff had 6 sunglasses before buying the 4 new ones last summer.

        John's boat can hold 10 people. Currently, there are 6 adults on the boat. How many children can he still put on the boat?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the remaining capacity of the boat after the 6 adults have boarded, and then determine how many children can fit in that remaining space.

Given information:
- John's boat can hold a maximum of 10 people.
- There are currently 6 adults on the boat.

Step 1: Find the remaining capacity of the boat after the 6 adults have boarded.
Maximum capacity of the boat - Number of adults on the boat = Remaining capacity
10 people - 6 adults = 4 remaining spaces

Step 2: Determine how many children can fit in the remaining spaces.
Since each child occupies one space, the number of children that can still be put on the boat is equal to the remaining capacity.

Number of children that can still be put on the boat = Remaining capacity
Number of children that can still be put on the boat = 4

Therefore, John can still put 4 children on the boat.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number that, when added to 8, gives us 10.

Given information:
- The sum of 8 and another number is 10.

Let's represent the unknown number as x.

We can write the equation as:
8 + x = 10

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
8 + x - 8 = 10 - 8
x = 2

Therefore, the other number that, when added to 8, gives 10 is 2.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pizzas that were not pepperoni pizzas, as those would be the mushroom pizzas.

Given information:
- Maria prepared a total of 10 pizzas.
- 6 of the pizzas were pepperoni pizzas.

Step 1: Find the number of pizzas that were not pepperoni pizzas.
Total pizzas - Pepperoni pizzas = Non-pepperoni pizzas
10 - 6 = 4 non-pepperoni pizzas

Since the question states that the remaining pizzas were mushroom pizzas, the number of mushroom pizzas is 4.

Therefore, the number of mushroom pizzas Maria prepared is 4.

Remaining amount = Cost of the computer - Amount already paid
Remaining amount = $10 - $3
Remaining amount = $7

Therefore, you still need to pay $7 to cover the full cost of the computer.

Given information:
- King Arthur's castle has ten towers.
- There are two towers to the east of the castle.

Since the castle has a total of ten towers, and two of them are to the east, the remaining towers must be to the west.

Number of towers to the west = Total towers - Towers to the east
Number of towers to the west = 10 - 2
Number of towers to the west = 8

Therefore, there are eight towers to the west of King Arthur's castle.

Given information:
- Sarah has a total of 10 books in her collection.
- 5 of these books are novels.

Since the total number of books is 10, and 5 of them are novels, the remaining books must be non-novels.

To find the number of non-novels, we subtract the number of novels from the total number of books.

Number of non-novels = Total number of books - Number of novels
Number of non-novels = 10 - 5
Number of non-novels = 5

Therefore, 5 of Sarah's books are non-novels.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cows that are not brown.

Given information:
- There are 10 cows in total on the farm.
- 9 of the cows are brown.

Since there are 10 cows in total, and 9 of them are brown, the remaining cow must be of a different color, which is likely black.

To find the number of black cows, we subtract the number of brown cows from the total number of cows.

Number of black cows = Total number of cows - Number of brown cows
Number of black cows = 10 - 9
Number of black cows = 1

Therefore, there is 1 black cow on the farm.

Given information:
- The alien discovered a total of 10 new species of plants.
- The alien found 7 species during his morning walk.

Since the total number of species discovered is 10, and the alien found 7 species during his morning walk, we can find the number of species found during the evening walk by subtracting 7 from 10.

Number of species found during the evening walk = Total species discovered - Species found during the morning walk
Number of species found during the evening walk = 10 - 7
Number of species found during the evening walk = 3

Therefore, the alien found 3 new species of plants during his evening walk.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chocolates John received on Valentine's Day.

Given information:
- John received 10 chocolates in total on Valentine's Day.
- He already had 4 chocolates before Valentine's Day.

Let's represent the number of chocolates he received on Valentine's Day as x.

We know that the total number of chocolates he had after Valentine's Day is the sum of the chocolates he already had and the chocolates he received on Valentine's Day.

Total chocolates after Valentine's Day = Chocolates he already had + Chocolates received on Valentine's Day
10 = 4 + x

Solving for x:
x = 10 - 4
x = 6

Therefore, John was given 6 chocolates on Valentine's Day.

Given information:
- Captain Hook has 10 cannons in total.
- 5 cannons are on one side of the ship.

Since the total number of cannons is 10, and 5 are on one side, the remaining cannons must be on the other side.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the time the kite spent flying before reaching its highest point.

Given information:
- The kite flies for exactly 10 minutes.
- The kite spent 6 minutes at its highest point.

Since the total flight time is 10 minutes, and the kite spent 6 minutes at its highest point, the remaining time must be the time it took to reach the highest point.

Time taken to reach the highest point = Total flight time - Time spent at the highest point
Time taken to reach the highest point = 10 minutes - 6 minutes
Time taken to reach the highest point = 4 minutes

Therefore, the kite flew for 4 minutes before reaching its highest point.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the total number of bars in the piece and the number of bars Sara has already composed.

Given information:
- The piano piece is 10 bars long.
- Sara has already composed 5 bars.

Step 1: Find the number of bars remaining to be composed.
Number of bars remaining = Total number of bars - Number of bars already composed
