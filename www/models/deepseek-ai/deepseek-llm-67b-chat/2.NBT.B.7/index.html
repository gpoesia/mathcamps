        In one month, a fireplace company sold 278 traditional wood-burning fireplaces. In the same month, they also sold 305 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones. How many gas fireplaces did the company sell?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The company sold 305 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones, so the number of gas fireplaces sold is 278 + 305 = &lt;&lt;278+305=583&gt;&gt;583.

The sun radiates 752 quintillion joules of energy every second.
During night time on the earth, approximately 243 quintillion joules of this energy isn't received.

The earth needs at least 730 quintillion joules of energy from the sun every second to maintain its current temperature.
During nighttime, the earth receives 509 quintillion joules of energy every second.
So, the energy lacking every second during nighttime is 730 - 509 = &lt;&lt;730-509=221&gt;&gt;221 quintillion joules.

The sun radiates 752 quintillion joules of energy every second.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total number of books in the children's section is 727.
The number of books that are on loan is 309.
To find out how many books are left, we subtract the number of books on loan from the total number of books.
727 - 309 = 418 books are left.
The librarian wants to have a total of 561 books in the children's section.
To find out how many more books are needed, we subtract the number of books left from the desired total.

        Continuing from our previous problem, the ballerina, later in the evening, decided to add to her routine and performed some more pirouettes. However, she was a bit tired and was unable to count exactly how many she did. She only knew that after those additional pirouettes, the total number of pirouettes she did for the day was 314 less than if she had doubled the number of pirouettes she performed before dinner. How many pirouettes did she do after dinner?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let x be the number of pirouettes she did after dinner.
The total number of pirouettes she did for the day is 2 * (212 + 363) - 314 = 1140 - 314 = 826.
So, x + 575 = 826.
Therefore, x = 826 - 575 = 251.

        In a particular paragraph, John found 52 word repetitions. Later, he realized that he made a mistake and he actually counted only half of them. What is the total number of word repetitions he should have counted in that paragraph?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John counted only half of the word repetitions, so the total number of word repetitions is 52*2 = &lt;&lt;52*2=104&gt;&gt;104.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total number of words in the paragraph is 318, and the number of word repetitions is 104. So, the number of unique words is 318 - 104 = &lt;&lt;318-104=214&gt;&gt;214.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the length of the additional rope as x.
The total length of both ropes is 623 + x.
According to the problem, the total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope, so we can write the equation:
623 + x = 623 + 377
Now we can solve for x:
x = 623 + 377 - 623
x = 377
The length of the additional rope is 377 meters.
The total length of both ropes is 623 + 377 = 1000 meters.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the length of the additional rope as x.
The total length of both ropes is 472 + x.
According to the problem, the total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope, so we can write the equation:
472 + x = 472 + 377
Now we can solve for x:
x = 472 + 377 - 472
x = 377
The length of the additional rope is 377 meters.
The total length of both ropes is 472 + 377 = 849 meters.

        Let's say originally, there were actually 855 kites in the sky at the beginning of the kite festival instead of 577. After the same number of 256 kites were taken down, how many kites would have remained in the sky?
