        Maria drove her car for 8 hours at a speed of 4/7 miles per hour. In another trip, she initially had 38 dollars for gas but spent 50/4 dollars on gas. What is the summation of the total miles Maria drove and the remaining amount of money she had for gas?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Maria drove 8*4/7 = &lt;&lt;8*4/7=32/7&gt;&gt;32/7 miles in the first trip.
Maria spent 50/4 = &lt;&lt;50/4=12.5&gt;&gt;12.5 dollars on gas.
The remaining amount of money she had for gas is 38-12.5 = &lt;&lt;38-12.5=25.5&gt;&gt;25.5 dollars.
The summation of the total miles Maria drove and the remaining amount of money she had for gas is 32/7+25.5 = &lt;&lt;32/7+25.5=70.35714285714286&gt;&gt;70.35714285714286.
