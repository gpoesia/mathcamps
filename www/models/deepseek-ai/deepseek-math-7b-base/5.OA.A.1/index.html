        A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?
    </p>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The company has 2840/40 = &lt;&lt;2840/40=71&gt;&gt;71 packs of socks left to package.
The company has 71+93 = &lt;&lt;71+93=164&gt;&gt;164 packs of socks in total.
The company has 164+70-8 = &lt;&lt;164+70-8=226&gt;&gt;226 packs of socks now.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The kite maker has 41+63+57 = &lt;&lt;41+63+57=161&gt;&gt;161 kites.
The kite maker multiplies their current inventory by 18, so they have 161*18 = &lt;&lt;161*18=2898&gt;&gt;2898 kites.
The kite maker adds the original inventory to this increased production, so they have 2898+161 = &lt;&lt;2898+161=3059&gt;&gt;3059 kites now.

        After reviewing the production data, the toy car factory realized there was a mistake in their calculation. They actually produce only 4 toy cars every minute instead of 5. If they continue to produce for 76 minutes and add another batch of 49 toy cars as before, how many toy cars will the factory have now?
