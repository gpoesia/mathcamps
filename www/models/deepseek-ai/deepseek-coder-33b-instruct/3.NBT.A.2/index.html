The rocket's initial height was 825 meters, and its final height after descending was 429 meters. The difference between these two heights is the height difference that the rocket has descended.

We can calculate this difference by subtracting the final height from the initial height.

825 - 429 = &lt;&lt;825-429=396&gt;&gt;396 meters.
