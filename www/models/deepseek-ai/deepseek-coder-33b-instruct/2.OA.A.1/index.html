    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: Harvey has 70 roller skates in total. He has 42 for children. So, the remaining roller skates are for adults.
70 - 42 = &lt;&lt;70-42=28&gt;&gt;28 roller skates are for adults.

        A town has 98 dogs in total. Some dogs relocated to another town, leaving 73 dogs. How many dogs relocated from the town?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The number of dogs that relocated from the town is the difference between the total number of dogs before and after the relocation.
73 dogs - 98 dogs = &lt;&lt;73-98=-25&gt;&gt;-25 dogs relocated from the town.
However, the number of dogs cannot be negative, so the actual number of dogs that relocated from the town is 25 dogs.

        Captain Bruce's pirate ship weighs 78 tons with all the crew members and cargo. However, once they remove the cargo which weighs 74 tons, the weight of the ship with just the crew is needed. What is the weight of the pirate ship with just the crew (in tons)?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
The weight of the ship with just the crew is the total weight of the ship minus the weight of the cargo.

So, the weight of the ship with just the crew is 78 - 74 = &lt;&lt;78-74=4&gt;&gt;4 tons.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

Reasoning: Amy has 75 skirts in her wardrobe. If 18 of those skirts are red, then the remaining skirts are not red.
So, the number of skirts that are not red is 75 - 18 = &lt;&lt;75-18=57&gt;&gt;57.

        In a large dormitory, there are a certain number of beds. When 8 beds were removed for repair, there were still 72 beds left. How many beds were there in the dormitory originally?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: If 8 beds were removed for repair, then the number of beds left is the original number of beds minus the number of removed beds. So, the original number of beds is the number of beds left plus the number of removed beds.

Let's denote the original number of beds as O. Then we have the following equation:

O = 72 + 8.

Solving this equation for O gives us the original number of beds.

Let's solve it.

O = 72 + 8
O = 80.

So, there were originally 80 beds in the dormitory.

        The zoo started the day with some number of animals, which we'll call s. During the day, 24 animals were moved to a separate area of the zoo for cleaning and care. After this, there were still 75 animals visible to visitors in the main section of the zoo. How many animals were there in total at the zoo at the start of the day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of animals at the start of the day is the sum of the number of animals moved to the cleaning area and the number of animals visible to visitors in the main section of the zoo.

Let's denote the number of animals at the start of the day as s.

We know that 24 animals were moved to the cleaning area, so s - 24 = &lt;&lt;s-24=s-24&gt;&gt;s - 24 animals were present at the start of the day.

We also know that there were 75 animals visible to visitors in the main section of the zoo, so s - 24 + 75 = &lt;&lt;s-24+75=s+51&gt;&gt;s + 51 animals were present at the start of the day.

Therefore, the total number of animals at the start of the day is s + 51 = &lt;&lt;s+51=s+51&gt;&gt;s + 51 animals.

        In a book, there are 42 words on the page. After reading some of the words, there are only 2 words left that you haven't read yet. How many words have you read?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of words in the book is 42. After reading some of the words, there are only 2 words left that you haven't read yet. So, the number of words you have read is the total number of words in the book minus the number of words left.

Number of words read = Total number of words - Number of words left

Number of words read = 42 - 2

Number of words read = 40

        A hat shop initially has a total of (z) hats. After selling 27 hats, there were 25 hats left in the store. How many hats did the store initially have?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The store initially had (z) hats. After selling 27 hats, there were 25 hats left in the store. So, we can set up the equation:

z - 27 = 25

Solving for z, we get:

z = 25 + 27

z = &lt;&lt;25+27=52&gt;&gt;52

So, the store initially had 52 hats.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
The length of the main part of the blanket is the total length of the blanket minus the length of the border.
