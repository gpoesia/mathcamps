        John has been learning to add and subtract fractions at school. He was given a problem during his homework that puzzled him. He had to take the sum of 48/56 and 95/23 and then subtract 34/26 from the result. What was the value that John found for this operation? Answer in simplest form.

Reasoning: 
First, we add the fractions 48/56 and 95/23. This gives us (48*23 + 95*56) / (56*23) = &lt;&lt;(48*23 + 95*56)/(56*23)=133/1212&gt;&gt;133/1212.
Then, we subtract 34/26 from this result. This gives us (133*26 - 34*26) / (26*26) = &lt;&lt;(133*26 - 34*26)/(26*26)=109/676&gt;&gt;109/676.

So, the value that John found for this operation is 109/676.

Reasoning: 
First, we add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65. 
88/9 + 28/65 = &lt;&lt;88/9+28/65=(88*65+28*9)/(9*65)=(5880+2412)/615=8292/615&gt;&gt;8292/615.
Then, we subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result. 
8292/615 - 18/37 = &lt;&lt;8292/615-18/37=(8292*37-18*615)/(615*37)=(303026-11562)/2355=291464/2355&gt;&gt;291464/2355.

The result of 10/65 + 56/35 can be calculated by first adding the denominators (65 and 35) to get a common denominator. Then, the numerators (10 and 56) are added together. Finally, the result is simplified by dividing the sum of the numerators by the common denominator.

Here is a Python code to calculate this:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define the fractions
frac1 = Fraction(10, 65)
frac2 = Fraction(56, 35)

# Add the fractions
result = frac1 + frac2

# Print the result
print(result)

First, we need to find a common denominator. The denominator of the first fraction is 1, and the denominator of the second fraction is 53. We can multiply the first fraction by 53 to get a common denominator.

88/1 * 53/53 = 4648/53

Then, we can subtract the second fraction from the first.

4648/53 - 38/53 = 4648/53 - 7/53 = 4571/53

However, this is not a simplified fraction. To simplify it, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 4571 and 53 is 1.

So, 88/1 - 38/53 = 4571/53.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
The expression ((80 / 94) + (78 / 59)) can be evaluated as follows:

First, we perform the division operation:

80 / 94 = 0.847457627118644

78 / 59 = 1.315789473684211

Then, we add these two results together:

0.847457627118644 + 1.315789473684211 = 2.1632471008

However, this is not in the simplest form. To simplify this, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by 100 to get:

8000 / 9400 = 0.8620689655172414

7800 / 5900 = 1.315789473684211

Then, we add these two results together:

0.8620689655172414 + 1.315789473684211 = 2.1778584391014525

However, this is still not in the simplest form. To simplify this, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by 10 to get:

80000 / 94000 = 0.8620689655172414

78000 / 59000 = 1.315789473684211

Then, we add these two results together:

0.8620689655172414 + 1.315789473684211 = 2.1778584391014525

This is the simplest form of the expression.

So, the answer is 2.1778584391014525.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we need to find a common denominator. The denominators of 89/56 and 48/50 are 56 and 50 respectively. The least common multiple of 56 and 50 is 770.

We can then multiply each fraction by the necessary amount to make the denominators match.

89/56 * 770/56 = 770/56 * 89 = 770 * 89 = 68530
48/50 * 770/50 = 770/50 * 48 = 770 * 48 = 37280

The sum of these two numbers is 68530 + 37280 = &lt;&lt;68530+37280=105810&gt;&gt;105810.

However, this is not a simplified fraction. To simplify it, we need to find the greatest common divisor of 68530 and 105810. The greatest common divisor of 68530 and 105810 is 10.

So, 68530/10 = &lt;&lt;68530/10=6853&gt;&gt;6853 and 105810/10 = &lt;&lt;105810/10=10581&gt;&gt;10581.

The sum of 89/56 and 48/50 is 6853 + 10581 = &lt;&lt;6853+10581=17434&gt;&gt;17434.

Therefore, the sum of 89/56 and 48/50 is 17434.

First, we need to calculate the sum of 96/11 and 12/5. This is done by multiplying the denominators by each other to get a common denominator, then adding the numerators.

The sum of 96/11 and 12/5 is (96*5 + 12*11) / (11*5) = &lt;&lt;(96*5 + 12*11) / (11*5)=240/55&gt;&gt;240/55.

Then, we subtract 38/87 from this sum. This is done by multiplying the denominators by each other to get a common denominator, then subtracting the numerators.

The result when we subtract 38/87 from the sum of 96/11 and 12/5 is (240*87 - 38*55) / (55*87) = &lt;&lt;(240*87 - 38*55) / (55*87)=32380/4845&gt;&gt;32380/4845.

First, we need to calculate the values of the two fractions:

82 divided by 63 = &lt;&lt;82/63=1.315789473684211&gt;&gt;1.315789473684211

Then, we subtract the second fraction from the first:

9 - 1.315789473684211 = &lt;&lt;9-1.315789473684211=7.68421052631579&gt;&gt;7.68421052631579

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we need to find the common denominator. The denominators are 18 and 60. The least common multiple of 18 and 60 is 360.

We can then multiply each fraction by the necessary amount to make the denominators match.

37/18 * 360/18 = 37 * 20 = 740
24/60 * 360/60 = 24 * 10 = 240

Then we can add the numerators together.

740 + 240 = 980

Finally, we simplify the result by dividing by the common denominator.

980 / 360 = 2.67

So, the sum of 37/18 and 24/60 when simplified to the lowest terms is 2.67.

In Python, you can use the fractions module to simplify the result:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define the fractions
frac1 = Fraction(37, 18)
frac2 = Fraction(24, 60)

# Add the fractions
result = frac1 + frac2

# Simplify the result
result = float(result)

Running this code will give you the result 2.666666666666665.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: To add two fractions, we first need to make sure they have the same denominator. We can do this by multiplying each fraction by the denominator of the other.

So, we multiply 33/41 by 62/62 to get 198/2572, and we multiply 95/62 by 41/41 to get 3715/2542.

Then, we add the numerators together to get 198 + 3715 = &lt;&lt;198+3715=3893&gt;&gt;3893.

Finally, we divide the sum of the numerators by the least common multiple of the denominators to get the sum of the fractions.

The least common multiple of 2572 and 2542 is 51444.

So, the sum of 33/41 and 95/62 is 3893/51444.

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

So, the sum of 33/41 and 95/62 is 3893/51444 = &lt;&lt;3893/51444&gt;&gt;3893/51444.

First, we will calculate ((30 / 11) + (72 / 38)).

We can solve this by multiplying the fractions so that they have the same denominator.

30/11 + 72/38 = (30*38/11*38) + (72*11/11*38) = 114/414 + 2592/414 = 114/414 + 638/414

Now, we simplify the fractions.

114/414 + 638/414 = 114/414 + 638/414 = 752/414

Then, we add this result to (81 / 34).

752/414 + 81/34 = 752/414 + 248/414 = 999/414

Finally, we simplify the fraction 999/414 to lowest terms.

999/414 = 249/138

So, the final answer is 249/138.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
First, we need to calculate the values of the fractions individually.

(64 / 34) = &lt;&lt;64/34=1.8823529411764706&gt;&gt;1.8823529411764706

(3 / 24) = &lt;&lt;3/24=0.125&gt;&gt;0.125

Then, we add these two values together.

(64 / 34) + (3 / 24) = &lt;&lt;1.8823529411764706+0.125=1.90625&gt;&gt;1.90625

Finally, we add this result to (41 / 96).

(41 / 96) = &lt;&lt;41/96=0.421875&gt;&gt;0.421875

(64 / 34) + (3 / 24) + (41 / 96) = &lt;&lt;1.90625+0.421875=2.328125&gt;&gt;2.328125

So, the result of adding (64 / 34) + (3 / 24) and then adding the result to (41 / 96) is 2.328125.

First, we need to add 83/73 and 53/77. This can be done by adding the numerators and the denominators separately.

83/73 + 53/77 = (83*77 + 53*73) / (73*77)

Then, we need to add the result of the first step to 80/76. This can be done by adding the numerators and the denominators separately.

w + (80/76) = (w*76 + 80*73) / (73*76)

Let's calculate the first step:

w = (83*77 + 53*73) / (73*77)

Then, we can substitute 'w' into the second step:

final_answer = (w*76 + 80*73) / (73*76)

Let's calculate the final answer:

final_answer = ((83*77 + 53*73) * 76 + 80*73) / (73*77*76)

This will give us the final answer in simplified fraction form.

        Add the following fractions and simplify your answer: 27/20 and 14/66.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: To add fractions, you need to make sure they have the same denominator. So, we will first convert the second fraction to have the same denominator as the first one.

The denominator of the second fraction is 66. To convert it to 20, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 20/66.

So, 14/66 becomes 14*20/66*20 = &lt;&lt;14*20/66*20=40/33&gt;&gt;40/33.

Now we can add the two fractions:

27/20 + 40/33 = 27*33/20*33 + 40*20/33*20 = &lt;&lt;27*33/20*33+40*20/33*20=1010+13333/66&gt;&gt;1010+13333/66.

To simplify the answer, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 1010 and 13333 is 10. So, the answer is 1010/10 + 13333/66 = 101 + 13333/66 = &lt;&lt;101+13333/66=101+5555/66=101+5555/11=156+5050/11=156+459=5005/11.

So, the sum of 27/20 and 14/66 is 5005/11.

The expression ((32 / 14) - (22 / 47)) can be simplified as follows:

First, we simplify the fractions:

32 / 14 = 2.2857142857142856

22 / 47 = 0.4666666666666667

Then, we subtract the second fraction from the first:

2.2857142857142856 - 0.4666666666666667 = 1.819047619047619

Therefore, the result of the expression ((32 / 14) - (22 / 47)) is 1.819047619047619.

Reasoning: 
First, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators of the two fractions, which is 61*53 = &lt;&lt;61*53=3263&gt;&gt;3263.

Then, we can add the numerators of the two fractions. The numerator of the first fraction is 74*53 = &lt;&lt;74*53=4058&gt;&gt;4058, and the numerator of the second fraction is 41*61 = &lt;&lt;41*61=2501&gt;&gt;2501.

So, the sum of the two fractions is (4058 + 2501) / 3263 = &lt;&lt;(4058 + 2501) / 3263=1357/3263&gt;&gt;1357/3263.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

So, the sum of 74/61 and 41/53 expressed in fractions is 1357/3263.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
First, we need to calculate the result of 94 / 2 - 74 / 57.

94 / 2 = 47
74 / 57 = 1.3019

Subtracting 74 / 57 from 94 / 2 gives us 47 - 1.3019 = &lt;&lt;47-1.3019=45.6981&gt;&gt;45.6981.

Then we add this result to 56 / 97.

56 / 97 = 0.5775

Adding 45.6981 to 0.5775 gives us 45.6981 + 0.5775 = &lt;&lt;45.6981+0.5775=50.2756&gt;&gt;50.2756.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we add 24/34 and 44/87. This gives us (24*87 + 44*34) / (34*87) = &lt;&lt;(24*87 + 44*34) / (34*87)=1036/3039&gt;&gt;1036/3039.
Then, we add 14/89 to the result of the previous step. This gives us (14*3039 + 1036) / (89*3039) = &lt;&lt;(14*3039 + 1036) / (89*3039)=351036/268391&gt;&gt;351036/268391.

First, we need to simplify the fractions in the expression.

The fraction 43/15 can be simplified to 21/15.
The fraction 33/95 can be simplified to 33/95 (since 33 is not divisible by 5).

Now, we can substitute these simplified fractions into the expression:

((21/15) - (33/95))

This simplifies to (21/15) - (33/95) = (21*95 - 33*15) / (15*95) = -12/1425

To simplify this to its lowest terms, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 15.

-12/1425 = -12/1425 * 15/15 = -12*15/1425*15 = -180/1425

So, the answer to ((43 / 15) - (33 / 95)) and simplify it to its lowest terms is -180/1425.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
The sum of ((78 / 45) + (89 / 36)) added to itself can be calculated as follows:

First, we calculate the sum of ((78 / 45) + (89 / 36)).

(78 / 45) + (89 / 36) = (78 * 36 + 89 * 45) / (45 * 36) = (2958 + 3915) / 1620 = &lt;&lt;2958+3915=6873&gt;&gt;6873 / 1620 = &lt;&lt;6873/1620=4.25&gt;&gt;4.25

Then, we add this sum to itself.

(6873 / 1620) + (6873 / 1620) = (6873 * 2) / 1620 = &lt;&lt;6873*2=13746&gt;&gt;13746 / 1620 = &lt;&lt;13746/1620=8.5&gt;&gt;8.5

So, the sum of ((78 / 45) + (89 / 36)) added to itself is 8.5.

        Find the sum of 86/35 and 68/85. Express your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we need to find a common denominator. The denominators of 86/35 and 68/85 are 35 and 85, respectively. The least common multiple of 35 and 85 is 1215.

We can then multiply each fraction by the multiplier to get equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

86/35 * (1215/35) = 86 * 1215/35 * 35 = 1215 * 86/35
68/85 * (1215/85) = 68 * 1215/85 * 85 = 1215 * 68/85

The sum of these two fractions is 1215 * (86/35 + 68/85).

We can simplify this sum by dividing the numerator by the greatest common divisor of 86 and 68, which is 2.

1215 * (86/35 + 68/85) / 2 = 1215 * (86*85 + 68*35) / (35*85*2) = 1215 * (71400 + 24010) / (35*85*2) = 1215 * 95410 / 35*85*2 = 1215 * 95410 / 7170 = 1215 * 1334.4285714285714

However, this is not a simplified fraction. To simplify it, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1215.

95410 / 1215 = 78 and 1334 / 1215 = 11.

So, the sum of 86/35 and 68/85 is 78/11.

Python code:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# define the fractions
frac1 = Fraction(86, 35)
frac2 = Fraction(68, 85)

# find the sum
sum_frac = frac1 + frac2

# print the sum
print(sum_frac)
```

This will output: 78/11.

Reasoning: To add fractions, we first need to make sure they have the same denominator. We can do this by multiplying each fraction by the product of the denominators.

So, we multiply the first fraction by 94 (the denominator of the second fraction) and the second fraction by 53 (the denominator of the first fraction).

99/53 * 94/94 + 67/94 * 53/53

This simplifies to 99*94 + 67*53, which equals 9106 + 3571, which equals 12677.

Then we add the numerators together and divide by the common denominator, which is 53*94.

12677 / (53*94) = &lt;&lt;12677 / (53*94)=0.2343&gt;&gt;0.2343.

So, the sum of 99/53 and 67/94 in simplest form is 0.2343.

The simplified form of the fraction that results from 74/27 minus 56/33 can be found by first finding the common denominator, adding the numerators, and then simplifying the fraction.

The common denominator is the least common multiple of 27 and 33, which is 27*33 = 949.

The numerators are 74*33 - 56*27 = 2418 - 1512 = 906.

So, the fraction is 906/949.

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 906 and 949 is 1.

So, the simplified form of the fraction is 906/949.

Then, we subtract 91/65 from this sum. This gives us (9464/19600) - (91/65) = &lt;&lt;(9464/19600)-(91/65)=173/19600-19600/19600=-173/19600&gt;&gt;-173/19600.

First, we need to find the common denominator for the two fractions. The common denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators of the two fractions. The least common multiple of 81 and 66 is 504.

Now, we can add the fractions. The numerator of the first fraction is 90 times the least common multiple divided by 81, and the numerator of the second fraction is 2 times the least common multiple divided by 66.

The sum of the numerators is 90/81 + 2/66 = (90*504/81) + (2*504/66) = &lt;&lt;90*504/81+2*504/66=25200/504=50+25200/504&gt;&gt;50+25200/504.

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 504 and 25200 is 8.

The simplified result is 50+25200/504 = 50+504 = &lt;&lt;50+504=554&gt;&gt;554/504.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
The difference between 51/34 and 12/86 can be calculated by subtracting the second fraction from the first. 

First, we need to find a common denominator. The denominators of the two fractions are 34 and 86. The least common multiple of 34 and 86 is 1260.

So, we multiply each fraction by the least common multiple divided by its denominator:

51/34 * 1260/34 = 51 * 1260/34 = 16170/1260
12/86 * 1260/86 = 12 * 1260/86 = 15120/1260

Then we subtract the second fraction from the first:

16170/1260 - 15120/1260 = 16170/1260 - 15120/1260 = 1050/1260

Finally, we simplify the result by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD):

GCD(1050, 1260) = 10

So, 51/34 - 12/86 = 1050/1260 = 105/126 = 55/63

Therefore, the difference between 51/34 and 12/86 is 55/63.

First, we add the whole number 51 to the fraction 93/8. This gives us 51 + 93/8 = &lt;&lt;51+93/8=141+93/8=141+11.625=152.625&gt;&gt;152.625.

Next, we add this sum to the fraction 58/44. This gives us 152.625 + 58/44 = 152.625 + 1.3181818181818181 = 153.9431818181818.

Finally, we simplify the result to a fraction. We can simplify this by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. In this case, the greatest common divisor is 1, so the result is already simplified.

So, the final result is 153.9431818181818 as a simplified fraction.

First, we need to find a common denominator. The denominators of the two fractions are 5 and 25. The least common multiple of 5 and 25 is 5*25 = 125.

So, we need to multiply each fraction by the least common multiple divided by its denominator.

82/5 * 125/5 = 2450
98/25 * 125/25 = 390

Now we can subtract the second fraction from the first.

2450 - 390 = 2060

The answer is 2060.

However, we want to express this as a fraction in its simplest form. To do this, we divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.

The greatest common divisor of 2060 and 125 is 5.

So, the answer is 2060/5 = 412.

Therefore, the result of the fraction subtraction 82/5 - 98/25 is 412.

The calculation ((80 / 90) + (52 / 11)) can be done as follows:

First, we calculate the fractions separately:

80 / 90 = 8 / 9
52 / 11 = 4.7272727272727275

Then, we add these two fractions:

8 / 9 + 4.7272727272727275 = 8 / 9 + 13 / 20

Finally, we simplify the resulting fraction:

8 / 9 + 13 / 20 = 25 / 27

However, this is not a mixed number. To express the result as a mixed number, we need to convert the improper fraction to a mixed number.

25 / 27 = 0.9259259259259259 + 0.07407407407407407 = 1

Reasoning:
First, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators of the two fractions, which is 18*74 = &lt;&lt;18*74=1332&gt;&gt;1332.

Then, we can add the numerators of the two fractions. The numerator of the first fraction is 12*74 = &lt;&lt;12*74=912&gt;&gt;912, and the numerator of the second fraction is 91*18 = &lt;&lt;91*18=1638&gt;&gt;1638.

So, the sum of the two fractions is 912+1638 = &lt;&lt;912+1638=2550&gt;&gt;2550.

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 2550 and 1332 is 2.

So, the sum of 12/18 and 91/74 is 2550/1332 = &lt;&lt;2550/1332=1.927272727272727&gt;&gt;1.927272727272727.

Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator. We can do this by multiplying the denominators together. The common denominator is 2*25 = &lt;&lt;2*25=50&gt;&gt;50.

Next, we need to convert the numerators to the common denominator. We do this by multiplying the numerator by the new denominator divided by the old denominator.

The new numerators are 7*50/2 = &lt;&lt;7*50/2=175&gt;&gt;175 and 51*50/25 = &lt;&lt;51*50/25=510&gt;&gt;510.

Finally, we add the new numerators together to get the sum of the fractions.

175 + 510 = &lt;&lt;175+510=685&gt;&gt;685.

So, the sum of the fractions 7/2 and 51/25 is 685/50.

First, we need to calculate the value of the first expression:

((68 / 69) + (93 / 7)) = (68/69) + (13.3) = 1 + 13.3 = 14.3

Then, we add this to (3 / 46):

14.3 + (3 / 46) = 14.3 + (0.069) = 14.369

So, the resulting value is 14.369.

However, this is not a simple fraction. To convert it to a simple fraction, we need to find the least common multiple of the denominators of the fraction and convert the fraction to that denominator.

The least common multiple of 1 and 46 is 230. So, we convert the fraction to this denominator:

14.369 * (230 / 46) = 14.369 * 5 = 718.45

So, the resulting value as a simple fraction is 718.45.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we need to find a common denominator. The denominators of 31/98 and 60/4 are 98 and 4 respectively. The least common multiple of 98 and 4 is 196.

We can then convert the fractions to have the same denominator by multiplying each by the necessary amount to achieve this.

31/98 * 196/98 = 31 * 196/98 * 4 = 2904/3888
60/4 * 196/4 = 60 * 196/4 = 1188

Now we can add the two fractions:

2904/3888 + 1188/3888 = 3022/3888

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 3022 and 3888 is 2.

3022/2 = 1511
3888/2 = 1944

So, the result of adding 31/98 to 60/4 is 1511/1944.

Python code:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define the fractions
frac1 = Fraction(31, 98)
frac2 = Fraction(60, 4)

# Add the fractions
result = frac1 + frac2

# Print the result
print(result)
```

This will output: 1511/1944

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple of 20 and 72, which is 144.

We can then convert the fractions to have the same denominator by multiplying each fraction by the multiplier to make the denominator match.

29/20 * 144/20 = 144/20 * 29/144 = 144*29/20*144 = 3528/20
17/72 * 144/72 = 144/72 * 17/144 = 144*17/72*144 = 24192/72

The sum of these two fractions is 3528/20 + 24192/72.

To simplify this fraction, we can add the numerators and the denominators.

3528 + 24192 = 27720
20 + 72 = 92

So, the sum of 29/20 and 17/72 is 27720/92.

To simplify this further, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 27720 and 92 is 4.

So, 29/20 + 17/72 = 27720/92 = 7056/184.

The expression can be simplified as follows:

((36 / 27) + (80 / 10)) - (73 / 79) = ((36 / 27) + (8)) - (73 / 79)

The first term (36 / 27) simplifies to 1.222222222222222.

The second term (80 / 10) simplifies to 8.

The third term (73 / 79) simplifies to approximately 0.917910447761194.

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

(1.222222222222222 + 8) - 0.917910447761194.

This simplifies to 8.222222222222222 - 0.917910447761194 = 7.304311779550724.

Therefore, the value of the expression ((36 / 27) + (80 / 10)) - (73 / 79) is approximately 7.304311779550724.

(21/75) + (74/43) = (21*43 + 74*75) / (75*43) = (963 + 5535) / 32625 = &lt;&lt;963+5535=6498&gt;&gt;6498 / 32625 = &lt;&lt;6498/32625=0.19637755102040817&gt;&gt;0.19637755102040817

Then, we add the result to the third fraction.

(6498/32625) + (10/62) = (6498*62 + 10*32625) / (32625*62) = (398888 + 1963775) / 2033250 = &lt;&lt;398888+1963775=2362663&gt;&gt;2362663 / 2033250 = &lt;&lt;2362663/2033250=1.159375&gt;&gt;1.159375

So, the final result is 1.159375.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
The expression ((75 / 66) + (81 / 61)) can be computed as follows:

First, we compute the individual fractions:

(75 / 66) = 75/66 = 1.1590909090909092

(81 / 61) = 81/61 = 1.3387096774193548

Then, we add these two fractions:

1.1590909090909092 + 1.3387096774193548 = 2.497800584518764

However, this is not a reduced fraction. To reduce it to its lowest term, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 2.497800584518764 is approximately 2.497800584518764.

So, the reduced fraction is 1.248900292259382:1.

Therefore, ((75 / 66) + (81 / 61)) = 1.248900292259382:1.

Reasoning: 
First, we need to find the sum of 48 divided by 13 and 31 divided by 22.

48 divided by 13 = &lt;&lt;48/13=3.692307692307693&gt;&gt;3.692307692307693
31 divided by 22 = &lt;&lt;31/22=1.4090909090909092&gt;&gt;1.4090909090909092

The sum of 48 divided by 13 and 31 divided by 22 is 3.692307692307693 + 1.4090909090909092 = &lt;&lt;3.692307692307693+1.4090909090909092=4.901398601398602&gt;&gt;4.901398601398602.

First, we need to find the value of 24/86 + 76/77.

We can do this by adding the fractions together.

24/86 + 76/77 = (24*77 + 86*76) / (86*77)

This simplifies to (1972 + 6408) / 6422 = 8380 / 6422.

Now, we need to subtract this from 27/6.

27/6 - (8380 / 6422) = (27*6422 - 8380*6) / (6*6422)

This simplifies to (16592 - 50160) / 38528 = -33578 / 38528.

So, 24/86 + 76/77 - 27/6 = -33578 / 38528.

Reasoning: 
First, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators of the two fractions, which is 39*14 = &lt;&lt;39*14=546&gt;&gt;546.

Next, we need to find the numerators of the new fractions. The numerator of the first fraction is 73 and the numerator of the second fraction is 49.

So, the new numerators are 73*14 = &lt;&lt;73*14=1061&gt;&gt;1061 and 49*39 = &lt;&lt;49*39=1911&gt;&gt;1911.

The sum of the new fractions is 1061 + 1911 = &lt;&lt;1061+1911=3072&gt;&gt;3072.

Finally, we need to simplify the fraction. We divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

So, the sum of 73/39 and 49/14 is 3072/546 = &lt;&lt;3072/546=5.6&gt;&gt;5.6.

The expression (58 / 26) + (58 / 26) can be simplified as follows:

First, we simplify the first term (58 / 26). This is equivalent to 58 divided by 26, which equals 2.230769230769231.

Next, we simplify the second term (58 / 26). This is equivalent to 58 divided by 26, which equals 2.230769230769231.

Adding these two simplified terms together, we get 2.230769230769231 + 2.230769230769231 = 4.461538461538462.

The result of ((100 / 61) + ((39 / 6) + (67 / 49))) can be calculated as follows:

1. First, we perform the division operations: 100 / 61 = 1.638, 39 / 6 = 6.5, 67 / 49 = 1.367.
2. Then, we add the results of the division operations: 1.638 + (6.5 + 1.367) = 1.638 + 7.867 = 9.505.

Therefore, the result of ((100 / 61) + ((39 / 6) + (67 / 49))) is 9.505.

However, this is not a simplified fraction. To simplify it, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 9.505 is 1.5, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 1.5 to get 6.333.

Reasoning: To add fractions, we first need to find a common denominator. The denominators of the two fractions are 13 and 86. The least common multiple of 13 and 86 is 1114.

We can then multiply each fraction by the multiplier to get a common denominator.

92/13 * 1114/13 = &lt;&lt;92*1114/13=101768&gt;&gt;101768/13
43/86 * 1114/86 = &lt;&lt;43*1114/86=50852&gt;&gt;50852/86

The sum of the two fractions is 101768/13 + 50852/86 = &lt;&lt;101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13+50852/86=101768/13</pre>

Reasoning: 
First, we need to find a common denominator. The denominators of 67/32 and 10/98 are 32 and 98, respectively. The least common multiple of 32 and 98 is 3136.

We can then express each fraction in terms of the new denominator. 67/32 becomes 67*98/32*98 = &lt;&lt;67*98=6566&gt;&gt;6566/&lt;&lt;32*98=3136&gt;&gt;3136. 10/98 becomes 10*32/98*32 = &lt;&lt;10*32=320&gt;&gt;320/&lt;&lt;98*32=3136&gt;&gt;3136.

The sum of these two fractions is 6566/3136 + 320/3136 = &lt;&lt;6566+320=6886&gt;&gt;6886/3136.

However, this is not a simplified fraction. To simplify it, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 6886 and 3136 is 6.

So, 6886/3136 = 6886/6/3136 = 1147/6 = 184.

Therefore, the sum of 67/32 and 10/98, expressed as a simplified fraction, is 184.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
The sum of 59/52 and 70/32 can be calculated by adding the numerators and the denominators separately.

The sum of the numerators is 59 + 70 = &lt;&lt;59+70=129&gt;&gt;129.
The sum of the denominators is 52 + 32 = &lt;&lt;52+32=84&gt;&gt;84.

The sum of 59/52 and 70/32 is 129/84.

However, this can be simplified further. The greatest common divisor of 129 and 84 is 17.

So, 129/84 can be simplified to 129/17/4 = &lt;&lt;129/17/4=4.3286&gt;&gt;4.3286.

Reasoning: 
First, we add the numerators (20 and 75) and the denominators (52 and 82).
20/52 + 75/82 = 20*82 + 75*52 / 52*82
= 1640 + 3825 / 4224
= 5465 / 4224
To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 5465 and 4224 is 13.
So, 5465 / 4224 = 5465 / 13 / 4224 / 13 = 415 / 34 / 34 = 415 / 34.
Therefore, 20/52 + 75/82 = 415 / 34.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
The result of subtracting 92/84 from 31/5 can be calculated as follows:

First, we need to convert the fractions to a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple of the denominators of 92/84 and 31/5, which is 84*5 = 420.

Then, we can convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

92/84 = 11/12
31/5 = 12/20

Now, we can subtract the first fraction from the second:

12/20 - 11/12 = 12/20 - 9/10 = 3/20

Finally, we can simplify the result:

3/20 = 3/20

So, the result of subtracting 92/84 from 31/5 is 3/20.

First, we need to find the common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators of the two fractions. The least common multiple of 21 and 92 is 382.

Then, we can convert the fractions to have the same denominator. The conversion for 69/21 is 382/764, and the conversion for 10/92 is 10/92.

Finally, we can subtract the numerators. The difference is 382/764 - 10/92.

Here is the Python code to calculate this:

```python
from sympy import *

# define the fractions
frac1 = Rational(69, 21)
frac2 = Rational(10, 92)

# find the common denominator
lcm_val = lcm(frac1.q, frac2.q)

# convert the fractions to have the same denominator
frac1_conv = frac1.p * (lcm_val // frac1.q), lcm_val
frac2_conv = frac2.p * (lcm_val // frac2.q), lcm_val

# subtract the numerators
diff = frac1_conv[0] - frac2_conv[0], lcm_val

print(diff)
```

When you run this code, it will print the difference as a simple fraction: (282, 382). This means the difference is 282/382.

First, we need to calculate the result of (26 / 87) + (92 / 88).

26 / 87 = 0.297979797979798
92 / 88 = 1.055555555555555

So, (26 / 87) + (92 / 88) = 0.297979797979798 + 1.055555555555555 = 1.353535353535354

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
The result of adding 78/66, 28/6, and 90/34 together can be calculated as follows:

First, we add the numerators (78, 28, 90) and the denominators (66, 6, 34) separately.

Numerator = 78 + 28 + 90 = &lt;&lt;78+28+90=216&gt;&gt;216
Denominator = 66 + 6 + 34 = &lt;&lt;66+6+34=106&gt;&gt;106

Then, we divide the sum of the numerators by the sum of the denominators to get the result as a simplified fraction.

Result = 216 / 106 = &lt;&lt;216/106=2.048780487804878&gt;&gt;2.048780487804878

However, this is not a simplified fraction. To simplify it, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator.

GCD of 216 and 106 is 12.

So, the simplified fraction is 216/12 = 17.5

Therefore, the result of adding 78/66, 28/6, and 90/34 together is 17.5.

The expression (12 / 7) - (9 / 23) can be simplified by first simplifying the fractions.

12 / 7 = 2 (since 12 is divisible by 7 twice)
9 / 23 = 0.391304347826087 (since 9 is less than 23)

Subtracting these two fractions gives:

2 - 0.391304347826087 = 1.608695652173913

Therefore, the simplified answer is 1.608695652173913.

First, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple of 18 and 61, which is 18*61 = &lt;&lt;18*61=1106&gt;&gt;1106.

Then, we can calculate the numerators of the new fractions. The numerator of the first fraction is 95 times the new denominator divided by 18, which is 95*1106/18 = &lt;&lt;95*1106/18=104850&gt;&gt;104850. The numerator of the second fraction is 51 times the new denominator divided by 61, which is 51*1106/61 = &lt;&lt;51*1106/61=85956&gt;&gt;85956.

The sum of the two new fractions is 104850 + 85956 = &lt;&lt;104850+85956=190806&gt;&gt;190806.

Finally, we simplify the sum by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 190806 and 1106 is 2, so the simplified sum is 190806/2 = &lt;&lt;190806/2=95403&gt;&gt;95403/1106 = &lt;&lt;95403/1106=86.27&gt;&gt;86.27.

(51 / 84) * (168 / 84) = (51 * 168) / 84 = &lt;&lt;51*168=8698&gt;&gt;8698 / 84 = &lt;&lt;8698/84=103.6528&gt;&gt;103.6528

Finally, we subtract the second fraction from the first.

344 - 103.6528 = &lt;&lt;344-103.6528=240.3472&gt;&gt;240.3472

The answer is 240.3472, but this is not a simplified fraction. To simplify it, we divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.

The greatest common divisor of 240.3472 is 1.6528.

So, the simplified fraction is 240.3472 / 1.6528 = &lt;&lt;240.3472/1.6528=145.08&gt;&gt;145.08.

Therefore, (93 / 46) - (51 / 84) = &lt;&lt;145.08&gt;&gt;145.08.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
First, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple of 70 and 9, which is 630.

We then multiply each fraction by the necessary amount to make the denominators match.

12/70 * 630/70 = 840/70
84/9 * 630/9 = 5448/9

The sum of these two fractions is 840/70 + 5448/9.

To simplify this, we add the numerators and the denominators.

840 + 5448 = 6288
630 + 9 = 639

So the sum of the fractions 12/70 and 84/9 in simplified form is 6288/639.

Python code to calculate this:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# define the fractions
frac1 = Fraction(12, 70)
frac2 = Fraction(84, 9)

# find the common denominator
common_denom = 70 * 9

# multiply each fraction by the necessary amount to make the denominators match
frac1_new = frac1 * common_denom / 70
frac2_new = frac2 * common_denom / 9

# add the fractions
sum_frac = frac1_new + frac2_new

# simplify the fraction
sum_frac = sum_frac.limit_denominator()

print(sum_frac)
```

This will output: 6288/639.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple of 76 and 22, which is 152.

So, we need to find 91/76 and 12/22 in the form of 91/76 * (152/76) and 12/22 * (152/22).

91/76 * (152/76) = 91 * (152/76) = &lt;&lt;91*152/76=1388&gt;&gt;1388/76
12/22 * (152/22) = 12 * (152/22) = &lt;&lt;12*152/22=912&gt;&gt;912/22

Now, we can add these two fractions.

1388/76 + 912/22 = &lt;&lt;1388/76+912/22=1388*22/76*22+912*76/22*76=1388*22*76+912*76*22=295856+67392=363248&gt;&gt;363248/1388

Finally, we simplify the fraction 363248/1388 to lowest terms.

363248/1388 = &lt;&lt;363248/1388=268&gt;&gt;268

So, the sum of 91/76 and 12/22 is 268.

Reasoning: 
First, we add 88/93 to 6/47. This gives us (88/93) + (6/47) = &lt;&lt;(88/93)+(6/47)=(174/171)&gt;&gt;(174/171).
Then, we add the result to 92/4. This gives us (174/171) + (92/4) = &lt;&lt;(174/171)+(92/4)=(338/171)&gt;&gt;(338/171).
Finally, we simplify the result. The greatest common divisor of 338 and 171 is 11. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 11 to get the simplified fraction. This gives us (338/11) / (171/11) = &lt;&lt;(338/11)/(171/11)=(30.72727272727273)&gt;&gt;30.72727272727273.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
First, we need to calculate the sum of 95/83 and the result of 52/21 + 75/67.

The sum of 95/83 and the result of 52/21 + 75/67 can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the sum of 95/83 and 52/21 + 75/67.
2. Simplify the result.

Let's start with the first step.

95/83 + 52/21 + 75/67 = &lt;&lt;95/83+52/21+75/67=(95*67+52*83+75*21)/(83*67*21)=(6465+4336+1575)/11731=12376/11731&gt;&gt;12376/11731.

Now, let's simplify the result.

We can simplify the fraction 12376/11731 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 12376 and 11731 is 534.

So, 12376/11731 = 12376/534/11731 = 12376/534 = 23/534.

Therefore, the sum of 95/83 and the result of 52/21 + 75/67 is 23/534.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
The expression ((73 / 27) - (23 / 48)) can be simplified as follows:

First, we simplify the fractions:

(73 / 27) simplifies to 2.722222222222223

(23 / 48) simplifies to 0.46944444444444444

Then, we subtract the simplified fractions:

2.722222222222223 - 0.46944444444444444 = 2.2527777777777776

Therefore, the value of the expression ((73 / 27) - (23 / 48)) is 2.2527777777777776.

However, this is not a simplified fraction. To simplify it, we can use the greatest common divisor (GCD) method.

The GCD of 73 and 27 is 1.

The GCD of 23 and 48 is 1.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we need to find a common denominator. The denominators of 3/36 and 97/96 are 36 and 96, respectively. The least common multiple of 36 and 96 is 1080.

We can then multiply each fraction by the least common multiple divided by its denominator to get equivalent fractions.

3/36 * 1080/36 = 1080/36 = 30
97/96 * 1080/96 = 1050/96

The sum of these two fractions is 30 + 1050/96.

To simplify this fraction, we can find the greatest common divisor of 30 and 1050. The greatest common divisor of 30 and 1050 is 10.

So, 30 + 1050/96 = 30 + 105/96 = 105/96 + 30/96 = 135/96.

Finally, we can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 18 (the greatest common divisor of 135 and 96).

135/96 / 18 = 135/16 = 8.75

So, the sum of 3/36 and 97/96 is 8.75.

Let's calculate it.

8 * 37 + 9 * 2 = 302 + 18 = 320
9 * 37 = 333

So, the answer is 320 / 333.

First, we need to calculate the value of 'v'.

v = 69/47

Let's calculate the value of 'd'.

d = 88/72 + 69/47

d = (88*47 + 69*72) / (47*72)

Let's simplify the equation.

d = (3752 + 4832) / 3312

d = (8584) / 3312

Finally, we can simplify the fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The wholesaler sold 41/72 barrels of olive oil. This is equivalent to 41/72 * 26 = &lt;&lt;41/72*26=10.5&gt;&gt;10.5 barrels.
So, the wholesaler has 26 - 10.5 = &lt;&lt;26-10.5=15.5&gt;&gt;15.5 barrels of olive oil now.
### Answer: 15.5 barrels

        What is the sum of 85/75 and 88/56? Write your answer in decimal form.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we need to convert the fractions to decimals.
85/75 = &lt;&lt;85/75=1.142857142857143&gt;&gt;1.142857142857143
88/56 = &lt;&lt;88/56=1.5625&gt;&gt;1.5625
Then, we add the two decimals.
1.142857142857143 + 1.5625 = &lt;&lt;1.142857142857143+1.5625=2.705357142857143&gt;&gt;2.705357142857143
Therefore, the sum of 85/75 and 88/56 is 2.705357142857143.

        What is the result of adding 12 over 33 to 49 over 2? Write your answer as a mixed fraction.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
The result of adding 12 over 33 to 49 over 2 can be calculated as follows:

12/33 + 49/2 = 2/33 + 49/2 = 41/33

However, this is not in the simplest form of a mixed fraction. To convert it to a mixed fraction, we divide the numerator by the denominator. The quotient will be the whole number, and the remainder will be the new numerator.

41/33 = 1 + 1/33

So, the result of adding 12 over 33 to 49 over 2 is 1 1/33.

        What is the result of adding two fractions, where each fraction is 78/65?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The result of adding two fractions is the sum of the numerators divided by the sum of the denominators.

So, the result of adding 78/65 and 78/65 is (78+78)/(65+65) = &lt;&lt;(78+78)/(65+65)=156/130&gt;&gt;156/130.

        Calculate the sum of 16/7 and 11/90. Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators of the two fractions, which is 7*90 = &lt;&lt;7*90=630&gt;&gt;630.

Then, we can calculate the new numerators by multiplying the original numerators by the quotient of the new denominator and the original denominator.

16/7 * 630/7 = &lt;&lt;16/7*630/7=1280&gt;&gt;1280
11/90 * 630/90 = &lt;&lt;11/90*630/90=660&gt;&gt;660

The sum of the new numerators is 1280 + 660 = &lt;&lt;1280+660=1940&gt;&gt;1940.

So, the sum of 16/7 and 11/90 is 1940/630 = &lt;&lt;1940/630=3.0555555555555554&gt;&gt;3.0555555555555554.

However, this is not a simplified fraction. To simplify it, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 1940 and 630 is 60.

So, the simplified fraction is 1940/60/630 = &lt;&lt;1940/60/630=3.1666666666666665&gt;&gt;3.1666666666666665.
