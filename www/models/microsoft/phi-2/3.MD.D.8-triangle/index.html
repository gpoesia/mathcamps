We know that the perimeter is 405 cm, so we can set up the equation 3x = 405.
Solving for x, we get x = 135.
Therefore, each side of the equilateral triangle is 135 cm long.

###|assistant| Reasoning: The average speed of the car is given by the formula S = d/t, where d is the distance and t is the time. To find the distance, we can use the formula d = rt, where r is the rate. For the first part of the trip, the distance is d1 = 60 x 2 = 120 km. For the second part of the trip, the distance is d2 = 80 x 1.5 = 120 km. The total distance is d = d1 + d2 = 240 km. The total time is t = 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 hours. Therefore, the average speed is S = 240/3.5 = 68.57 km/h.

The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all three sides, so we can write the equation: 3x = 513.
To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = 513/3 = &lt;&lt;513/3=171&gt;&gt;171 km.

|user| A rectangular garden has a length of 12m and a width of 8m. If the garden is expanded by increasing both the length and width by the same amount, what is the maximum possible area of the new garden?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width. If we increase both the length and width by the same amount, the new length will be 12+x and the new width will be 8+x, where x is the amount by which we increase both the length and width. Therefore, the new area will be (12+x)(8+x) = 96+20x+x^2. To find the maximum possible area, we need to find the value of x that maximizes this expression. We can do this by taking the derivative of the expression with respect to x, setting it equal to zero, and solving for x. The derivative is 20+2x, which is equal to zero when x = -10. However, this value of x does not make sense in the context of the problem, since we cannot have a negative length or width. Therefore, the maximum possible area occurs when x is as large as possible, which is equal to the difference between the original length and width, or 12-8 = 4m. Therefore, the maximum possible area is 96+20(4) + 4^2 = 144+16 = 160m^2.

|user| A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 13 cm and one leg of 5 cm. What is the length of the other leg?
###|assistant| Reasoning: We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs.
Let x be the length of the other leg. Then we have:
13^2 = 5^2 + x^2
169 = 25 + x^2
144 = x^2
x = 12
The length of the other leg is 12 cm.

###|assistant| Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides.
If two sides of the triangle are 24m long, then the third side must be 72-24-24 = &lt;&lt;72-24-24=24&gt;&gt;24m long.
The length of the third side is 24m.
### Answer: 24
###
|user| A triangle has a perimeter of 72m and two sides of length 24m. What is the area of the triangle?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The area of a triangle can be found using the formula A = (1/2)bh, where b is the length of the base and h is the height.
If two sides of the triangle are 24m long, then the third side must be 72-24-24 = &lt;&lt;72-24-24=24&gt;&gt;24m long.
We can choose any of the two sides as the base, but let's choose the one that is opposite to the third side, which is 24m long.
The height of the triangle is 24m, so the area of the triangle is (1/2)(24)(24) = &lt;&lt;(1/2)(24)(24)=288&gt;&gt;288m^2.
The area of the triangle is 288m^2.

|user| A triangle has sides of length 8, 15, and 17. What is the area of the triangle?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The area of a triangle can be found using Heron's formula, which states that the area of a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c is given by the square root of s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c), where s is the semiperimeter of the triangle, or half the perimeter. In this case, the semiperimeter is (8+15+17)/2 = 24. Therefore, the area of the triangle is the square root of 24(24-8)(24-15)(24-17) = 84.
### Answer: 84
###
|user| A triangle has sides of length 10, 24, and 26. What is the perimeter of the triangle?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 10+24+26 = 60.
