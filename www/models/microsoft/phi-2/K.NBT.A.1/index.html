|user| A farmer has a total of 50 cows and chickens on his farm. The number of cows is twice the number of chickens. How many cows and chickens does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of chickens is x. Then the number of cows is 2x.
The total number of animals is x+2x = 3x.
We know that 3x = 50, so x = 50/3 = &lt;&lt;50/3=16.67&gt;&gt;16.67.
Since we can't have a fraction of a chicken, we round down to the nearest whole number.
The farmer has 16 chickens and 2x = 2*16 = &lt;&lt;2*16=32&gt;&gt;32 cows.
### Answer: 16 chickens and 32 cows.

|user| A farmer has a total of 100 chickens and cows on his farm. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows. How many chickens and cows does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of cows is x. Then the number of chickens is 2x.
The total number of animals is x + 2x = 3x.
We know that the total number of animals is 100, so 3x = 100.
Solving for x, we get x = 33.33.
Since we can't have a fraction of an animal, we round down to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, the farmer has 33 cows and 66 chickens.
### Answer: 33 cows and 66 chickens

|user| A store sells two types of shirts: plain and patterned. The store sold a total of 120 shirts, and the ratio of plain shirts to patterned shirts sold was 3:5. How many plain shirts were sold?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The ratio of plain shirts to patterned shirts sold is 3:5, which means that for every 3 plain shirts sold, 5 patterned shirts were sold.
Let x be the number of plain shirts sold. Then, the number of patterned shirts sold is 5x/3.
The total number of shirts sold is x + 5x/3 = 120.
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 3x + 5x = 360.
Combining like terms, we get 8x = 360.
Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 45.
Therefore, 45 plain shirts were sold.
### Answer: 45

Let x be the number of sandals sold. Then, the number of sneakers sold is 2x/3.
The total number of shoes sold is x + 2x/3 = 80.
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 3x + 2x = 240.
Combining like terms, we get 5x = 240.
Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 48.
Therefore, 48 sandals were sold.

|user| A farmer has a total of 100 chickens and ducks. If the number of chickens is twice the number of ducks, how many chickens and ducks does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of ducks is x. Then the number of chickens is 2x.
The total number of chickens and ducks is x + 2x = 3x.
We know that the total number of chickens and ducks is 100, so 3x = 100.
Solving for x, we get x = 100/3 = &lt;&lt;100/3=33.33&gt;&gt;33.33.
Since we can't have a fraction of a chicken or duck, we round down to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, the farmer has 33 ducks and 2*33 = &lt;&lt;2*33=66&gt;&gt;66 chickens.
### Answer: The farmer has 33 ducks and 66 chickens.

The total cost is $2 + $2.25 = $&lt;&lt;2+2.25=4.25&gt;&gt;4.25.
### Answer: The customer pays $4.25.

|user| A farmer has a total of 100 chickens and cows on his farm. If the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, how many cows does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of cows is x. Then, the number of chickens is 2x.
The total number of animals is x + 2x = 3x.
We know that the total number of animals is 100, so 3x = 100.
Solving for x, we get x = 100/3 = &lt;&lt;100/3=33.33&gt;&gt;33.33.
Since we can't have a fraction of a cow, we round down to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, the farmer has 33 cows.

|user| A farmer has a rectangular field that is 20 meters long and 15 meters wide. He wants to increase the area of the field by adding 5 meters to each side. How much will the perimeter of the field increase by?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The original area of the field is 20*15 = &lt;&lt;20*15=300&gt;&gt;300 square meters.
The new length of the field is 20+5+5 = &lt;&lt;20+5+5=30&gt;&gt;30 meters.
The new width of the field is 15+5+5 = &lt;&lt;15+5+5=25&gt;&gt;25 meters.
The new area of the field is 30*25 = &lt;&lt;30*25=750&gt;&gt;750 square meters.
The increase in area is 750-300 = &lt;&lt;750-300=450&gt;&gt;450 square meters.
The increase in perimeter is 2*(30+25) - 2*(20+15) = &lt;&lt;2*(30+25)-2*(20+15)=70&gt;&gt;70 meters.

|user| A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each. If a customer buys 4 apples and 3 oranges, how much does the customer pay?
###|assistant| Reasoning: A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each.
The total cost of 4 apples is 4*0.50 = $&lt;&lt;4*0.50=2&gt;&gt;2.
The total cost of 3 oranges is 3*0.75 = $&lt;&lt;3*0.75=2.25&gt;&gt;2.25.
So, the customer pays $2 + $2.25 = $&lt;&lt;2+2.25=4.25&gt;&gt;4.25.
The customer pays $4.25.

|user| A farmer has a total of 60 cows and chickens on his farm. If the number of cows is twice the number of chickens, how many cows and chickens does he have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of chickens is 'c'. Then the number of cows will be 2c.
The total number of cows and chickens is 60, so we can write the equation as c + 2c = 60.
Simplifying the equation, we get 3c = 60, which means c = 20.
Therefore, the farmer has 20 chickens and 40 cows.
### Answer: 20 chickens, 40 cows

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: If the unicorn has 't' gems and finds 5 more, he will have 't+5' gems.

|user| A farmer has a total of 100 chickens and cows on his farm. If he has twice as many chickens as cows, how many chickens does he have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's call the number of cows 'c'.
We know that the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, so the number of chickens is 2c.
We also know that the total number of chickens and cows is 100, so we can write an equation:
c + 2c = 100
Simplifying, we get 3c = 100.
Solving for 'c', we get 'c' equals 33.33 (rounded to the nearest whole number).
Since we can't have a fraction of a cow, we know that the farmer has 33 cows.
The number of chickens is twice the number of cows, so the farmer has 2*33 = 66 chickens.
### Answer: 66

|user| A farmer has a total of 100 chickens and cows on his farm. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows. How many chickens and cows does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of cows is x. Then the number of chickens is 2x.
The total number of animals is x + 2x = 3x.
We know that 3x = 100, so x = 100/3 = &lt;&lt;100/3=33.33&gt;&gt;33.33.
Since we can't have a fraction of a cow, we round up to the nearest whole number.
The farmer has 33 cows and 2*33 = &lt;&lt;2*33=66&gt;&gt;66 chickens.

|user| A farmer has a total of 100 animals on his farm. Some of them are cows and the rest are chickens. If the total number of legs of the animals is 280, how many cows and chickens does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume that the number of cows is x and the number of chickens is y.
The total number of animals is x+y = 100.
The total number of legs is 4x + 2y = 280.
Solving these two equations, we get x = 40 and y = 60.
Therefore, the farmer has 40 cows and 60 chickens.
### Answer: 40 cows and 60 chickens

|user| A system of equations is given by:
|equation| 2x + 3y = 7
|equation| 4x - y = 5
###|assistant| Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution.
From the second equation, we can express y in terms of x: y = 4x - 5.
Substituting this expression for y in the first equation, we get: 2x + 3(4x - 5) = 7.
Simplifying, we have: 2x + 12x - 15 = 7.
Combining like terms, we get: 14x - 15 = 7.
Adding 15 to both sides, we get: 14x = 22.
Dividing both sides by 14, we get: x = 22/14 = 11/7.
Substituting this value of x back into the second equation, we get: 4(11/7) - y = 5.
Simplifying, we have: 44/7 - y = 5.
Subtracting 44/7 from both sides, we get: -y = 5 - 44/7.
Combining like terms, we get: -y = 35/7 - 44/7.
Simplifying, we have: -y = -9/7.
Multiplying both sides by -1, we get: y = 9/7.
### Answer: 9/7

|user| A system of equations is given by:

Adding this equation to the first equation, we get: (3x + 2y) + (4x - 2y) = 8 + 2.
Simplifying, we have: 7x = 10.
Dividing both sides by 7, we get: x = 10/7.
Substituting this value of x back into the second equation, we</pre>

|user| A system of equations is given by:
|equation| 2x + 3y = 7
|equation| 4x - y = 5
|assistant| Reasoning: Multiplying the second equation by 3, we get:
|equation| 12x - 3y = 15
Adding the two equations, we get:
|equation| 14x = 22
Dividing both sides by 14, we get:
|equation| x = 22/14 = &lt;&lt;22/14=1.5714285714285714&gt;&gt;1.57
Substituting x into the first equation, we get:
|equation| 2(1.57) + 3y = 7
Solving for y, we get:
|equation| 3y = 7 - 3(1.57) = &lt;&lt;7-(3*1.57)=0.14&gt;&gt;0.14
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
|equation| y = 0.14/3 = &lt;&lt;0.14/3=0.04666666666666667&gt;&gt;0.04666666666666667

|user| A system of equations is given by:
|equation| 3x + 2y = 8
|equation| 2x - y = 1
|assistant| Reasoning: Multiplying the second equation by 2, we get:
|equation| 4x - 2y = 2
Adding the two equations, we get:
|equation| 7x = 10
Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
|equation| x = 10/7 = &lt;&lt;10/7=1.4285714285714286&gt;&gt;1.4285714285714286
Substituting x into the first equation, we get:
|equation| 3(1.4285714285714286) + 2y = 8
Solving for y, we get:
|equation| 2y = 8 - 3(1.4285714285714286) = &lt;&lt;8-(3*1.4285714285714286)=0.1428571428</pre>

|user| A butterfly starts her day with 6 flowers and visits r more in the afternoon to get her total daily quota of 10 flowers. If she visits twice as many flowers in the afternoon as she did in the morning, how many flowers did she visit in the afternoon?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let x be the number of flowers the butterfly visited in the morning. Then she visited 2x flowers in the afternoon. The total number of flowers she visited is x+2x=&lt;&lt;x+2x=3x&gt;&gt;3x. We know that 3x=10, so x=&lt;&lt;10/3=3.33&gt;&gt;3.33. However, since the butterfly can only visit whole flowers, she must have visited 3 flowers in the afternoon.

|user| A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits and spends $6.50, how many apples did they buy?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let x be the number of apples and y be the number of oranges. We know that x+y=10 and 0.5x+0.75y=6.5. We can solve for x by multiplying the first equation by 0.5 and subtracting it from the second equation: 0.5x+0.75y-0.5x-0.5y=6.5-5, which simplifies to 0.25y=1. Therefore, y=4. Substituting y=4 into x+y=10 gives x=6. Therefore, the customer bought 6 apples.
