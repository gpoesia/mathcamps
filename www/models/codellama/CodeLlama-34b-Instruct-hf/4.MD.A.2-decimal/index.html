        Maria was driving at an average speed of 11.0 miles per hour for 6.7 hours. After completing this stretch, she immediately continued for another 4.3 miles before stopping. What total distance in miles did Maria cover?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total distance Maria covered, we need to add the distance she traveled at a constant speed and the additional distance she traveled after stopping.

Let's first calculate the distance Maria traveled at a constant speed:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 11.0 miles/hour x 6.7 hours
Distance = 75.3 miles

Now, let's add the additional distance she traveled after stopping:

Distance = 4.3 miles

Total distance = 75.3 miles + 4.3 miles
Total distance = 79.6 miles

Therefore, Maria covered a total distance of 79.6 miles.</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many miles the car travels per gallon of fuel, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the amount of fuel consumed.

Let's use the formula:

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

Miles per gallon = 775.644 miles / 43.6 gallons

Miles per gallon = 17.9 miles/gallon

So, the car travels approximately 17.9 miles per gallon of fuel.</pre>

        Eva has a garden that is 3 meters wide. She decides to extend it by 22.6 meters. After she does this, she has a garden that is as long as the width of the original garden times the total length after the extension. What is now the total area of Eva's garden in square meters?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by finding the length of the original garden. Since the width is 3 meters, the length is also 3 meters.

Now, let's find the length of the extended garden. The extension is 22.6 meters, so the total length of the garden after the extension is:

3 + 22.6 = 25.6 meters

Now, let's find the area of the garden. The area of the original garden is:

3 meters x 3 meters = 9 square meters

The area of the extended garden is:

25.6 meters x 3 meters = 76.8 square meters

So, the total area of Eva's garden is:

9 square meters + 76.8 square meters = 85.8 square meters

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many liters of gas the car will consume in 30 hours, we need to first find out how many hours the car will consume gas in 30 hours.

We can do this by dividing the total number of hours (30) by the number of hours the car consumes gas in one time (41):

30 hours / 41 hours per gas consumption = 0.73 hours

Now, we can multiply the number of hours the car will consume gas in 30 hours by the number of liters of gas the car consumes every 41 hours:

0.73 hours x 615 liters per 41 hours = 449.5 liters

Therefore, the car will consume 449.5 liters of gas in 30 hours.</pre>

We know that Emma had $38 in her wallet before buying the book, and after buying the book, she had $32.6 left. So, the amount she spent on the book is $38 - $32.6 = $5.40.

We also know that the cost of the book is &quot;x&quot;.

x + $5.40 = $38

David earns $46.37 per hour, so his total earnings for the shift would be:

Robert earns $19.96 per hour, so his total earnings for the shift would be:

Adding David's and Robert's earnings together gives us the total amount earned by both of them for the shift:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total amount of money the customer spent, we need to add the cost of the fruits and the cost of the snacks.

The cost of the fruits is 34.2 pounds x $11.01 = $380.52
The cost of the snacks is $7

Therefore, the total amount of money the customer spent is $380.52 + $7 = $387.52.</pre>

Distance = Speed x Time

In this case, the distance traveled by the car is:

        A cyclist pedals for 50.0 kilometers and then takes a break, having covered 38.4 kilometers before stopping. How far did the cyclist pedal after resuming from the break?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the distance the cyclist pedaled after resuming from the break, we need to subtract the distance the cyclist covered before stopping from the total distance the cyclist pedaled.

Let's assume the distance the cyclist pedaled after resuming from the break is x kilometers.

Then, the total distance the cyclist pedaled can be calculated as:

50.0 km (total distance) = 38.4 km (distance before stopping) + x km (distance after resuming)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 50.0 km - 38.4 km = 11.6 km

Therefore, the cyclist pedaled 11.6 kilometers after resuming from the break.</pre>

        In a certain online video game, you start with 18 health points. An enemy hits you and you lose 3.4 health points. For every remaining health point, your character's strength level increases by a 46 points multiplier. How many strength levels will your character have after the enemy hit?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: After the enemy hit, your character has 18 - 3.4 = &lt;&lt;18-3.4=14.6&gt;&gt;14.6 health points remaining.
For every remaining health point, your character's strength level increases by a 46 points multiplier. Therefore, your character's strength level will increase by 14.6 x 46 = &lt;&lt;14.6*46=675.6&gt;&gt;675.6 points.

        A car travels 46.72 miles per hour. After 11.62 hours of driving, the car's gas tank indicates that an additional 41 miles can be covered before the gas runs out. How many miles can the car still travel in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total distance the car can travel, we need to add the distance it has already traveled to the distance it can travel with the remaining gas.

Let's first convert the time from hours to minutes:

11.62 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 701.72 minutes

Now, let's convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute:

46.72 miles/hour x 60 minutes/hour = 2808.32 miles/minute

Now, we can calculate the total distance the car can travel:

Total distance = Distance traveled + Distance remaining
= 46.72 miles/hour x 701.72 minutes + 41 miles
= 3428.32 miles + 41 miles
= 3469.32 miles

Therefore, the car can still travel a total of 3469.32 miles.</pre>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total amount of money Sarah has, we need to first find the total amount of money she earned over the course of her job. We can do this by multiplying the number of days she worked by the amount she earned per day:

38 (dollars per day) x (number of days worked) = total amount of money earned

We are also given that Sarah saved up $24.71 for every $1 she earned. This means that for every dollar she earned, she saved $24.71. So, if she earned $38 per day, she saved $38 x 24.71 = $949.92.

Additionally, Sarah has $11.60 in her piggy bank from before she started working.

Therefore, the total amount of money Sarah has is:

$949.92 (saved from earnings) + $11.60 (from piggy bank) = $961.52

        If the toy that Rachel bought originally cost 45 dollars instead of 5.5 dollars, how much money would Rachel have left after her purchase?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: If the toy originally cost 45 dollars, then Rachel spent 45 dollars on the toy.
She had 48 dollars before she bought the toy, so she has 48 - 45 = &lt;&lt;48-45=3&gt;&gt;3 dollars left after her purchase.

        A cyclist travels 506 kilometers in 11 days. How many kilometers does the cyclist travel each day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many kilometers the cyclist travels each day, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the number of days it took to travel that distance.

Total distance traveled = 506 kilometers
Number of days = 11 days

To find out how many kilometers the cyclist travels each day, we can divide the total distance traveled by the number of days:

506 kilometers / 11 days = 46 kilometers per day

Therefore, the cyclist travels 46 kilometers each day.</pre>
