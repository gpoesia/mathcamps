    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Jerry collects 7 bananas.
Alan helps Jerry collect 4 more bananas.
Total bananas collected by Jerry and Alan: 7 + 4 = &lt;&lt;7+4=11&gt;&gt;11 bananas.
Iso adds 1 more banana to their collection.
Total bananas collected by Jerry, Alan, and Iso: 11 + 1 = &lt;&lt;11+1=12&gt;&gt;12 bananas.
Jerry goes back and finds 7 more bananas.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information we know to create an equation.

Let x be the length of the slide.

We know that Bobby climbed 9 steps to reach the top of the jungle gym, so the length of the climb is 9 steps.

We also know that the slide is 6 steps longer than the climb, so the length of the slide is 9 + 6 = 15 steps.

Therefore, the length of the slide is 15 steps.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information we know to create an equation.

Let x be the length of the ladder.

We know that the slide is 15 steps long, so the length of the slide is 15 steps.

We also know that the ladder is 2 steps longer than the slide, so the length of the ladder is 15 + 2 = 17 steps.

Therefore, the length of the ladder is 17 steps.

Now, let's add the additional distance between the window and the people he needs to rescue:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the number of potions the wizard had at the beginning of the day &quot;x&quot;.

At the end of the day, the wizard has 13 more potions than before, so the total number of potions he has is x + 13.

We know that the wizard had 7 potions in his pantry at the beginning of the day, so the total number of potions he had at the end of the day is x + 7.

Since the wizard had 13 more potions at the end of the day than he did at the beginning, we can set up the equation:

x + 7 = x + 13

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7 = 13

This equation is false, so we know that the information in the problem is incorrect. There must be a mistake in the problem or in the way we interpreted it.
