    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve for q in the equation 82 = ((27 * q) - 17), we need to isolate the variable q.

First, we can add 17 to both sides of the equation to get:

82 + 17 = (27 * q)

This simplifies to:

100 = 27 * q

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 27 to solve for q:

q = 100 / 27

q = 3.7037037037037035

Therefore, the value of q is 3.7037037037037035.</pre>

This simplifies to:

52 = (38 * a)

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 38 to get:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve for g, we need to isolate the variable g on one side of the equation.

First, we can subtract 24 from both sides of the equation to get:

74 = (91g - 24) - 24

This simplifies to:

74 = 91g - 48

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 91 to get:

g = (74 + 48) / 91

This simplifies to:

g = 122 / 91

Therefore, the value of g is 122/91.</pre>
