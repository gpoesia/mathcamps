* The store sells bracelets in collections.
* Each collection consists of identical bracelets.
* Each collection consists of distinct multiples of 11.
* There are 77 bracelets in one collection.

Now, let's think about what this means. If each collection consists of distinct multiples of 11, then the number of bracelets in each multiple must be a multiple of 11.

Let's try to find the smallest multiple of 11 that is greater than or equal to 77. The smallest multiple of 11 that meets this condition is 88.

So, the number of bracelets in each multiple is 88.

Therefore, the answer is:

        In a camping trip, the vertical height of a tent is half of its diagonal length. If the diagonal length of the tent is 14 feet, what is the vertical height of the tent?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the tent. The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal length) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the vertical height and the base).

So, if the diagonal length of the tent is 14 feet, we can write:

14^2 = x^2 + x^2

where x is the vertical height of the tent.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

196 = 2x^2

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

98 = x^2

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

x = 10

So, the vertical height of the tent is 10 feet.</pre>

        A jungle gym has different sections. A total of 77 children are able to play on the gym at one time due to safety restrictions. If each section allows for 7 children to play at once, how many sections does the jungle gym have?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the number of sections in the jungle gym, we need to divide the total number of children who can play at one time by the number of children who can play in each section.

Let's use algebra to solve this problem:

Let x be the number of sections in the jungle gym.

We know that each section allows for 7 children to play at once, so the total number of children who can play at one time is 7x.

We also know that the total number of children who can play at one time is 77.

So, we can set up the equation:

7x = 77

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 77/7

x = 11

So, there are 11 sections in the jungle gym.</pre>

* There are 12 bear footprints in total.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the number of bears that passed through the park. We know that each bear has 6 footprints, so if we divide the total number of footprints by 6, we will get the number of bears.

12 bear footprints / 6 footprints per bear = 2 bears

Therefore, 2 bears passed through the national park.</pre>

If Linda doubles the quantity of model A, she will have 2 dolls of model A.

So, if she currently has x dolls of model A, doubling the quantity will give her 2x dolls of model A.

We know that Linda has a total of 24 dolls in her collection. So, the sum of the quantities of all the different models of dolls she has must equal 24.

Let's say she has y dolls of model B, z dolls of model C, and so on. Then, we can write the equation:

x + y + z + ... = 24

Since doubling the quantity of model A gives her 2x dolls of model A, we can substitute this into the equation:

x + y + z + ... = 24

x + y + z + ... = 24

2x + y + z + ... = 48

Now, we can see that Linda has 2x = 24 - y - z - ... = 12 dolls of model A.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that the number of pillows produced each day is divisible by 11. This means that the number of pillows produced each day can be written as 11x, where x is a positive integer.

We are also given that the number of pillows produced each day is equal to i pillows. Therefore, we can write:

11x = i

Now, we are told that when 11 is divided by i, the result is 6. This means that:

11 / i = 6

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by i:

11 = 6i

Now, we have two equations:

11x = i
11 = 6i

We can solve these equations simultaneously by substituting the value of i from the second equation into the first equation:

11x = 6i

Now, we can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 6:

x = 11 / 6

Therefore, the total number of pillows the manufacturer produces each day is 11 / 6 = 1.83 pillows.</pre>

        Mountain Peak, the famous company for manufacturing bicycles, produces a new model of bicycles every year. Currently, they have 63 bicycles ready for sale. If each gear of the new model can sell exactly 7 bicycles, how many gears are there in the new model of the bicycle?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that each gear can sell exactly 7 bicycles. This means that the total number of bicycles that can be sold is 7 times the number of gears.

We know that there are 63 bicycles ready for sale, so we can set up the following equation:

7g = 63

To solve for g, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

g = 63/7

g = 9

Therefore, there are 9 gears in the new model of the bicycle.</pre>
