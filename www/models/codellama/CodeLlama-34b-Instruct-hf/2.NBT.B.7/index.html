We can now solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of &quot;x&quot;.

        A camera store has 528 cameras in stock. After a holiday sale, they have 414 cameras less in their inventory. How many cameras are left in the store after the sale?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of cameras left in the store after the sale.

We know that the store had 528 cameras in stock before the sale, so the equation for this is:

528 - x = 414

To solve for x, we can add 414 to both sides of the equation:

528 - x + 414 = 414 + x

This simplifies to:

942 = 2 * x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

471 = x

So, there are 471 cameras left in the store after the sale.</pre>

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x represent the number of acoustic guitars in stock.

We know that the total number of guitars in stock is 823, so we can write an equation based on that:

823 = x + 700

We also know that the number of electric guitars is 700, so we can write another equation based on that:

x + 700 = 823

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x by subtracting the two equations:

x + 700 - x = 823 - 700

This simplifies to:

700 = 123

This is clearly incorrect, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's check our work.

The mistake is in the second equation. We wrote:

x + 700 = 823

But this is not correct. The correct equation is:

x + 700 = 1523

Now we can solve for x by subtracting the two equations:

x + 700 - x = 1523 - 700

This simplifies to:

700 = 823

Now we can solve for x:

x = 823 - 700

x = 123

So there are 123 acoustic guitars in stock.</pre>

1. The owner starts with 293 hens in the coop in the morning.
2. In the afternoon, 365 hens are added, so the total number of hens in the coop is now 293 + 365 = &lt;&lt;293+365=658&gt;&gt;658.
3. In the evening, 259 hens are sold, so the number of hens left in the coop is 658 - 259 = &lt;&lt;658-259=399&gt;&gt;399.

Therefore, there would be 399 hens left in the coop.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use a Venn diagram to represent the pizzas.

Let A represent the set of all pizzas made, and let B represent the set of pepperoni pizzas made. Let C represent the set of vegetarian pizzas made.

We know that |A| = 384, since 384 pizzas were made in total.

We also know that |B| = 172, since 172 pepperoni pizzas were made.

We can represent the sets A, B, and C as follows:

A = {all pizzas made}
B = {pepperoni pizzas made}
C = {vegetarian pizzas made}

We can draw a Venn diagram to show the relationship between these sets:

|A| = |B| + |C|

Since 212 pizzas were mistakenly made as vegetarian pizzas instead of pepperoni pizzas, we can represent this as:

|C| = 212

We can now use the equation |A| = |B| + |C| to find the number of pepperoni pizzas made:

|A| = |B| + |C|
384 = 172 + 212

Solving for |B|, we get:

|B| = 384 - 212
|B| = 172

Therefore, there were 172 pepperoni pizzas made.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how much energy from the sun is received on Earth during nighttime every second, we need to subtract the amount of energy that is not received from the total amount of energy radiated by the sun.

Let's first convert the units of energy to be the same:

752 quintillion joules/second = 7.52 x 10^18 joules/second
243 quintillion joules/second = 2.43 x 10^18 joules/second

Now, we can subtract the amount of energy that is not received from the total amount of energy radiated by the sun:

7.52 x 10^18 joules/second - 2.43 x 10^18 joules/second = 5.09 x 10^18 joules/second

        A helicopter company has 631 helicopters in total. Recently, they moved 140 helicopters to a new location. How many helicopters are left at their original location after the move?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of helicopters left at the original location.

We know that the total number of helicopters is 631.

After the move, the number of helicopters at the original location is x.

The number of helicopters moved is 140.

So, we can write an equation:

x + 140 = 631

To solve for x, we can subtract 140 from both sides:

x = 631 - 140

x = 491

Therefore, there are 491 helicopters left at the original location after the move.</pre>

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* There are 35 maple trees in the park.
* The number of pine trees in the park is the same as the number of maple trees.

We can use this information to set up an equation. Let's say the number of pine trees is x. Then, we know that the number of maple trees is also x, since they are the same.

So, we can write an equation:

x + x = 35

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 35

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 17.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a tree, we round up to the nearest whole number:

x = 18

So, there are 18 pine trees and 18 maple trees in the park, for a total of 36 trees.</pre>

        In an observatory, there are 682 functional telescopes. After a month, 391 telescopes were found to be non-functional. How many telescopes remained functional after a month?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use &quot;F&quot; to represent the number of functional telescopes and &quot;N&quot; to represent the number of non-functional telescopes.

At the beginning of the month, there were 682 functional telescopes, so F = 682.

After a month, 391 telescopes were found to be non-functional, so N = 391.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

F + N = 682

where F is the number of functional telescopes at the beginning of the month and N is the number of non-functional telescopes after a month.

We know that F + N = 682 and N = 391, so we can solve for F:

F = 682 - 391 = 291

Therefore, there were 291 functional telescopes remaining after a month.

        After a month of maintenance, 622 non-functional telescopes in the observatory were repaired and brought back to functionality. How many functional telescopes does the observatory have now?

We know that F + N = 682 and N = 391, so we can solve for F:

F = 682 - 391 = 291

Now, let's consider the situation after the maintenance. We know that 622 non-functional telescopes were repaired and brought back to functionality. Therefore, the total number of functional telescopes is:

F + 622 = 291 + 622 = 913

Therefore, the observatory has 913 functional telescopes now.

Therefore, there would be 596 functional telescopes remaining after a month.

        A farmer harvests 874 grapes from his farm. After selling some of the grapes at a local market, he has 748 left. How many grapes did the farmer sell at the market?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's say the farmer sold x grapes at the market.

We know that the total number of grapes the farmer had was 874, so the number of grapes he had after selling some at the market is 874 - x.

We also know that the number of grapes the farmer had after selling some at the market is 748, so we can set up the equation:

874 - x = 748

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

874 = 748 + x

Subtracting 748 from both sides gives us:

286 = x

So, the farmer sold 286 grapes at the market.</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the length of the first rope &quot;x&quot; meters.

We know that the total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope, so the total length of both ropes is x + 377 meters.

We also know that the total length of both ropes is 623 meters, so we can set up the equation:

x + 377 = 623

To solve for &quot;x&quot;, we can subtract 377 from both sides of the equation:

x = 623 - 377

x = 246

So the length of the first rope is 246 meters, and the total length of both ropes is 246 + 377 = 623 meters.</pre>
