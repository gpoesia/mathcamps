        Sarah had 4 candies. After her friend gave her some more, she had a total of 10 candies. How many candies did her friend give her?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Sarah had 4 candies and her friend gave her some more, so the total number of candies she had is 4 + x, where x is the number of candies her friend gave her.

We know that the total number of candies Sarah had after her friend gave her some more is 10, so we can set up the equation:

4 + x = 10

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:

x = 6

So, her friend gave her 6 candies.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's say Barry the bear had x honey jars to begin with. Then, he found 10 more honey jars, so he has a total of x + 10 honey jars. We know that he has a total of 16 honey jars, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 16

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 6

So, Barry the bear had 6 honey jars to begin with.

So, the total energy required for the robot to run for 2 hours is 12 units.

        A jeweler has 10 rings on display. He later adds h more rings to his display and the total number of rings becomes 18. How many rings did the jeweler add?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The jeweler had 10 rings on display initially. He added h more rings to his display, so the total number of rings became 10 + h = 18.
Solving for h, we get:
h = 18 - 10 = 8
Therefore, the jeweler added 8 rings to his display.

        A wind speed increases by 3 miles per hour from the morning to the afternoon. If the wind speed in the afternoon is 10 miles per hour, what was the wind speed in the morning?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The wind speed increased by 3 miles per hour, so we can set up the equation:

Wind speed in the afternoon = Wind speed in the morning + 3 miles per hour

We know that the wind speed in the afternoon is 10 miles per hour, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

10 miles per hour = Wind speed in the morning + 3 miles per hour

Subtracting 3 miles per hour from both sides of the equation gives us:

7 miles per hour = Wind speed in the morning

Therefore, the wind speed in the morning was 7 miles per hour.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's call the number of cucumbers originally on the shelf &quot;x&quot;. We know that 10 more cucumbers were added, so the total number of cucumbers on the shelf is x + 10. We also know that the total number of cucumbers on the shelf is 15, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 15

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 5

So, there were 5 cucumbers originally on the shelf before the addition.

        At a summer beach party, there were 10 beach balls already present. Then, a few more beach balls were added and the total number became 13. How many more beach balls were added at the party?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's say the number of beach balls added to the party was x. Then, the total number of beach balls after the addition would be 10 + x. Since the total number is 13, we can set up the equation:

10 + x = 13

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

x = 3

So, 3 more beach balls were added to the party.</pre>
