        Julian is cutting sections of rope for a project. Each section is 13/2 feet long. He is only able to use 5/7 of each section. How many feet are in the usable part of each section of rope? Calculate this by multiplying 13/2 by 5/7.

13/2 = 6.5 feet
5/7 = 0.7143 feet

So, the usable part of each section of rope is 6.5 feet x 0.7143 feet = 4.5 feet.

Since each box can hold up to 1 bushel of apples, we can calculate the total number of bushels of apples that Julia will use by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of bushels that each box can hold.

Number of boxes = 11
Number of bushels that each box can hold = 1

Total number of bushels of apples = 11 x 1 = 11 bushels

        A baker wants to bake enough cakes for a large party. Each cake requires 5/12 of a kilogram of flour. If the baker needs to bake 16 cakes, how many kilograms of flour will he need? Use the formula s = (16 * (5 / 12)) to calculate the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The formula for calculating the amount of flour needed for baking cakes is:

s = (16 * (5 / 12))

where s is the total amount of flour needed in kilograms.

To calculate the amount of flour needed, we need to first calculate the number of cakes that will be baked. In this case, the baker needs to bake 16 cakes.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of flour needed for each cake. This is done by dividing the total amount of flour needed by the number of cakes that will be baked. In this case, the amount of flour needed for each cake is 5/12 of a kilogram.

Therefore, the total amount of flour needed for 16 cakes is:

s = (16 * (5 / 12))

s = (16 * 0.4167)

s = 6.5 kilograms

Therefore, the baker will need 6.5 kilograms of flour to bake 16 cakes.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the amount of clay in pounds that Albert will need, we need to multiply the number of models he wants to create by the amount of clay he needs for each model.

First, we can simplify the fractions:

* 8/7 = 1
* 17/3 = 5

So, Albert will need 5 models. Each model will require 1 pound of clay, so he will need a total of 5 pounds of clay.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's first calculate the amount Emily spent on Monday:

10 / 19 = 0.5263157894736842

Now, let's calculate the amount Emily spent on Tuesday:

14 / 7 = 2.0000000000000004

So, the amount Emily spent on Tuesday is 2 times more than what she spent on Monday.

Therefore, the amount Emily spent on Tuesday is:

(10 / 19) * (14 / 7) = 0.5263157894736842 * 2 = 1.0526315789473684

        In a class, 10 out of 14 students participated in a school project. Each of those students prepared 8 models for the science fair. Calculate the total number of models prepared for the science fair by multiplying the fraction of students who participated (10/14) with the number of models each student made (8).

The fraction of students who participated in the project is 10/14, which is equal to 0.714.

To find the total number of models prepared for the science fair, we multiply the fraction of students who participated by the number of models each student made.

0.714 x 8 = 5.712

Therefore, the total number of models prepared for the science fair is 5.712.

One day, you noticed that Bear seemed especially energetic and was bringing back the ball 19/14 times faster than usual. Based on this, how many times would Bear bring back the ball in 6 minutes if he continues to fetch at this increased speed?
