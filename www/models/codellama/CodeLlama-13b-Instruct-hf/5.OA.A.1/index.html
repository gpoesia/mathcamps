        A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

1. The company has 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs made.
2. Each pack contains 40 socks, so the total number of socks in all the packs is 93 x 40 = 3720.
3. The company has 2840 - 3720 = -4180 socks left to package.
4. Since each pack contains 40 socks, the company will need to package -4180 / 40 = -104.5 packs to complete all the socks.
5. The company will have a total of 93 + 104.5 = 197.5 packs once all the socks have been packaged.
6. The company received an additional 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues.
7. The company now has 197.5 - 8 = 199 packs.

        A sports store received a huge shipment of 6806 pairs of ice skates. If they evenly distribute the skates over 82 separate stores, how many pairs of ice skates does each store receive?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To find out how many pairs of ice skates each store receives, we need to divide the total number of skates by the number of stores.

Total number of skates = 6806
Number of stores = 82

To divide the skates evenly among the stores, we can use the following formula:

Number of skates per store = Total number of skates / Number of stores

Plugging in the values, we get:

Number of skates per store = 6806 / 82

Number of skates per store = 82

So, each store receives 82 pairs of ice skates.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The store had 79 chairs in stock before the shipment.
The shipment added 9 more chairs, so the store now has 79 + 9 = &lt;&lt;79+9=88&gt;&gt;88 chairs in stock.
The store sold 45 chairs in a single day, so the number of chairs left in the store is 88 - 45 = &lt;&lt;88-45=43&gt;&gt;43 chairs.

Therefore, there are 43 chairs left in the store.</pre>

        At the end of a rainbow, a leprechaun is guarding a pot of gold coins. He adds 39 gold coins to the pot, then another 47. However, while he is distracted, a fairy takes away 8 gold coins from the pot. The new total of coins becomes a code to a magical lock. The code must be enhanced by adding 48 to it only once, and then multiplied by 24. What is the final value to unlock the magical lock?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's start by identifying the initial total number of gold coins in the pot:

39 + 47 = 86

Now, let's subtract the number of gold coins taken away by the fairy:

86 - 8 = 78

Next, we need to add 48 to the new total:

78 + 48 = 126

Finally, we multiply the result by 24:

126 x 24 = 3,084

So, the final value to unlock the magical lock is 3,084.</pre>

The battery life decreases by 36/9 hours when the car's lights are used.
The toy car is run with the lights on for 12 full weeks, each week considered to be 60 hours.

To find the total time the battery lasted, we need to subtract the time the battery life decreased from the total time the battery was used.

Total time = 12 weeks x 60 hours/week = 720 hours

        A train travels at a speed of 68 mph but due to certain restrictions, it had to slow down to 28 mph. Considering the travel time of 21 hours, calculate the impact on the total distance traveled by the train.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The total distance traveled by the train can be calculated by multiplying the speed of the train by the time it took to travel.

Speed = 68 mph
Time = 21 hours

Total distance = Speed x Time
= 68 mph x 21 hours
= 1448 miles

However, due to the restrictions, the train had to slow down to 28 mph. The total distance traveled by the train can be calculated by multiplying the speed of the train by the time it took to travel.

Speed = 28 mph
Time = 21 hours

Total distance = Speed x Time
= 28 mph x 21 hours
= 576 miles

The impact on the total distance traveled by the train is 1448 - 576 = 872 miles.

        A snail travels 66 inches in a day. In addition to that, the snail extracted energy from 704 lettuce leaves over 22 days, allowing it to move an additional inch per day. How far in inches does the snail travel in a day with the additional energy?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The snail's original distance traveled in a day is 66 inches. To find the total distance traveled with the additional energy, we need to add the distance traveled with the additional energy to the original distance traveled.

The snail extracted energy from 704 lettuce leaves over 22 days, allowing it to move an additional inch per day. Therefore, the snail moved an additional 704/22 = &lt;&lt;704/22=31.74&gt;&gt;31.74 inches per day with the additional energy.

The total distance traveled by the snail in a day with the additional energy is the original distance traveled plus the additional distance traveled with the additional energy.

66 + 31.74 = &lt;&lt;66+31.74=97.74&gt;&gt;97.74 inches per day.

Let's first find the total number of good blankets they have:

Total number of good blankets = Total number of blankets - Number of defective blankets
= 13 + 81 - 59
= 132

Now, let's find the total value of the blankets they've sold:

Total value of blankets = Total number of good blankets x Price per blanket
= 132 x (39 x Total number of good blankets + Total number of good blankets)
= 132 x (39 x 132 + 132)
= 132 x 5284

        In a soap manufacturing factory, they create soap in large blocks that are then cut into smaller bars. If each large block can be cut into 1424 bars of soap, but they package the soap in bundles of 16 bars each, how many packages can they make from one large block of soap?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the number of bars that can be cut from one large block of soap &quot;x&quot;.

We know that each large block can be cut into 1424 bars of soap, so x = 1424.

The number of packages that can be made from one large block of soap is equal to the number of bars divided by the number of bars in each package. In this case, the number of bars in each package is 16, so we can divide x by 16 to find the number of packages.

x / 16 = &lt;&lt;1424/16=88&gt;&gt;88 packages

Therefore, the factory can make 88 packages from one large block of soap.</pre>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The fairy sprinkles magical dust at a rate of 4332 milligrams every 76 minutes. To find the amount of magical dust she will sprinkle in 52 minutes, we can use the formula:

Amount = Rate x Time

Where Rate is the rate at which the fairy sprinkles magical dust, and Time is the amount of time she sprinkles it.

In this case, the rate is 4332 milligrams every 76 minutes, and the time is 52 minutes.

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Amount = 4332 milligrams x 52 minutes
Amount = 224,576 milligrams

So, the fairy will sprinkle 224,576 milligrams of magical dust in 52 minutes.
