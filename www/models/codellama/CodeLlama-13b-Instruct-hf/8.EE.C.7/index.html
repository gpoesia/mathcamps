    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve for the variable u in the equation 122 = 92 + 28 * u, we need to isolate the variable u.

First, we can subtract 92 from both sides of the equation to get:

122 - 92 = 28 * u

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 28 to get:

10 = u

Therefore, the value of u is 10.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this equation, we can start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses. We can do this by multiplying the 24 by w, which gives us 24w. Then, we can add 35 to this result, which gives us 24w + 35.

Now, we can set this expression equal to 80, which gives us the equation:

24w + 35 = 80

To solve for w, we can subtract 35 from both sides of the equation, which gives us:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this equation, we can first simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

(38 * a) + 51 = 38a + 51

Now, we can subtract 51 from both sides of the equation to get:

38a = 52

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 38 to get:

a = 52 / 38

Therefore, the value of a is 52 / 38, or approximately 1.37.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve for f in the equation 105 = 28 * f + 8, we can first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get:

105 - 8 = 28 * f

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 28 to get:

105/28 - 8/28 = f

Now, we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation by combining the fractions:

105/28 = 3.75

So, we have:

3.75 - 8/28 = f

Now, we can solve for f by adding 8/28 to both sides of the equation:

3.75 + 8/28 = f

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation by multiplying both sides by 28:

3.75 + 8 = 28f

Now, we can solve for f by dividing both sides of the equation by 28:

f = 3.75 + 8/28

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation by dividing both sides by 28:

f = 3.75 + 1/3

So, the value of f is 3.75 + 1/3.</pre>

        Solve the following linear equation for the unknown variable v:
  
126 = ((21 * v) + 76)
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this linear equation, we need to isolate the variable v. We can do this by subtracting 76 from both sides of the equation, which gives us:

126 = (21 * v)

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 21 to solve for v:

v = 126 / 21

Therefore, the value of v is 126 / 21, which is equal to 6.</pre>

        Solve the following linear equation for g: 
74 = ((91 * g) - 24)
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve for g in the linear equation 74 = ((91 * g) - 24), we need to isolate the variable g.

First, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:

74 = (91g - 24)

Next, we can add 24 to both sides of the equation to get:

98 = (91g)

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 91 to solve for g:

g = 98/91

Therefore, the value of g is 98/91, or approximately 1.07.</pre>
