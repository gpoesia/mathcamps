        You start with 792 milliliters of red paint. After painting a few items, you have 676 milliliters less in the container than at the beginning. How many milliliters of red paint are left in the paint container?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the amount of red paint left in the container &quot;x&quot; milliliters.

We know that the amount of paint used is 676 milliliters, so we can set up the equation:

x - 676 = 792

To solve for &quot;x&quot;, we add 676 to both sides of the equation:

x = 792 + 676

x = 1468

So, there are 1468 milliliters of red paint left in the container.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the number of Golden monkeys in the first area &quot;x&quot;.

We know that there are 108 Golden monkeys in the first area.

We also know that there are 848 more Golden monkeys in the second area.

So, the total number of Golden monkeys in both areas is:

x + 848

We are given that there are 108 Golden monkeys in the first area, so we can set up the equation:

x + 848 = 108 + x

Simplifying the equation:

x + 848 = 108

Subtracting 108 from both sides:

x = 740

So, there are 740 Golden monkeys in both areas of the forest combined.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The number of roses sold was 197.
The number of roses left in the shop at the end of the day is the total number of roses at the start of the day minus the number of roses sold.

        A factory produces 761 lamps a day. After some machinery issues, it dropped to 566 lamps a day. What is the difference in lamp production if the drop happened for two days?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The difference in lamp production is 761 - 566 = &lt;&lt;761-566=195&gt;&gt;195 lamps.
If the drop happened for two days, the difference in lamp production would be 195 x 2 = &lt;&lt;195*2=390&gt;&gt;390 lamps.

He used 535 grams of gold to make more intricate necklaces.
To find out how much gold he has left now, we need to subtract the amount he used from the total amount he had earlier.
986 - 29 - 535 = &lt;&lt;986-29-535=-414&gt;&gt;-414 grams of gold.

        Jack is a professional mountain climber. He has a rope that is 623 meters long. He buys an additional rope to make sure he is prepared for any situation. The total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. What is the total length of the two ropes?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the length of the first rope x.

We know that the total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope, so the total length of both ropes is x + 377.

We also know that the length of the second rope is 623 meters - x, since the second rope is the same length as the first rope but with the first rope removed.

So, the total length of both ropes is:

x + 377 = 623 - x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 377 = 623

Subtracting 377 from both sides, we get:

2x = 246

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 123

So, the length of the first rope is 123 meters, and the length of the second rope is 623 - 123 = 500 meters.

Therefore, the total length of both ropes is 123 + 500 = 623 meters.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The total number of kites after the organizers finished adding the additional kites is the number of kites that remained in the sky plus the number of additional kites brought.

321 + 316 = &lt;&lt;321+316=637&gt;&gt;637 kites were in the sky after the organizers finished adding the additional kites.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Let's say originally, there were actually 855 kites in the sky at the beginning of the kite festival instead of 577. After the same number of 256 kites were taken down, how many kites would have remained in the sky?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The number of kites remaining in the sky is the original number of kites minus the number of kites taken down.

855 - 256 = &lt;&lt;855-256=609&gt;&gt;609 kites remained in the sky.
