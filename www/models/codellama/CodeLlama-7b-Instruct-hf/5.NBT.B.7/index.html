        A full-grown giraffe has an average height of 40.4 feet. If a baby giraffe is 7.34 feet shorter than the full-grown giraffe, then how tall is the baby giraffe?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the height of the baby giraffe, we can use the following equation:

Height of baby giraffe = Height of full-grown giraffe - 7.34 feet

Plugging in the value of the height of the full-grown giraffe (40.4 feet), we get:

Height of baby giraffe = 40.4 feet - 7.34 feet

Height of baby giraffe = 33.06 feet

Therefore, the height of the baby giraffe is 33.06 feet.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many gallons of ice cream the ice cream shop sold each day, we can divide the total number of gallons sold by the number of days:

1878.8 gallons / 44.0 equally profitable days = 42.17 gallons per day

So, the ice cream shop sold approximately 42.17 gallons of ice cream per day.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the number of kilograms of strawberries that the farmer sold &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the farmer had 36.0 kilograms of strawberries to start with, and he sold some of them. So, we can write an equation to represent this:

36.0 - x = 22.6

Now, we need to solve for &quot;x&quot;. We can do this by subtracting 36.0 from both sides of the equation:

x = 22.6 - 36.0

x = -9.4

So, the farmer sold 9.4 kilograms of strawberries.</pre>

        A scientist views a galaxy far away through her binoculars. The distance measured is 4299.12 light years and she views it over 85.3 different scopes. What is the approximate distance in light years that she sees through each scope?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the approximate distance in light years that the scientist sees through each scope, we can use the following formula:

Approximate distance = Total distance / Number of scopes

Plugging in the values given in the problem, we get:

Approximate distance = 4299.12 light years / 85.3 scopes

Approximate distance = 50.06 light years

Therefore, the scientist sees approximately 50.06 light years through each of the 85.3 scopes she uses to view the galaxy.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the information given in the problem to set up an equation.

Let x be the number of pounds of chocolate candies that were sold.

We know that the store had 30.83 pounds of chocolate candies in its stock initially.

We know that the store had 29.0 pounds of chocolate candies left after selling some candies.

We can set up the equation:

30.83 - x = 29.0

Now, we need to solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 30.83 from both sides of the equation:

x = 29.0 - 30.83

x = -6.83

So, -6.83 pounds of chocolate candies were sold.</pre>

        If one minute of observing time with a powerful telescope costs $6.9, how much would it cost for 63.2 minutes of observation time?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the cost of 63.2 minutes of observation time, we need to multiply the cost per minute by the number of minutes.

Cost per minute = $6.9
Number of minutes = 63.2

Total cost = Cost per minute x Number of minutes
Total cost = $6.9 x 63.2
Total cost = $445.36

Therefore, it would cost $445.36 to observe for 63.2 minutes with a powerful telescope that costs $6.9 per minute.</pre>
