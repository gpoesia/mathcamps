To compare these two numbers, we can use the following comparison operators:

* Less than (&lt;)
* Greater than (&gt;)
* Equal to (=)

Using the comparison operators, we can determine which number is greater or less than the other.

For example, we can use the less than operator (&lt;) to determine if 1 is less than 10. If 1 is less than 10, then we can say that 1 is a smaller number than 10.

So, we can say that 1 &lt; 10.

Alternatively, we can use the greater than operator (&gt;) to determine if 10 is greater than 1. If 10 is greater than 1, then we can say that 10 is a larger number than 1.

So, we can say that 10 &gt; 1.

Finally, we can use the equal to operator (=) to determine if 1 and 10 are equal. If 1 and 10 are equal, then we can say that they are the same number.

So, we can say that 1 = 10.

Therefore, we can say that 1 is less than 10, 10 is greater than 1, and 1 and 10 are equal.</pre>
