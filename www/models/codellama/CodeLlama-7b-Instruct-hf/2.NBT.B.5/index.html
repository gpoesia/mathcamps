1. Steve had 10 lamps initially.
2. He bought 9 more lamps from an antique shop.
3. He found a store closing sale and added another 27 lamps to his collection.

To find the total number of lamps Steve has now, we need to add the number of lamps he had initially to the number of lamps he bought from the antique shop, and then add that total to the number of lamps he bought from the store closing sale.

10 + 9 = 19
19 + 27 = 46

        A furniture store has a stock of 78 king size beds. During a big sale, they manage to sell 50 of these beds. How many of these king size beds are left in the store if the number of beds left was duplicated due to a manufacturing error?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  During the big sale, the furniture store sold 50 king size beds, which means they sold 50/78 = &lt;&lt;50/78=0.63&gt;&gt;63% of the total stock.

If the number of beds left was duplicated due to a manufacturing error, then the number of beds left in the store would be twice the number of beds sold during the sale.

Therefore, the number of beds left in the store would be 2(0.63) = &lt;&lt;2*0.63=1.26&gt;&gt;1.26 times the number of beds sold during the sale.

So, the number of king size beds left in the store would be 1.26 times 50 = &lt;&lt;1.26*50=61&gt;&gt;61 king size beds.

        After the 40 crew members abandon Captain Bluebeard's ship, he drafts 25 new scurvy sea dogs from a nearby ruffian-filled tavern. After this recruitment, how many crew members are now aboard Captain Bluebeard's ship?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

After the 40 crew members abandon Captain Bluebeard's ship, he drafts 25 new scurvy sea dogs from a nearby ruffian-filled tavern.

So, 17 (the number of crew members left on the ship) + 25 (the number of new crew members drafted) = &lt;&lt;17+25=42&gt;&gt;42 crew members are now aboard Captain Bluebeard's ship.

        If initially, Captain Bluebeard's pirate ship had 57 crew members and instead of 40, only 32 decided to disembark after the rough storm, how many crew members would be left on Captain Bluebeard's ship then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Captain Bluebeard's pirate ship had 57 crew members at the start of their voyage.

After a rough storm, 32 of them decided to disembark at the next port.

So, 57 - 32 = &lt;&lt;57-32=25&gt;&gt;25 crew members are left on Captain Bluebeard's ship.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

Let's say the number of mice left in the field is x.

After a week, 30 mice were caught by a cat, so the total number of mice that were caught is 30.

The total number of mice that were left in the field is 100 - 30 = 70.

So, the number of mice left in the field is x - 30 = 70.

Therefore, there are 70 mice left in the field.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's say the number of mice left in the field is x.

Before the cat arrived, there were 54 mice in the field, so the total number of mice that were left in the field is 54.

After the cat caught 30 mice, the total number of mice that were left in the field is 54 - 30 = 24.

So, the number of mice left in the field is x - 30 = 24.

* The store had 100 - 78 = &lt;&lt;100-78=22&gt;&gt;22 new smartphones left.
* On the second day, Apple Inc. received an additional shipment of 61 new smartphones.
* The store now has 22 + 61 = &lt;&lt;22+61=83&gt;&gt;83 new smartphones in total.
