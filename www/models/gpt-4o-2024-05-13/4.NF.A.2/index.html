    <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions \( \frac{1}{8} \) and \( \frac{4}{1} \), we need to convert them to a common form or compare their decimal equivalents.

First, let's convert each fraction to its decimal form:
- \( \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \)
- \( \frac{4}{1} = 4.0 \)

Now, we compare the decimal values:
- \( 0.125 \) is less than \( 4.0 \)

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{8} \) is less than \( \frac{4}{1} \).

First, let's simplify \( \frac{6}{8} \):

Now, convert each fraction to its decimal form:
- \( \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \)
- \( \frac{4}{1} = 4.0 \)

Now, we compare the decimal values:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the two fractions \(\frac{9}{8}\) and \(\frac{6}{4}\), we first need to convert them to a common denominator or convert them to decimal form.

\[

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the correct symbol to place between the two fractions \(\frac{8}{9}\) and \(\frac{3}{4}\), we need to compare their values.

One way to compare fractions is to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 4 is 36. We will convert both fractions to have this common denominator.

First, convert \(\frac{8}{9}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 36:
\[
\frac{8}{9} = \frac{8 \times 4}{9 \times 4} = \frac{32}{36}
\]

Next, convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 36:
\[
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 9}{4 \times 9} = \frac{27}{36}
\]

Now, we compare the numerators of the two fractions:
\[
32 \quad \text{and} \quad 27
\]

Since 32 is greater than 27, we have:
\[
\frac{32}{36} &gt; \frac{27}{36}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\frac{8}{9} &gt; \frac{3}{4}

        Now consider a slight variation: 

(6 / 4) _ (6 / 3)

Reassigning the values while maintaining the idea of comparison, frame the above expression into a question. Does the change in denominator affect the outcome as compared to the previous question, (6 / 6) _ (6 / 3)?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first simplify each fraction in the new comparison:

For the fraction \( \frac{6}{4} \):
\[ \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \]

For the fraction \( \frac{6}{3} \):
\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

Now, we compare the simplified values:
\[ 1.5 \quad \text{and} \quad 2 \]

Since 1.5 is less than 2, we use the symbol &quot;&lt;&quot;.

So, the comparison \( \frac{6}{4} \) and \( \frac{6}{3} \) results in:
\[ \frac{6}{4} &lt; \frac{6}{3} \]

To address the question of whether the change in the denominator affects the outcome compared to the previous question \( \frac{6}{6} \) and \( \frac{6}{3} \):

In the previous comparison:
\[ \frac{6}{6} = 1 \]
\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]
\[ 1 &lt; 2 \]

In the new comparison:
\[ \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \]
\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]
\[ 1.5 &lt; 2 \]

In both cases, the fraction on the left is less than the fraction on the right. Therefore, the change in the denominator does not affect the outcome of the comparison; the left fraction remains less than the right fraction.

        Now consider a slight change to the values. Instead of the first fraction being (8 / 4), let's change it to (10 / 4). 

So, we have this comparison:
(10 / 4) _ (5 / 2)

Compare these two fractions as you did before by determining if the first fraction is greater than, equal to, or less than the second fraction.

Convert \(\frac{5}{8}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:

        In the same vein as the previous problem, consider a new comparison: 
(5 / 8) _ (6 / 5).

Which symbol: &lt;, &gt;, or =, correctly complete the comparison? Keep in mind how your answer might change compared to the previous problem because of the different denominator in the second fraction.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine which symbol is appropriate to fill the blank in the comparison \(\frac{5}{8} \_ \frac{6}{5}\), we need to compare the two fractions.

First, let's convert both fractions to a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 5 is 40.

Convert \(\frac{5}{8}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:
\[
\frac{5}{8} = \frac{5 \times 5}{8 \times 5} = \frac{25}{40}
\]

Convert \(\frac{6}{5}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:
\[
\frac{6}{5} = \frac{6 \times 8}{5 \times 8} = \frac{48}{40}
\]

Now we compare the two fractions:
\[
\frac{25}{40} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{48}{40}
\]

Since 25 is less than 48, we have:
\[
\frac{25}{40} &lt; \frac{48}{40}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\frac{5}{8} &lt; \frac{6}{5}
\]

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify both fractions to make the comparison easier.

The fraction \( \frac{5}{10} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:
\[ \frac{5}{10} = \frac{5 \div 5}{10 \div 5} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The fraction \( \frac{6}{6} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:
\[ \frac{6}{6} = \frac{6 \div 6}{6 \div 6} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \]

Now we compare the simplified fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \] and \( 1 \)

Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) is less than \( 1 \), we have:
\[ \frac{1}{2} &lt; 1 \]

Therefore:
\[ \frac{5}{10} &lt; \frac{6}{6} \]

Now, we compare \(\frac{1}{5}\) and \(\frac{2}{3}\). To do this, we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimal form.

Finding a common denominator:
- The least common denominator of 5 and 3 is 15.
- Convert \(\frac{1}{5}\) to a fraction with denominator 15:
  \[
  \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{3}{15}
  \]
- Convert \(\frac{2}{3}\) to a fraction with denominator 15:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{10}{15}
  \]

Now, compare \(\frac{3}{15}\) and \(\frac{10}{15}\):
\[
\frac{3}{15} &lt; \frac{10}{15}

Therefore, \(\frac{1}{5} &lt; \frac{2}{3}\).

Fill in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or = to indicate whether the first fraction is less than, greater than, or equal to the second fraction. What changes when the denominator of the second fraction is 9 instead of 10?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify both fractions:

1. Simplify \( \frac{8}{2} \):
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{9}{9} \):
\[ \frac{9}{9} = 1 \]

Now, compare the two results:
\[ 4 \quad \text{and} \quad 1 \]

Since 4 is greater than 1, we have:
\[ 4 &gt; 1 \]

Therefore:
\[ \frac{8}{2} &gt; \frac{9}{9} \]

When the denominator of the second fraction is 9 instead of 10, the value of the fraction \( \frac{9}{9} \) becomes 1, which is less than the previous value of \( \frac{10}{9} \approx 1.11 \). This makes the comparison even more straightforward, as 4 is clearly greater than 1.

1. Simplify \(\frac{4}{6}\):

2. Simplify \(\frac{6}{10}\):

Next, we compare \(\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\frac{3}{5}\) by finding a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15.

Convert \(\frac{2}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{10}{15}

Convert \(\frac{3}{5}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:

Now, compare \(\frac{10}{15}\) and \(\frac{9}{15}\):

Since \(\frac{6}{5}\) is already in its simplest form, we can compare the two fractions directly by converting them to a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15.

Convert \(\frac{2}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:

Convert \(\frac{6}{5}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:

Now, compare \(\frac{10}{15}\) and \(\frac{18}{15}\):

\frac{4}{6} = \frac{4 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Now we compare \(\frac{3}{2}\) and \(\frac{2}{3}\).

To compare these fractions, we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimal form. Let's convert them to decimal form for simplicity:

\[
\frac{3}{2} = 1.5
\]
\[
\frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667
\]

Since \(1.5 &gt; 0.6667\), we have:
\[
\frac{3}{2} &gt; \frac{2}{3}
\]

Simplifying \(\frac{3}{9}\):
\[

Simplifying \(\frac{4}{6}\):
\[
\frac{4}{6} = \frac{4 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{2}{3}

Now we compare \(\frac{1}{3}\) and \(\frac{2}{3}\).

Since both fractions have the same denominator, we can directly compare the numerators:

Thus, \(\frac{1}{3} &lt; \frac{2}{3}\).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the two fractions \(\frac{9}{6}\) and \(\frac{6}{8}\), we first simplify each fraction.

1. Simplify \(\frac{9}{6}\):
   \[
   \frac{9}{6} = \frac{3 \times 3}{3 \times 2} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

2. Simplify \(\frac{6}{8}\):
   \[
   \frac{6}{8} = \frac{2 \times 3}{2 \times 4} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

Now, we compare \(\frac{3}{2}\) and \(\frac{3}{4}\).

To compare these fractions, we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimal form.

- Converting to decimal form:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5
  \]
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
  \]

Since \(1.5 &gt; 0.75\), we have:
\[
\frac{3}{2} &gt; \frac{3}{4}
\]

Thus, \(\frac{9}{6} &gt; \frac{6}{8}\).

        Compare the values of the following fractions by filling in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =. 

(6 / 10) _ (9 / 10)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions \(\frac{6}{10}\) and \(\frac{9}{10}\), we observe that they have the same denominator. When fractions have the same denominator, we can compare their numerators directly.

The numerator of \(\frac{6}{10}\) is 6, and the numerator of \(\frac{9}{10}\) is 9. Since 6 is less than 9, it follows that:

\[
\frac{6}{10} &lt; \frac{9}{10}
\]

        Now, consider if the fraction had been different. Compare the following fractions:

(1 / 10) _ (9 / 10)

How would your answer change from the previous question where you compared (6 / 10) and (9 / 10)?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions \(\frac{1}{10}\) and \(\frac{9}{10}\), we again observe that they have the same denominator. When fractions have the same denominator, we can compare their numerators directly.

The numerator of \(\frac{1}{10}\) is 1, and the numerator of \(\frac{9}{10}\) is 9. Since 1 is less than 9, it follows that:

\[
\frac{1}{10} &lt; \frac{9}{10}
\]

This comparison is similar to the previous one where we compared \(\frac{6}{10}\) and \(\frac{9}{10}\). In both cases, the fraction with the smaller numerator is less than the fraction with the larger numerator.

        Compare the two fractions by filling in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =.

(6 / 8) _ (4 / 9)
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions \(\frac{6}{8}\) and \(\frac{4}{9}\), we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimal form.

First, let's simplify \(\frac{6}{8}\):
\[
\frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Next, we convert both fractions to decimal form:
\[
\frac{3}{4} = 0.75
\]
\[
\frac{4}{9} \approx 0.4444
\]

Now, we compare the decimal values:
\[
0.75 &gt; 0.4444
\]

Thus, \(\frac{3}{4} &gt; \frac{4}{9}\).
