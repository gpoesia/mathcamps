    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of 24.429 - 13.777, we perform the subtraction as follows:

```
  24.429

Starting from the rightmost digit:
- 9 - 7 = 2
- 2 - 7 (we need to borrow 1 from the next column) = 12 - 7 = 5
- 4 - 7 (we need to borrow 1 from the next column) = 14 - 7 = 7
- 3 - 3 = 0
- 2 - 1 = 1

So, the result of the subtraction is:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we already calculated the result of 24.429 - 13.777, which is 10.652.

Now, we need to subtract 4.11 from 10.652. To do this, we align the decimal points and perform the subtraction:

```
  10.652

Starting from the rightmost digit:
- 2 - 0 = 2
- 5 - 1 = 4
- 6 - 1 = 5
- 0 - 4 (we need to borrow 1 from the next column) = 10 - 4 = 6

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of 61.571 - 26.25, we need to perform the subtraction operation.

First, align the numbers by their decimal points:

```
  61.571
- 26.250
```

Now, subtract each column starting from the rightmost digit:

1. Subtract the thousandths place: 1 - 0 = 1
2. Subtract the hundredths place: 7 - 5 = 2
3. Subtract the tenths place: 5 - 2 = 3
4. Subtract the units place: 1 - 6 (since 1 is smaller than 6, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place)
5. After borrowing, the tens place becomes 5 and the units place becomes 11. Now, 11 - 6 = 5
6. Subtract the tens place: 5 - 2 = 3

Putting it all together, we get:

```
  97.13
- 60.07
-------
```

Starting from the rightmost digit:
- 3 - 7: Since 3 is less than 7, we need to borrow 1 from the next digit. This makes it 13 - 7 = 6.
- 0 (after borrowing) - 0 = 0

Starting from the rightmost digit:

1. Subtract the thousandths place: \( 0 - 7 \). Since 0 is less than 7, we need to borrow from the hundredths place.
2. Borrow 1 from the hundredths place (making it 9), and the thousandths place becomes 10. Now, \( 10 - 7 = 3 \).

Next, the hundredths place:

3. Subtract the hundredths place: \( 9 - 5 = 4 \).

Next, the tenths place:

4. Subtract the tenths place: \( 0 - 7 \). Since 0 is less than 7, we need to borrow from the units place.
5. Borrow 1 from the units place (making it 8), and the tenths place becomes 10. Now, \( 10 - 7 = 3 \).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we take the sum of 4.508 and 3.253 from the previous problem, which is 7.761.

Next, we add 65.0 to this sum:

Aligning the decimal points and adding the numbers column by column:

\[
\begin{array}{r}

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of subtracting 5.2 from 73.195, we perform the following calculation:

First, align the numbers by their decimal points:

\[ 
\begin{array}{r}
  73.195 \\
-  5.200 \\
\hline

\]

Now, subtract each column starting from the rightmost digit:

1. Subtract the thousandths place: \( 5 - 0 = 5 \)
2. Subtract the hundredths place: \( 9 - 0 = 9 \)
3. Subtract the tenths place: \( 1 - 2 \). Since 1 is less than 2, we need to borrow 1 from the units place of 73, making it 71 and converting the 1 in the tenths place to 11. Now, \( 11 - 2 = 9 \).
4. Subtract the units place: \( 2 - 5 \). Since 2 is less than 5, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place of 71, making it 6 and converting the 2 in the units place to 12. Now, \( 12 - 5 = 7 \).
5. Subtract the tens place: \( 6 - 0 = 6 \).

Next, add the digits in the tenths place:

Since 18 is more than 10, we write down 8 and carry over 1 to the units place.

Now, add the digits in the units place, including the carry-over:

Let's perform the subtraction step by step:

1. Subtract the digits in the hundredths place:
\[ 6 - 4 = 2 \]

2. Subtract the digits in the tenths place:
\[ 8 - 9 \]
Since 8 is less than 9, we need to borrow 1 from the units place. This makes the 8 become 18 and the units place digit (6) become 5.
\[ 18 - 9 = 9 \]

3. Subtract the digits in the units place:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

4. Subtract the digits in the tens place:

Starting from the rightmost column:

Next, we subtract 23.17 from 97.154. To do this, we align the decimal points and perform the subtraction column by column:

```
  97.154
- 23.170
---------
```

Starting from the rightmost column:
- 4 - 0 = 4
- 5 - 7 (we need to borrow 1 from the next column) = 15 - 7 = 8

Now, subtract each column starting from the rightmost digit:

1. Subtract the thousandths place: \(2 - 0 = 2\)
2. Subtract the hundredths place: \(4 - 0 = 4\)
3. Subtract the tenths place: \(0 - 4\) (since 0 is less than 4, we need to borrow 1 from the units place of 78, making it 70 and the tenths place becomes 10)
   \[ 10 - 4 = 6 \]
4. Subtract the units place: \(7 - 9\) (since 7 is less than 9, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place of 78, making it 60 and the units place becomes 17)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the result of the subtraction \( 8.65 - 1.397 \). As calculated previously, the result is \( 7.253 \).

Now, we need to add this result to another identical subtraction, which means we are adding \( 7.253 \) to itself:
\[ 7.253 + 7.253 \]

Let's perform the addition step by step:
```
  7.253

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of subtracting \( 1.397 \) from \( 36 \), we need to perform the subtraction step by step.

First, align the numbers by their decimal points:
```
  36.000
-  1.397
```

Now, subtract each column starting from the rightmost digit:
- In the thousandths place: \( 0 - 7 \) is not possible, so we need to borrow from the hundredths place.
- In the hundredths place: \( 0 - 9 \) is not possible, so we need to borrow from the tenths place.
- In the tenths place: \( 0 - 3 \) is not possible, so we need to borrow from the units place.
- In the units place: \( 6 - 1 = 5 \) (after borrowing, it becomes \( 5 - 1 \)).
- In the tens place: \( 3 - 0 = 3 \).

After borrowing and performing the subtraction:

Now, subtract each column starting from the rightmost digit:

1. Subtract the hundredths place: \(0 - 6\). Since 0 is less than 6, we need to borrow 1 from the tenths place.
2. The tenths place becomes 7 (since we borrowed 1), and the hundredths place becomes 10.

        Suppose instead of starting with 92.756, you started with the same amount and subtracted 38. How much would you have left now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much is left after subtracting 38 from 92.756, we perform the subtraction:

\[ 92.756 - 38 \]

First, we need to align the numbers properly by their decimal points. Since 38 is a whole number, we can write it as 38.000 to match the decimal places of 92.756:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
  92.756 \\
- 38.000 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Now, we subtract each column starting from the rightmost digit:
- \(6 - 0 = 6\)
- \(5 - 0 = 5\)
- \(7 - 0 = 7\)
- \(2 - 8\) requires borrowing. Borrow 1 from the 9 (making it 8), so \(12 - 8 = 4\)
- \(8 - 3 = 5\)

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
  92.756 \\
- 38.000 \\
\hline
  54.756 \\

Next, we subtract 77.217 from the sum we just calculated:

To perform this subtraction, we align the decimal points and add a zero to the end of 82.20 to make it 82.200 for easier calculation:

Now, subtract each column starting from the rightmost digit:

1. Subtract the thousandths place:

   Borrowing 1 from the units place:
   \[
   11 - 2 = 9

4. Subtract the units place:
   \[
   1 - 7 \quad \text{(we need to borrow from the tens place)}

\[
9 + 36.61
\]

First, we can rewrite 9 as 9.00 to align the decimal places:

\[
9.00 + 36.61
\]

Now, add the digits in the hundredths place:

\[
0 + 1 = 1
\]

Next, add the digits in the tenths place:

\[
0 + 6 = 6
\]

Then, add the digits in the units place:

\[
9 + 6 = 15 \quad \text{(write down 5 and carry over 1)}
\]

Finally, add the digits in the tens place, including the carry-over:

\[
0 + 3 + 1 = 4
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
9.00 + 36.61 = 45.61
