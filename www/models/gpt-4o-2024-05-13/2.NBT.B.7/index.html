        In one month, a fireplace company sold 278 traditional wood-burning fireplaces. In the same month, they also sold 305 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones. How many gas fireplaces did the company sell?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of gas fireplaces sold, we start by noting that the company sold 278 traditional wood-burning fireplaces.

The problem states that the company sold 305 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones. Therefore, we need to add 305 to the number of traditional fireplaces sold to find the number of gas fireplaces sold.

Let's calculate it step-by-step:

1. Number of traditional fireplaces sold: 278
2. Additional gas fireplaces sold: 305

Now, we add these two numbers together:

\[ 278 + 305 = 583 \]

Thus, the company sold 583 gas fireplaces.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of fireplaces sold in one month, we need to add the number of traditional wood-burning fireplaces and the number of gas fireplaces sold.

From the previous information:
- The company sold 278 traditional wood-burning fireplaces.
- The company sold 583 gas fireplaces.

Now, we add these two quantities together:

\[ 278 + 583 = 861 \]

Therefore, the total number of fireplaces sold in one month is 861.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of gas fireplaces sold in the revised scenario, we start with the number of traditional wood-burning fireplaces sold, which is 278.

The problem now states that the company sold 68 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones. Therefore, we need to add 68 to the number of traditional fireplaces sold to find the number of gas fireplaces sold.

Let's calculate it step-by-step:

1. Number of traditional fireplaces sold: 278
2. Additional gas fireplaces sold: 68

Now, we add these two numbers together:

\[ 278 + 68 = 346 \]

Thus, the company sold 346 gas fireplaces in the revised scenario.

Next, we need to find out how many skateboards will be left in stock after this month's sales. The store originally stocked 685 skateboards.

Subtract the number of skateboards sold this month from the original stock:
\[ 685 - 417 \]

Perform the subtraction:
\[ 685 - 417 = 268 \]

Thus, the store will have 268 skateboards in stock after this month's sales.

John had 671 dollars in the morning. By the evening, he had 431 dollars less than what he had in the morning.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how much money John had left in his wallet in the evening after spending some money.

John had 671 dollars in the morning and was left with 431 dollars less by the evening:
\[ 671 - 431 = 240 \]

So, John had 240 dollars in his wallet in the evening.

The following day, John deposits another 709 dollars into his wallet. To find out how much money he has after the deposit, we add the 709 dollars to the 240 dollars he had left:
\[ 240 + 709 = 949 \]

Therefore, after the deposit, John has 949 dollars in his wallet.

2. Subtract the number of incorrectly categorized species that were removed:
   \[
   558 - 66 = 492

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many more milliliters of paint Jackson used for his next painting compared to the sky scenery, we need to subtract the amount of paint used for the sky scenery from the amount used for the next painting.

The amount of paint used for the sky scenery is 336 milliliters.
The amount of paint used for the next painting is 747 milliliters.

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 747 \, \text{milliliters} - 336 \, \text{milliliters} = 411 \, \text{milliliters} \]

So, Jackson used 411 more milliliters of paint for his next painting.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many milliliters of paint Jackson has left after subtracting the amount used for the first painting, we need to know the amount of paint used for the first painting. From the previous information, we know that Jackson used 336 milliliters of paint for the sky scenery, which we assume is the first painting.

Jackson has 361 milliliters of paint left after the third painting. We need to subtract the amount of paint used for the first painting (336 milliliters) from this remaining amount.

Perform the subtraction:
\[ 361 \, \text{milliliters} - 336 \, \text{milliliters} = 25 \, \text{milliliters} \]

        Your new card deck begins with 346 cards. After a few games, you realize you have lost 47 cards. How many cards are left in your deck now?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many cards are left in the deck, we need to subtract the number of lost cards from the initial number of cards.

Initial number of cards: 346
Number of lost cards: 47

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 346 - 47 \]

First, subtract the units place:
\[ 6 - 7 = -1 \]
Since we cannot have a negative result in the units place, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place. This makes the 4 in the tens place become 3, and the 6 in the units place becomes 16.

Now, subtract the units place again:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, subtract the tens place:
\[ 3 - 4 = -1 \]
Again, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place. This makes the 3 in the hundreds place become 2, and the 3 in the tens place becomes 13.

Now, subtract the tens place again:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]

Finally, subtract the hundreds place:
\[ 2 - 0 = 2 \]

Total weight of the sand = 336 pounds + 268 pounds

Now, let's perform the addition:

Total weight of the sand after the addition: 336 pounds + 268 pounds = 604 pounds

Now, the playground management decided to remove an amount of sand equal to the initial weight, which is 336 pounds.

Total weight of the sand after removal = Total weight after addition - Initial weight
Total weight of the sand after removal = 604 pounds - 336 pounds

        After counting all his red blocks, Mike realized there are 63 blue blocks as well. How many building blocks does Mike have in total now, if you combine both his red and blue blocks?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of building blocks Mike has, we need to add the number of red blocks to the number of blue blocks.

From the previous problem, we know Mike has 485 red blocks.
He also has 63 blue blocks.

Now, we add these two quantities together:
\[ 485 + 63 \]

First, we add the units place:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Next, we add the tens place:
\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \]
We write down 4 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.

Finally, we add the hundreds place:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

So, the total number of building blocks Mike has now is:
\[ 548 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of red blocks Mike has now with the updated information, we need to add the number of red blocks he originally had to the number of red blocks he found in the older box.

Mike originally had 416 red blocks.
He found an additional 266 red blocks.

Now, we add these two quantities together:
\[ 416 + 266 \]

First, we add the units place:
\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]
We write down 2 and carry over 1 to the tens place.

Next, we add the tens place:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many kilograms of cheese the producer has left this month, we need to subtract the amount of cheese lost due to damage and spoilage from the total amount produced.

Total cheese produced: 218 kilograms
Cheese lost due to damage and spoilage: 40 kilograms

Now, subtract the lost cheese from the total produced:
\[ 218 \, \text{kg} - 40 \, \text{kg} = 178 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, the factory requests an additional 303 million gallons.

We add these amounts together:

First, add the day and night amounts:

However, she was a bit tired and was unable to count exactly how many she did.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's denote the number of pirouettes the ballerina did after dinner as \( x \).

From the previous problem, we know that the total number of pirouettes she did before dinner is 575.

According to the problem, the total number of pirouettes she did for the day (including after dinner) is 314 less than if she had doubled the number of pirouettes she performed before dinner.

First, let's calculate what doubling the number of pirouettes before dinner would be:
\[ 2 \times 575 = 1150 \]

The total number of pirouettes for the day is 314 less than this doubled amount:
\[ 1150 - 314 = 836 \]

So, the total number of pirouettes for the day is 836. Since she did 575 pirouettes before dinner, the number of pirouettes she did after dinner is:
\[ 836 - 575 = 261 \]

        A TV network has 294 scheduled ads to play throughout the day. Then, they receive a request to play an extra 78 ads. How many ads in total will be played on the TV network?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of ads that will be played on the TV network, we need to add the initially scheduled ads to the extra ads requested.

Initially scheduled ads: 294
Extra ads requested: 78

Total ads = Initially scheduled ads + Extra ads requested
Total ads = 294 + 78

Now, let's perform the addition:

294
+ 78
-----
372

So, the total number of ads that will be played on the TV network is 372.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new total number of ads after doubling, we start with the total number of ads previously calculated and then multiply by 2.

Previously calculated total ads: 372

New total ads = 2 * 372

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

2 * 372 = 744

So, the total number of ads that will be played on the TV network after doubling is 744.

Total ads = Initially scheduled ads + Extra ads requested
Total ads = 157 + 78

Now, let's perform the addition:

157

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of people who attended both Lucy's and Michael's parties, we need to add the number of people at each party.

From the previous problem, we know that Lucy's party had a total of 214 people.

Since Michael's party had the same number of children and adults as Lucy's party, Michael's party also had 214 people.

To find the total number of people who attended both parties, we add the number of people at Lucy's party and the number of people at Michael's party:
\[ 214 + 214 \]

Let's perform the addition:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total number of stars now known to exist in the galaxy after eliminating the repeated observations, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add the number of newly discovered stars to the number of previously known stars.
2. Subtract the number of stars that were already accounted for in previous observations.

Given:
- Number of previously known stars = 373
- Number of newly discovered stars = 540

First, we add the newly discovered stars to the previously known stars:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many skateboards the store sold in November, we need to subtract the number of skateboards sold less in November from the number sold in October.

First, we know the store sold 603 skateboards in October. In November, they sold 298 fewer skateboards than in October. Therefore, we calculate the number of skateboards sold in November as follows:

\[ \text{Number of skateboards sold in November} = \text{Number of skateboards sold in October} - 298 \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of skateboards sold in November} = 603 - 298 \]

Now, perform the subtraction:

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the actual number of skateboards sold in November after accounting for the returns, we need to subtract the number of returned skateboards from the number of skateboards sold in November.

From the previous calculation, we know the store sold 305 skateboards in November. Two skateboards were returned due to defects. Therefore, we calculate the actual number of skateboards sold in November as follows:

\[ \text{Actual number of skateboards sold in November} = \text{Number of skateboards sold in November} - \text{Number of returned skateboards} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Actual number of skateboards sold in November} = 305 - 2 \]

        Based on the previous scenarios, if the skateboard store had initially sold 457 fewer skateboards in October, instead of 298 fewer, how many skateboards would the store have sold in November then?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many skateboards the store would have sold in November if they had sold 457 fewer skateboards in October, we need to adjust the initial number of skateboards sold in October and then calculate the number sold in November.

First, we know the original number of skateboards sold in October was 603. If the store had sold 457 fewer skateboards in October, we calculate the new number of skateboards sold in October as follows:

\[ \text{New number of skateboards sold in October} = 603 - 457 \]

Perform the subtraction:

\[ 603 - 457 = 146 \]

Now, we need to determine how many skateboards were sold in November, given that in November they sold 298 fewer skateboards than in October. Using the new number of skateboards sold in October (146), we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of skateboards sold in November} = 146 - 298 \]

Since 298 is greater than 146, the result will be negative, indicating that the store would have sold a negative number of skateboards, which is not possible in a real-world scenario. Therefore, the store would have sold 0 skateboards in November.
