        The perimeter of a rectangular swimming pool is 324 meters. The length of the pool is 83 meters. What is the width of the pool?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the width of the pool, we start by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ P = 2L + 2W \]

where \( P \) is the perimeter, \( L \) is the length, and \( W \) is the width. We are given:

\[ P = 324 \, \text{meters} \]
\[ L = 83 \, \text{meters} \]

Substituting these values into the perimeter formula, we get:

\[ 324 = 2(83) + 2W \]

First, calculate \( 2 \times 83 \):

\[ 2 \times 83 = 166 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 324 = 166 + 2W \]

Next, isolate \( 2W \) by subtracting 166 from both sides:

\[ 324 - 166 = 2W \]
\[ 158 = 2W \]

Finally, solve for \( W \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ W = \frac{158}{2} \]
\[ W = 79 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the length of the other side of the rectangle, we start by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

We are given:
- The perimeter \( P = 194 \) cm
- The length of one side \( \text{length} = 49 \) cm

Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \). Plugging the known values into the perimeter formula, we get:

\[ 194 = 2 \times (49 + w) \]

First, we simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ 97 = 49 + w \]

Next, we solve for \( w \) by subtracting 49 from both sides:

\[ w = 97 - 49 \]
\[ w = 48 \]

Thus, the length of the other side of the rectangle is 48 cm.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the other side of the rectangle, we start by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

First, we substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:

\[ 52 = 2 \times (L + 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( L \):

1. Divide both sides by 2 to isolate the term with \( L \):

\[ 26 = L + 4 \]

2. Subtract 4 from both sides to solve for \( L \):

\[ L = 26 - 4 \]
\[ L = 22 \]

So, the length of the other side is 22 meters.

where \( P \) is the perimeter, \( L \) is the length of the longer side, and \( W \) is the width (shorter side).

Given:
- Perimeter \( P = 282 \) meters
- Length \( L = 71 \) meters

We can substitute these values into the perimeter formula:

\[ 282 = 2 \times (71 + W) \]

First, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate the sum of the length and width:

\[ 141 = 71 + W \]

Next, solve for \( W \) by subtracting 71 from both sides:

\[ W = 141 - 71 \]
\[ W = 70 \]

Thus, the length of the shorter side is 70 meters.

Given:
- Perimeter = 236 cm
- Side 1 = 69 cm
- Side 2 = 50 cm
- Side 3 = 39 cm

Let \( \text{Side 4} \) be \( x \). Then we have:

\[ 236 = 69 + 50 + 39 + x \]

First, we add the known side lengths:

\[ 69 + 50 + 39 = 158 \]

Now, substitute this sum back into the equation:

\[ 236 = 158 + x \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 158 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 236 - 158 \]

\[ x = 78 \]

Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 78 cm.

The known side lengths are:
\[ 37 \text{ cm}, 14 \text{ cm}, \text{ and } 73 \text{ cm} \]

Let the unknown side length be \( x \). The sum of all the sides is:

\[ P = 4s \]

where \( s \) is the length of one side of the square.

Given that the perimeter \( P \) is 124 meters, we can set up the equation:

        A rectangular field has a perimeter of 336 feet. The length of one of its sides is 79 feet. What is the length of the opposite side?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the opposite side of the rectangular field, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given:
- The perimeter \( P \) is 336 feet.
- The length of one side is 79 feet.

Let's denote the length by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). We know that:

\[ L = 79 \text{ feet} \]

Substituting the known values into the perimeter formula:

\[ 336 = 2 \times (79 + W) \]

First, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate the sum of the length and width:

\[ 168 = 79 + W \]

Next, solve for \( W \) by subtracting 79 from both sides:

\[ W = 168 - 79 \]
\[ W = 89 \]

Therefore, the length of the opposite side (which is the width in this context) is 89 feet.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the width of the rectangle, we start by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ P = 2L + 2W \]

where \( P \) is the perimeter, \( L \) is the length, and \( W \) is the width. We are given:

\[ P = 138 \text{ feet} \]
\[ L = 46 \text{ feet} \]

Substituting these values into the perimeter formula, we get:

\[ 138 = 2(46) + 2W \]

First, calculate \( 2 \times 46 \):

\[ 2 \times 46 = 92 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 138 = 92 + 2W \]

Next, subtract 92 from both sides to isolate \( 2W \):

\[ 138 - 92 = 2W \]
\[ 46 = 2W \]

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the width of the rectangular field, we start by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Given:
- Perimeter = 174 meters
- Length = 65 meters

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ 174 = 2 \times (65 + \text{Width}) \]

First, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate the sum of the length and width:

\[ \frac{174}{2} = 65 + \text{Width} \]

\[ 87 = 65 + \text{Width} \]

Next, subtract 65 from both sides to solve for the width:

\[ 87 - 65 = \text{Width} \]

\[ 22 = \text{Width} \]

\[ 242 = 2 \times (97 + W) \]

First, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate the sum of the length and width:

\[ 121 = 97 + W \]

Next, we solve for \( W \) by subtracting 97 from both sides:

\[ W = 121 - 97 \]

\[ W = 24 \]

Thus, the length of the other side of the rectangle is 24 meters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the fourth side of the quadrilateral, we need to subtract the lengths of the known three sides from the total perimeter.

Given:
- Perimeter of the quadrilateral = 157 meters
- Length of the first side = 97 meters
- Length of the second side = 5 meters
- Length of the third side = 30 meters

First, we sum the lengths of the three known sides:
\[ 97 + 5 + 30 = 132 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total perimeter to find the length of the fourth side:
\[ 157 - 132 = 25 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate the sum of the length and width:

Now, we solve for the width by subtracting 47 from both sides:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the fourth side of the quadrilateral, we need to use the information about the perimeter. The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

Given:
- Length of the first side = 1 meter
- Length of the second side = 54 meters
- Length of the third side = 9 meters
- Total perimeter = 81 meters

Let the length of the fourth side be \( x \) meters.

The equation for the perimeter is:
\[ 1 + 54 + 9 + x = 81 \]

First, we sum the known side lengths:
\[ 1 + 54 + 9 = 64 \]

Now, we substitute this sum back into the equation:
\[ 64 + x = 81 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 64 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 81 - 64 \]
\[ x = 17 \]

Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 17 meters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each of the other two sides of the rectangular playground, we start by noting that the total length of the fence is the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

We know the total perimeter is 166 meters, and two of the sides are each 19 meters. Let's denote the unknown length of the other two sides as \( w \) (width).

The perimeter equation can be written as:

\[ 166 = 2 \times (19 + w) \]

First, we simplify the equation:

\[ 166 = 2 \times 19 + 2 \times w \]
\[ 166 = 38 + 2w \]

Next, we isolate \( 2w \) by subtracting 38 from both sides:

\[ 166 - 38 = 2w \]
\[ 128 = 2w \]

Now, we solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ w = \frac{128}{2} \]
\[ w = 64 \]
