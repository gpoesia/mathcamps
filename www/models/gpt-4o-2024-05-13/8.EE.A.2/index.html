        A child builds a sandcastle in a sandbox. The sandbox has the shape of a cubic box with 512 cubic feet of sand. What is the length of each side of the sandbox in feet?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of the cubic sandbox, we need to determine the cube root of the volume. The volume of the sandbox is given as 512 cubic feet.

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is:
\[ V = s^3 \]

Given \( V = 512 \) cubic feet, we need to solve for \( s \):
\[ s^3 = 512 \]

To find \( s \), we take the cube root of both sides:
\[ s = \sqrt[3]{512} \]

We can determine the cube root of 512 by recognizing that:
\[ 512 = 8 \times 8 \times 8 = 8^3 \]

Thus:
\[ \sqrt[3]{512} = 8 \]

Therefore, the length of each side of the sandbox is 8 feet.

We need to find \( s \) such that:
\[ s^3 = 729 \]

To find \( s \), we take the cube root of 729:

We know that:
\[ 9 \times 9 \times 9 = 729 \]

Therefore:
\[ \sqrt[3]{729} = 9 \]

So, the length of each side of the fireplace is 9 feet.

where \( s \) is the length of each side. Given that the volume \( V \) is 1000 cubic meters, we can set up the equation:

\[ s^3 = 1000 \]

To find \( s \), we take the cube root of both sides:

\[ s = \sqrt[3]{1000} \]

We know that:

\[ 10^3 = 1000 \]

Therefore:

\[ \sqrt[3]{1000} = 10 \]

So, the length of each side of the barn is 10 meters.

Given that the volume of the cuboid (which is a cube in this case) is 64 km³, we can use the formula for the volume of a cube:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( V \) is the volume and \( s \) is the side length.

We know:
\[ 64 = s^3 \]

To find \( s \), we take the cube root of both sides:
\[ s = \sqrt[3]{64} \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each edge of the cubic yew tree, we need to determine the side length of a cube with a volume of 216 cubic meters.

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the length of each edge of the cube.

Given that the volume \( V \) is 216 cubic meters, we can set up the equation:
\[ s^3 = 216 \]

To find \( s \), we take the cube root of both sides:
\[ s = \sqrt[3]{216} \]

Calculating the cube root of 216:
\[ \sqrt[3]{216} = 6 \]

Thus, the length of each edge of the cubic yew tree is 6 meters.

\[ s^3 = 1000 \]

To find \( s \), we take the cube root of both sides:

\[ s = \sqrt[3]{1000} \]

The cube root of 1000 is 10 because:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each edge of a cube when given the volume, we use the formula for the volume of a cube:

\[ V = a^3 \]

where \( V \) is the volume and \( a \) is the length of each edge.

Given that the volume \( V \) is 64 mm\(^3\), we set up the equation:

\[ 64 = a^3 \]

To solve for \( a \), we take the cube root of both sides:

\[ a = \sqrt[3]{64} \]

We know that:

\[ 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64 \]

Thus:

\[ \sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \]

So, the length of each edge of the cube is 4 millimeters.

        The number 27 appears in a dream of a person who loves cryptic letters. He knows this number corresponds to a number obtained by cubing a letter's position in the alphabet. Can you find that letter by its position? (Let's use 'a' as 1, 'b' as 2, and so on.)

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the letter corresponding to the number 27, we need to determine which letter's position in the alphabet, when cubed, equals 27.

Let's denote the position of the letter as \( n \). We need to solve the equation:
\[ n^3 = 27 \]

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ n = \sqrt[3]{27} \]

Since \( 27 = 3^3 \), we have:
\[ n = 3 \]

The letter in the 3rd position of the alphabet is 'c'.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Given that the temperature at the heart of the cubical object is directly proportional to the cube of its length, we can express this relationship as:

\[ T = k \cdot L^3 \]

where \( T \) is the temperature, \( L \) is the length of the object, and \( k \) is the proportionality constant.

We are given:
\[ T = 729 \]

We need to find \( L \). First, we solve for \( k \):

\[ 729 = k \cdot L^3 \]

Since we need to find \( L \), we can assume \( k = 1 \) for simplicity (as the problem does not provide additional information about \( k \)). Thus:

\[ 729 = L^3 \]

To find \( L \), we take the cube root of both sides:

\[ L = \sqrt[3]{729} \]

We know that:

\[ 729 = 9^3 \]

Therefore:

\[ L = 9 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the length of each side of the cubic loaf, we need to find the side length of a cube with a volume of 125 cubic inches.

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cube with side length \( f \) is:
\[ V = f^3 \]

Given that the volume \( V \) is 125 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:
\[ f^3 = 125 \]

To find \( f \), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:
\[ f = \sqrt[3]{125} \]

Since \( 125 = 5^3 \), we have:
\[ f = 5 \]

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the length of the side of the cubic box, we need to find the cube root of the total number of grapes, since the box is cubic and fits 343 grapes perfectly.

The equation to solve is:
\[ \text{side length}^3 = 343 \]

Taking the cube root of both sides:
\[ \text{side length} = \sqrt[3]{343} \]

We know that:
\[ 7 \times 7 \times 7 = 343 \]

Therefore:
\[ \sqrt[3]{343} = 7 \]
