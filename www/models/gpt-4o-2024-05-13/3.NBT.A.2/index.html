        In the morning, Joe used 393 milliliters of toothpaste and later, he decided to use another 397 milliliters of toothpaste. How many milliliters of toothpaste did Joe use in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of toothpaste Joe used, we need to add the amount he used in the morning to the amount he used later.

Joe used 393 milliliters in the morning and 397 milliliters later.

So, we calculate:
\[ 393 + 397 \]

First, add the hundreds:
\[ 300 + 300 = 600 \]

Next, add the tens:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

Then, add the units:
\[ 3 + 7 = 10 \]

Now, sum these partial results:
\[ 600 + 180 + 10 = 790 \]

Therefore, Joe used a total of 790 milliliters of toothpaste.

        Joe noticed that he used too much toothpaste this morning. He decided to save a bit more toothpaste for the next day. By the end of the day, he managed to save 172 milliliters of toothpaste. How many milliliters of toothpaste did Joe end up using for the day?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many milliliters of toothpaste Joe ended up using for the day, we need to subtract the amount he saved from the total amount he initially used.

From the previous problem, we know Joe initially used a total of 790 milliliters of toothpaste.

Joe saved 172 milliliters by the end of the day.

So, we calculate:
\[ 790 - 172 \]

First, subtract the units:
\[ 0 - 2 \] 
Since we can't subtract 2 from 0, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

Next, subtract the tens:
\[ 8 - 7 = 1 \]

Finally, subtract the hundreds:
\[ 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Therefore, the calculation is:
\[ 790 - 172 = 618 \]

Joe ended up using 618 milliliters of toothpaste for the day.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many cookies Baker Bob has left, we need to subtract the number of cookies he sold from the number of cookies he started with.

Starting number of cookies: 747
Cookies sold: 382

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 747 - 382 \]

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Subtract the units place:
   \[ 7 - 2 = 5 \]

2. Subtract the tens place:
   \[ 4 - 8 \]
   Since 4 is less than 8, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place. This makes the 4 become 14, and the 7 in the hundreds place becomes 6.

   \[ 14 - 8 = 6 \]

3. Subtract the hundreds place:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many cookies Baker Bob has left after both the morning and afternoon sales, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Subtract the number of cookies sold in the morning from the starting number of cookies.
2. Subtract the number of cookies sold in the afternoon from the remaining number of cookies after the morning sales.

Starting number of cookies: 747
Cookies sold in the morning: 382
Cookies sold in the afternoon: 33

First, we calculate the remaining cookies after the morning sales:
\[ 747 - 382 \]

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Subtract the units place:
   \[ 7 - 2 = 5 \]

2. Subtract the tens place:
   \[ 4 - 8 \]
   Since 4 is less than 8, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place. This makes the 4 become 14, and the 7 in the hundreds place becomes 6.

   \[ 14 - 8 = 6 \]

3. Subtract the hundreds place:

So, the remaining cookies after the morning sales are:
\[ 747 - 382 = 365 \]

Next, we subtract the cookies sold in the afternoon:
\[ 365 - 33 \]

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Subtract the units place:
   \[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

2. Subtract the tens place:
   \[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

3. Subtract the hundreds place:
   \[ 3 - 0 = 3 \]

So, the remaining cookies after the afternoon sales are:

Bill received a new shipment of 69 sleeping bags.
He already had 167 sleeping bags in stock.

Now, we add these two quantities together:
\[ 167 + 69 \]

First, we add the units place:
\[ 7 + 9 = 16 \]
We write down 6 and carry over 1 to the tens place.

Next, we add the tens place along with the carried over 1:
\[ 6 + 6 + 1 = 13 \]
We write down 3 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.

Finally, we add the hundreds place along with the carried over 1:

If he already had 167 sleeping bags in stock, he would have a certain total of sleeping bags. However, in his yearly inventory check, he expected to have 832 sleeping bags in total. After counting the sleeping bags he got from the new shipment and the existing stock, how many sleeping bags are missing from his expected inventory?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many sleeping bags are missing from Bill's expected inventory, we first need to calculate the total number of sleeping bags he currently has after receiving the new shipment.

Bill received a new shipment of 69 sleeping bags.
He already had 167 sleeping bags in stock.

First, we add these two quantities together:
\[ 167 + 69 \]

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:
1. Add the units place:
\[ 7 + 9 = 16 \]
We write down 6 and carry over 1 to the tens place.

2. Add the tens place along with the carried over 1:
\[ 6 + 6 + 1 = 13 \]
We write down 3 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.

3. Add the hundreds place along with the carried over 1:
\[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]

So, the total number of sleeping bags Bill currently has is:
\[ 236 \]

Next, we need to find out how many sleeping bags are missing from his expected inventory of 832 sleeping bags. We do this by subtracting the number of sleeping bags he currently has from the expected inventory:
\[ 832 - 236 \]

Let's perform the subtraction step-by-step:
1. Subtract the units place:
\[ 2 - 6 \]
Since 2 is less than 6, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place. This makes the units place 12 and the tens place 2 (after borrowing 1 from the hundreds place).

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

2. Subtract the tens place:
\[ 2 - 3 \]
Since 2 is less than 3, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place. This makes the tens place 12 and the hundreds place 7 (after borrowing 1 from the thousands place).

\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]

3. Subtract the hundreds place:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \]

So, the number of sleeping bags missing from his expected inventory is:
\[ 596 \]

1. Add the initial number of strawberries to the additional strawberries that grew.
2. Subtract the number of strawberries that got eaten by birds.

Initial number of strawberries: 419
Additional strawberries that grew: 355
Strawberries eaten by birds: 116

First, we add the initial strawberries and the additional strawberries:

\[ 419 + 355 \]

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:

1. Add the units place: \( 9 + 5 = 14 \) (write down 4 and carry over 1)
2. Add the tens place: \( 1 + 1 + 5 = 7 \)
3. Add the hundreds place: \( 4 + 3 = 7 \)

So, the total number of strawberries before any were eaten is:

\[ 419 + 355 = 774 \]

Next, we subtract the number of strawberries eaten by birds:

\[ 774 - 116 \]

Let's perform the subtraction step-by-step:

1. Subtract the units place: \( 4 - 6 \) (since 4 is less than 6, we borrow 1 from the tens place, making it 14 - 6 = 8)
2. Subtract the tens place: \( 7 - 1 - 1 = 5 \) (since we borrowed 1, it becomes 6 - 1 = 5)
3. Subtract the hundreds place: \( 7 - 1 = 6 \)

        After reviewing the video of her performance, the ballerina realized she had actually performed 443 pirouettes, not 280 as she initially thought. However, she still stumbled and couldn't complete 165 pirouettes. How many pirouettes did the ballerina successfully perform according to the new count?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of pirouettes the ballerina successfully performed according to the new count, we need to subtract the number of pirouettes she could not complete from the new total number of pirouettes she intended to perform.

Given:
- New total pirouettes intended: 443
- Pirouettes not completed: 165

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 443 - 165 = 278 \]

Thus, the ballerina successfully performed 278 pirouettes according to the new count.

        After a thorough check, it was found out that 275 helicopters from Helitech Inc's total count were too old and needed to be decommissioned. How many helicopters does Helitech Inc have now after decommissioning the old ones?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many helicopters Helitech Inc has after decommissioning the old ones, we need to subtract the number of decommissioned helicopters from the total number of helicopters.

From the previous calculation, we know that Helitech Inc had a total of 791 helicopters.

The number of helicopters that need to be decommissioned is 275.

We subtract these two quantities:
\[ 791 - 275 \]

Let's perform the subtraction step-by-step:
\[ 791 - 275 = 516 \]

So, after decommissioning the old helicopters, Helitech Inc has 516 helicopters remaining.

Perform the subtraction step-by-step:
- Units place: \( 8 - 3 = 5 \)
- Tens place: \( 2 - 4 \) (borrow 1 from the hundreds place, making it 12 and reducing the hundreds place by 1)
  \[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]
- Hundreds place: \( 5 - 1 = 4 \)

So, \( 628 - 143 = 485 \).

Next, add the donated bed-sheets to the remaining amount:
\[ 485 + 223 \]

Perform the addition step-by-step:
- Units place: \( 5 + 3 = 8 \)
- Tens place: \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) (write down 0 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place)
- Hundreds place: \( 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \)

So, \( 485 + 223 = 708 \).

        Recall that you were organizing a bedtime event and initially had 628 bed-sheets. Let's change that. Say, you had actually started with 896 bed-sheets instead of 628 and the rest of the scenario remains the same. After accommodating some participants, you used up 143 bed-sheets. How many bed-sheets would you have left then?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many bed-sheets are left, we need to subtract the number of bed-sheets used from the new total number of bed-sheets available at the start.

Starting with 896 bed-sheets and using up 143 bed-sheets, we perform the subtraction:

\[ 896 - 143 \]

First, subtract the units place:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

Next, subtract the tens place:
\[ 9 - 4 = 5 \]

Finally, subtract the hundreds place:
\[ 8 - 1 = 7 \]

Putting it all together, we get:

        In the original scenario, the daring pirate, Captain Scallywag, had a treasure chest filled not with 206 shiny sapphires, but with 426 shiny sapphires as well as his 312 glistening emeralds. Given this, how many precious stones is he starting with in his treasure chest?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of precious stones in Captain Scallywag's treasure chest with the updated number of sapphires, we need to add the number of sapphires and emeralds together.

Number of sapphires: 426
Number of emeralds: 312

Total number of precious stones = Number of sapphires + Number of emeralds
Total number of precious stones = 426 + 312

Let's perform the addition:

426
+312
-----
738

So, the total number of precious stones in the treasure chest is 738.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of jackets in the store after the new shipment, we need to add the initial number of jackets to the number of jackets in the new shipment.

Initial number of jackets: 307
Number of jackets in the new shipment: 262

Total number of jackets = Initial number of jackets + Number of jackets in the new shipment
Total number of jackets = 307 + 262

Let's perform the addition:

307
+ 262
-----
569

So, the total number of jackets in the store now is 569.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many more jackets the store can accommodate, we first need to find the total number of jackets currently in the store after the new shipment. Then, we subtract this total from the store's maximum capacity.

Initial number of jackets: 307
Number of jackets in the new shipment: 262

Total number of jackets after the shipment:
\[ 307 + 262 = 569 \]

The store's maximum capacity is 714 jackets. To find out how many more jackets the store can accommodate, we subtract the current total from the maximum capacity:
\[ 714 - 569 = 145 \]

So, the store can accommodate 145 more jackets.

Initial number of jackets: 432
Number of jackets in the new shipment: 262

Total number of jackets = Initial number of jackets + Number of jackets in the new shipment
Total number of jackets = 432 + 262

Let's perform the addition:

432

694

So, the total number of jackets in the store now is 694.

We perform the subtraction step-by-step:

1. Subtract the units place: \( 4 - 7 \). Since 4 is less than 7, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place.
2. The tens place now has 9 (since we borrowed 1 from the hundreds place, making it 10, and then subtracting 1 for the units place).

- The store originally had 126 pairs.
- 110 pairs were sold, leaving 16 pairs remaining.

After the new shipment, the total number of pairs is 216.

We subtract the remaining pairs from the original stock from the new total to find the number of pairs in the new shipment:
\[ 216 - 16 = 200 \]

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pairs of ice skates the store has left, we need to subtract the number of pairs sold from the new initial number of pairs.

New initial number of pairs of ice skates: 968
Number of pairs sold: 110

Now, we perform the subtraction:
\[ 968 - 110 = 858 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many building blocks Jack has left, we need to subtract the number of blocks he used to build the castle from the total number of blocks he initially had.

Jack initially has 391 building blocks.
He uses 368 blocks to build a castle.

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 391 - 368 = 23 \]

So, Jack has 23 building blocks left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many total building blocks Jack has now, we need to add the number of blocks he found in the old box to the number of blocks he had left after building the castle.

Jack had 23 building blocks left after building the castle.
He found an additional 715 building blocks in the old box.

We perform the addition:
\[ 23 + 715 = 738 \]

So, Jack now has a total of 738 building blocks.
