2. The cloudiness index of city A is 1 point more than that of city B.

Let \( x \) be the cloudiness index of city B. According to the problem, the cloudiness index of city A is \( x + 1 \).

Given that the cloudiness index of city A is 157, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 1 = 157 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 157 - 1 \]

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many seashells the mermaid finds each day, we need to divide the total number of seashells by the number of days in her vacation.

Given:
- Total seashells = 9282
- Number of days = 91

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{9282}{91} \]

First, let's set up the division:

\[ 9282 \div 91 \]

We can use long division to solve this:

1. 91 goes into 928 (the first three digits of 9282) 10 times because \( 91 \times 10 = 910 \).
2. Subtract 910 from 928 to get 18.
3. Bring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 182.
4. 91 goes into 182 exactly 2 times because \( 91 \times 2 = 182 \).

So, the division is exact, and the quotient is:

\[ 9282 \div 91 = 102 \]

Thus, the mermaid finds 102 seashells each day.

We can set up the equation:
Initial apples + 219 = 348

To find the initial number of apples, we subtract 219 from 348:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many minutes ahead Angela's watch was initially set, we need to consider the information given:

1. Angela's watch is fast by 262 minutes.
2. The watch is showing a time that is 399 minutes later than the actual time.

The difference between the time shown by the watch and the actual time is 399 minutes. This difference includes the 262 minutes by which the watch is fast. Therefore, the remaining difference must be the initial setting ahead of the actual time.

Let's denote the initial setting ahead by \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the total difference of 399 minutes is the sum of the watch being fast by 262 minutes and the initial setting ahead \( x \):

\[ 262 + x = 399 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 399 - 262 \]
\[ x = 137 \]

Thus, the watch was initially set 137 minutes ahead.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of tomato plants the farmer has, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes by the number of tomatoes produced by each plant.

Given:
- Total number of tomatoes = 1190
- Number of tomatoes per plant = 35

We perform the division:
\[ \text{Number of plants} = \frac{1190}{35} \]

First, let's simplify the division:
\[ 1190 \div 35 = 34 \]

So, the farmer has 34 tomato plants.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many days it took the cat to catch a total of 1504 mice, we need to divide the total number of mice by the number of mice caught per day.

Given:
- The cat catches 32 mice every day.
- The total number of mice caught is 1504.

We use the formula:
\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total number of mice}}{\text{Number of mice caught per day}}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{1504}{32}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
1504 \div 32 = 47
\]

So, it took the cat 47 days to catch all the mice.

        On a farm, there are a total of 727 animals. If 342 of those animals are chickens, how many animals are not chickens?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of animals that are not chickens, we need to subtract the number of chickens from the total number of animals on the farm.

Given:
- Total number of animals = 727
- Number of chickens = 342

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 727 - 342 = 385 \]

So, the number of animals that are not chickens is 385.

        A chocolate factory has a daily production of 385 chocolate bars. If 230 bars are dark chocolate, how many bars are milk chocolate?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of milk chocolate bars produced daily, we need to subtract the number of dark chocolate bars from the total daily production.

Given:
- Total daily production of chocolate bars = 385
- Number of dark chocolate bars = 230

We can find the number of milk chocolate bars by performing the following subtraction:

\[ \text{Number of milk chocolate bars} = \text{Total daily production} - \text{Number of dark chocolate bars} \]

\[ \text{Number of milk chocolate bars} = 385 - 230 \]

\[ \text{Number of milk chocolate bars} = 155 \]

        The initial altitude of a mountain is 289 meters above sea level but after some tectonic activity, it is now 357 meters above sea level. By how many meters did the altitude increase after the tectonic activity?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the increase in altitude, we need to subtract the initial altitude from the new altitude.

Initial altitude: 289 meters
New altitude: 357 meters

Increase in altitude = New altitude - Initial altitude
Increase in altitude = 357 meters - 289 meters

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

357 - 289 = 68

### Answer: 68 meters</pre>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of monkeys in the zoo, we need to divide the total amount of food required by the amount of food each monkey eats in a month.

Given:
- Total food required: 4572 pounds
- Food consumed by each monkey in a month: 36 pounds

We can find the number of monkeys by performing the division:
\[ \text{Number of monkeys} = \frac{\text{Total food required}}{\text{Food consumed by each monkey}} \]
\[ \text{Number of monkeys} = \frac{4572}{36} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ 4572 \div 36 = 127 \]

So, there are 127 monkeys in the zoo.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of rooms in the doll house, we need to divide the total number of dolls by the number of dolls each room can hold.

Given:
- Total number of dolls = 832
- Number of dolls each room can hold = 16

We perform the division:
\[ \text{Number of rooms} = \frac{832}{16} \]

Now, let's calculate:
\[ \frac{832}{16} = 52 \]

So, the doll house has 52 rooms.
