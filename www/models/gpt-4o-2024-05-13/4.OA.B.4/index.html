    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find all factor pairs of 64, we need to identify all pairs of integers that multiply together to give 64.

1. Start with 1:
   \[
   1 \times 64 = 64
   \]
   So, (1, 64) is a factor pair.

2. Next, try 2:
   \[
   2 \times 32 = 64
   \]
   So, (2, 32) is a factor pair.

3. Next, try 4:
   \[
   4 \times 16 = 64
   \]
   So, (4, 16) is a factor pair.

4. Next, try 8:
   \[
   8 \times 8 = 64
   \]
   So, (8, 8) is a factor pair.

Since 8 is the square root of 64, we have found all unique factor pairs. Listing them, we have:
- (1, 64)
- (2, 32)
- (4, 16)
- (8, 8)

   - Factor pair: (2, 9)

3. Next, try 3:
   - \(3 \times 6 = 18\)
   - Factor pair: (3, 6)

4. Next, try 4:
   - \(4 \times 4.5 = 18\) (4.5 is not an integer, so this is not a valid factor pair)

5. Next, try 5:
   - \(5 \times 3.6 = 18\) (3.6 is not an integer, so this is not a valid factor pair)

6. Finally, try 6:
   - \(6 \times 3 = 18\) (This is the same as the pair (3, 6), which we already have)

Since we have checked all integers up to the square root of 18, we have found all the factor pairs.

1. Start with 1:

   So, (1, 28) is a factor pair.

2. Next, try 2:

   So, (2, 14) is a factor pair.

3. Next, try 3:

   Since 28 is not divisible by 3, there is no factor pair involving 3.

4. Next, try 4:

   So, (4, 7) is a factor pair.

5. Next, try 5:

   Since 28 is not divisible by 6, there is no factor pair involving 6.

Since we have checked all integers up to the square root of 28 (approximately 5.29), we have found all factor pairs.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the factor pairs of 59, we need to determine which pairs of integers multiply together to give 59.

First, we check if 59 is a prime number. A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We test divisibility by all prime numbers less than the square root of 59 (approximately 7.68).

- 59 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
- 59 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits, 5 + 9 = 14, is not divisible by 3).
- 59 is not divisible by 5 (it does not end in 0 or 5).
- 59 is not divisible by 7 (59 ÷ 7 ≈ 8.4286, not an integer).

Since 59 is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number. Therefore, the only factor pairs of 59 are (1, 59).

2. Next, try 2:

3. Try 3:

4. Try 4:

5. Try 5:

7. Try 7:

1. Start with 1:

   So, (1, 95) is a factor pair.

2. Check the next integer, 2:

   Since 47.5 is not an integer, 2 is not a factor.

3. Check the next integer, 3:

   Since 31.67 is not an integer, 3 is not a factor.

4. Check the next integer, 4:
   \[
   95 \div 4 = 23.75

   Since 23.75 is not an integer, 4 is not a factor.

5. Check the next integer, 5:

   Since 19 is an integer, (5, 19) is a factor pair.

6. Check the next integer, 6:

   Since 15.83 is not an integer, 6 is not a factor.

7. Continue this process up to the square root of 95 (approximately 9.75). Since we have already checked all integers up to 9, we can stop here.

The factor pairs of 95 are:

First, we check if 59 is a prime number. A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We test divisibility by all prime numbers less than the square root of 59 (approximately 7.68).

- 59 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
- 59 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits, 5 + 9 = 14, is not divisible by 3).
- 59 is not divisible by 5 (it does not end in 0 or 5).
- 59 is not divisible by 7 (59 ÷ 7 ≈ 8.4286, not an integer).

   - \(1 \times 51 = 51\)
   - Factor pair: (1, 51)

2. Check the next integer, 2:
   - 51 is not divisible by 2 (since 51 is odd).

3. Check the next integer, 3:
   - \(51 \div 3 = 17\)
   - \(3 \times 17 = 51\)
   - Factor pair: (3, 17)

4. Check the next integer, 4:
   - 51 is not divisible by 4.

5. Check the next integer, 5:
   - 51 is not divisible by 5.

6. Check the next integer, 6:
   - 51 is not divisible by 6.

7. Continue this process until the square root of 51 (approximately 7.14):
   - 51 is not divisible by 7.

Since we have checked all integers up to the square root of 51, we have found all factor pairs.

2. Check if there are any other pairs:
   - 2 is not a factor of 17 because 17 is not divisible by 2.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To identify all factor pairs of the number 91, we need to find pairs of integers that multiply together to give 91.

1. Start with 1:
   \[
   1 \times 91 = 91

   So, (1, 91) is a factor pair.

2. Check the next integer, 2:
   \[
   91 \div 2 = 45.5
   \]
   Since 45.5 is not an integer, 2 is not a factor.

3. Check the next integer, 3:
   \[
   91 \div 3 \approx 30.33
   \]
   Since 30.33 is not an integer, 3 is not a factor.

4. Check the next integer, 4:
   \[
   91 \div 4 = 22.75
   \]
   Since 22.75 is not an integer, 4 is not a factor.

5. Check the next integer, 5:
   \[

   Since 18.2 is not an integer, 5 is not a factor.

6. Check the next integer, 6:
   \[
   91 \div 6 \approx 15.17

   Since 15.17 is not an integer, 6 is not a factor.

7. Check the next integer, 7:
   \[
   91 \div 7 = 13
   \]
   Since 13 is an integer, (7, 13) is a factor pair.

8. Check the next integer, 8:
   \[
   91 \div 8 \approx 11.375
   \]
   Since 11.375 is not an integer, 8 is not a factor.

9. Check the next integer, 9:
   \[
   91 \div 9 \approx 10.11

   Since 10.11 is not an integer, 9 is not a factor.

Since we have checked all integers up to the square root of 91 (approximately 9.5), we have found all factor pairs.

First, we check if 97 is a prime number. A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We test divisibility by all prime numbers less than the square root of 97 (approximately 9.8).

- 97 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
- 97 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits, 9 + 7 = 16, which is not divisible by 3).
- 97 is not divisible by 5 (it does not end in 0 or 5).
- 97 is not divisible by 7 (97 ÷ 7 ≈ 13.857, not an integer).

Since 97 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, it is a prime number. Therefore, the only factor pairs of 97 are (1, 97).

   38 \div 9 \approx 4.22 \quad \text{(not an integer, so 9 is not a factor)}
   \]

10. Check 10:
    \[
    38 \div 10 = 3.8 \quad \text{(not an integer, so 10 is not a factor)}

   So, (2, 47) is a factor pair.

3. Check 3:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To identify all factor pairs of the number 33, we need to find pairs of integers that multiply together to give 33.

1. Start with 1:

   - So, (1, 33) is a factor pair.

2. Next, check 2:
   - \(2 \times 16.5 = 33\)
   - Since 16.5 is not an integer, (2, 16.5) is not a factor pair.

3. Check 3:

   - So, (3, 11) is a factor pair.

4. Check 4:

   - Since 6.6 is not an integer, (5, 6.6) is not a factor pair.

6. Check 6:

   - Since 5.5 is not an integer, (6, 5.5) is not a factor pair.

7. Check 7:
   - \(7 \times 4.714 = 33\)
   - Since 4.714 is not an integer, (7, 4.714) is not a factor pair.

8. Check 8 and higher:
   - Any higher number will result in a product that is less than 33 when multiplied by another integer greater than 1.

Thus, the factor pairs of 33 are:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the factor pairs of 59, we need to identify all pairs of integers that multiply together to give 59.

First, we check if 59 is a prime number. A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We test divisibility by all prime numbers less than the square root of 59 (approximately 7.68).

- 59 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
- 59 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits, 5 + 9 = 14, is not divisible by 3).
- 59 is not divisible by 5 (it does not end in 0 or 5).
- 59 is not divisible by 7 (59 ÷ 7 ≈ 8.4286, not an integer).

Since 59 is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number. Therefore, the only factor pairs of 59 are (1, 59) and (59, 1).

   So, (2, 27) is a factor pair.

3. Next, try 3:

   So, (3, 18) is a factor pair.

4. Next, try 4:

   Since 13.5 is not an integer, (4, 13.5) is not a factor pair.

5. Next, try 5:
   \( 5 \times 10.8 = 54 \)
   Since 10.8 is not an integer, (5, 10.8) is not a factor pair.

6. Next, try 6:

   So, (6, 9) is a factor pair.

7. Next, try 7:
   \( 7 \times 7.714 \approx 54 \)
   Since 7.714 is not an integer, (7, 7.714) is not a factor pair.

Since we have tried all integers up to the square root of 54 (approximately 7.35), we have found all the factor pairs.

6. Check the number 6:

7. Continue checking numbers up to the square root of 85 (approximately 9.22):

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To identify all factor pairs of the number 34, we need to find pairs of integers that multiply together to give 34.

1. Start with the number 1:
   - \(1 \times 34 = 34\)
   - So, (1, 34) is a factor pair.

2. Next, check the number 2:
   - \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
   - So, (2, 17) is a factor pair.

3. Check the number 3:
   - \(3 \times \text{(no integer)} = 34\)
   - 3 is not a factor of 34.

4. Check the number 4:
   - \(4 \times \text{(no integer)} = 34\)
   - 4 is not a factor of 34.

5. Continue this process up to the square root of 34 (approximately 5.83):
   - Since 5 is not a factor of 34, we stop here.

Thus, the factor pairs of 34 are:
- (1, 34)
- (2, 17)

1. Start with 1:

   So, (1, 88) is a factor pair.

2. Next, try 2:

8. Next, try 8:

Since we have tried all integers up to the square root of 88 (approximately 9.38), we have found all factor pairs.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the factor pairs of 83, we need to determine which pairs of integers multiply together to give 83.

First, we check if 83 is a prime number. A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We test divisibility by all prime numbers less than the square root of 83 (approximately 9.1).

- 83 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
- 83 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits 8 + 3 = 11, which is not divisible by 3).
- 83 is not divisible by 5 (it does not end in 0 or 5).
- 83 is not divisible by 7 (83 ÷ 7 ≈ 11.857, not an integer).

Since 83 is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number. Therefore, the only factor pairs are (1, 83) and (83, 1).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find all the factor pairs of 60, we need to identify all pairs of integers that multiply together to give 60.

1. Start with 1:
   - \(1 \times 60 = 60\)
   - Factor pair: (1, 60)

2. Next, try 2:
   - \(2 \times 30 = 60\)
   - Factor pair: (2, 30)

3. Next, try 3:
   - \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

   - Factor pair: (5, 12)

6. Next, try 6:
   - \(6 \times 10 = 60\)
   - Factor pair: (6, 10)

7. Next, try 7:

8. Next, try 8:
   - \(8 \times \text{(not an integer)}\)
   - No factor pair

9. Next, try 9:
   - \(9 \times \text{(not an integer)}\)
   - No factor pair

10. Finally, try 10:
    - \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
    - Factor pair: (10, 6) (already listed as (6, 10))

Thus, the factor pairs of 60 are:

   So, (2, 29) is a factor pair.

3. Check the next integer, 3:
   \( 3 \times \text{(not an integer)} \neq 58 \)
   So, 3 is not a factor.

4. Continue checking integers up to the square root of 58 (approximately 7.6):

   - Factor pair: (4, 20)

4. Next, try 5:
   - \(5 \times 16 = 80\)
   - Factor pair: (5, 16)

5. Next, try 8:
   - \(8 \times 10 = 80\)

6. Check for any other factors:
   - 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 do not divide 80 evenly.

Thus, the factor pairs of 80 are:
(1, 80), (2, 40), (4, 20), (5, 16), and (8, 10).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find all factor pairs of 45, we need to identify all pairs of integers that multiply together to give 45.

1. Start with 1:
   \( 1 \times 45 = 45 \)
   So, (1, 45) is a factor pair.

2. Next, try 2:
   \( 2 \times \text{(no integer)} = 45 \)
   2 is not a factor of 45.

3. Try 3:
   \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \)
   So, (3, 15) is a factor pair.

4. Try 4:
   \( 4 \times \text{(no integer)} = 45 \)
   4 is not a factor of 45.

5. Try 5:

   6 is not a factor of 45.

7. Try 7:

   7 is not a factor of 45.

8. Try 8:
   \( 8 \times \text{(no integer)} = 45 \)
   8 is not a factor of 45.

9. Try 9:
   \( 9 \times 5 = 45 \)
   We already have this pair as (5, 9).

10. Continue until the square root of 45 (approximately 6.7):
    We have already covered all possible pairs.

Thus, the factor pairs of 45 are:
(1, 45), (3, 15), and (5, 9).

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the factor pairs of 89, we first need to identify its factors. A factor pair consists of two numbers that, when multiplied together, equal 89.

1. Start by checking if 89 is a prime number. A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. Check divisibility by smaller prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7):
   - 89 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - The sum of the digits of 89 is 8 + 9 = 17, which is not divisible by 3.
   - 89 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
   - For 7, we perform the division: 89 ÷ 7 ≈ 12.71, which is not an integer.

Since 89 is not divisible by any of these smaller prime numbers, it is a prime number. Therefore, the only factor pairs of 89 are (1, 89).

4. Next, try 4:
   - \(4 \times 4.5 = 18\)
   - Since 4.5 is not an integer, (4, 4.5) is not a valid factor pair.

5. Next, try 5:
   - \(5 \times 3.6 = 18\)
   - Since 3.6 is not an integer, (5, 3.6) is not a valid factor pair.

6. Finally, try 6:
   - \(6 \times 3 = 18\)
   - This is the same as the pair (3, 6), which we already have.

Thus, the factor pairs of 18 are:
- (1, 18)
- (2, 9)
- (3, 6)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the factor pairs of 61, we need to determine which pairs of integers multiply together to give 61.

First, we check if 61 is a prime number. A prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We test divisibility by all prime numbers less than the square root of 61 (approximately 7.81).

- 61 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
- 61 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits, 6 + 1 = 7, is not divisible by 3).
- 61 is not divisible by 5 (it does not end in 0 or 5).
- 61 is not divisible by 7 (61 ÷ 7 ≈ 8.71, not an integer).

Since 61 is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number. Therefore, the only factor pairs of 61 are (1, 61) and (61, 1).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find all the factor pairs of 86, we need to determine which pairs of integers multiply together to give 86.

1. Start with 1:
   - \(1 \times 86 = 86\)
   - So, (1, 86) is a factor pair.

2. Check 2:
   - \(2 \times 43 = 86\)
   - So, (2, 43) is a factor pair.

3. Check 3:
   - \(86 \div 3 \approx 28.67\) (not an integer, so 3 is not a factor)

4. Check 4:
   - \(86 \div 4 = 21.5\) (not an integer, so 4 is not a factor)

5. Check 5:
   - \(86 \div 5 = 17.2\) (not an integer, so 5 is not a factor)

6. Check 6:
   - \(86 \div 6 \approx 14.33\) (not an integer, so 6 is not a factor)

7. Check 7:
   - \(86 \div 7 \approx 12.29\) (not an integer, so 7 is not a factor)

8. Continue this process up to the square root of 86 (approximately 9.3):
   - 8 and 9 are not factors since \(86 \div 8 \approx 10.75\) and \(86 \div 9 \approx 9.56\) are not integers.

Since we have checked all possible factors up to the square root of 86, we have found all the factor pairs.

1. Start with 1:
   - \(1 \times 57 = 57\)
   - So, (1, 57) is a factor pair.

2. Check the next integer, 2:
   - \(2 \times \text{(no integer)} = 57\)
   - 57 is not divisible by 2, so 2 is not a factor.

3. Check the next integer, 3:

4. Check the next integer, 4:

   - 57 is not divisible by 4, so 4 is not a factor.

5. Check the next integer, 5:
   - \(5 \times \text{(no integer)} = 57\)
   - 57 is not divisible by 5, so 5 is not a factor.

6. Check the next integer, 6:
   - \(6 \times \text{(no integer)} = 57\)
   - 57 is not divisible by 6, so 6 is not a factor.

7. Check the next integer, 7:
   - \(7 \times \text{(no integer)} = 57\)
   - 57 is not divisible by 7, so 7 is not a factor.

8. Continue this process until the square root of 57 (approximately 7.55). Since we have already checked up to 7, we have found all factor pairs.

The factor pairs of 57 are:

1. Start with 1:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To identify all the distinct pairs of factors that multiply to give the number 93, we need to find pairs of integers \((a, b)\) such that \(a \times b = 93\).

First, we perform the prime factorization of 93:
- 93 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 93 is \(9 + 3 = 12\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 93 is divisible by 3.
- Dividing 93 by 3, we get \(93 \div 3 = 31\).

Thus, the prime factorization of 93 is \(3 \times 31\).

Now, we list the pairs of factors:
1. \(1 \times 93 = 93\)
