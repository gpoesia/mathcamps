        A dolphin can travel 1687.56 miles within a certain period. If it travels the same distance in 29.4 days, how many miles does the dolphin travel each day?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of miles the dolphin travels each day, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the number of days: 1687.56 miles / 29.4 days = &lt;&lt;1687.56/29.4=57.4&gt;&gt;57.4 miles per day.

        In a different scenario, suppose the cheese factory still produced 8578.02 kilograms of cheese, but this time, it was distributed equally among 19 supermarkets instead of 90.2. How many kilograms of cheese would each supermarket receive now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To determine the cheese each supermarket gets, we divide the total cheese produced (8578.02 kg) by the number of supermarkets (19). 
Therefore, each supermarket would receive 8578.02 kg / 19 = 451.47 kg of cheese.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: In order to find the total number of chickens, we must multiply the number of chickens per coop by the number of coops: 47.33 x 73.34 = &lt;&lt;47.33*73.34=3472.1022&gt;&gt;3472.1022.
Since we can't have fractions of chickens, we round to the nearest whole number: 3472.

        A dragon was on a treasure collecting spree. In one castle, it found a huge pile of gold weighing 51.76 kg. In the next castle, it found an even bigger pile of gold weighing 65.26 kg. How much gold in kilograms did the dragon collect in total from the two castles?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total weight of gold the dragon collected, we need to add the weight of gold from the first castle to the weight of gold from the second castle.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The dragon started with 117.02 kg of gold and gave away 98.5 kg.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total weight of tomatoes harvested, we need to add the weight from the greenhouse to the weight from the outdoor garden. 
This means we need to calculate 28.9 + 57.0 = &lt;&lt;28.9+57=85.9&gt;&gt;85.9 pounds

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The farmer harvested a total of 85.9 pounds of tomatoes today.  Adding this to the 84.31 pounds he already had, we get 85.9 + 84.31 = &lt;&lt;85.9+84.31=170.21&gt;&gt;170.21 pounds

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

        The store is offering a $6.4 discount on the total skating pack (roller skates and protective gear combined). What is the new price of the total skating pack after applying the discount?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to subtract the discount from the original total price, which was $66.5 (calculated previously). 
The new price will be $66.5 - $6.4 = $&lt;&lt;66.5-6.4=60.1&gt;&gt;60.1

        Suppose the actual price of the roller skates was $52 instead of $42.9. What would be the total cost for the roller skates and the protective gear?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We need to add the new price of the roller skates ($52) to the price of the protective gear ($23.6).
This means we need to calculate $52 + $23.6 = $&lt;&lt;52+23.6=75.6&gt;&gt;75.6

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total weight, we add the weight of the first type of bead to the weight of the second type of bead.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find the difference between the new total distance and the distance to the tree: 78 meters - 24.6 meters = 53.4 meters.

        Following from the previous scenario, after travelling 2.46 light years every month for 3.5 months, the UFO then continued travelling for an additional 33.17 light years. How far did the UFO travel in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The UFO had already travelled 8.61 light years, and then travelled a further 33.17 light years, making a total of 8.61+33.17 = &lt;&lt;8.61+33.17=41.78&gt;&gt;41.78 light years.

        In the previous situation, the UFO was assumed to travel 2.46 light years every month for 3.5 months. Now assume that the UFO has instead been traveling at that speed for 68 months. How far in light years would the UFO have traveled this time?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: If the UFO travels 2.46 light years every month, then in 68 months it would travel 2.46*68 = &lt;&lt;2.46*68=167.28&gt;&gt;167.28 light years.

        In a park, there is a rectangular field with an area of 36.82 square meters. If there are 57.5 such fields in the park, what is the total area, in square meters, of all these fields?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We multiply the area of one field by the total number of fields to find the total area: 36.82 * 57.5 = 2116.15

        A herd of giraffes collectively eats 2571.29 kilograms of leaves each day. If there are 38.9 giraffes in the herd, how many kilograms of leaves does each giraffe eat daily?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to divide the total weight of leaves (2571.29 kilograms) by the number of giraffes (38.9) to find out how much each giraffe eats.
This translates to the calculation: 2571.29 / 38.9 = &lt;&lt;2571.29/38.9=66.1&gt;&gt;66.1 kilograms per giraffe.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Following on from the previous problem, suppose the number of giraffes in the herd were halved to 19 instead of 38.9. Assuming the same total amount of leaf consumption as before (2571.29 kilograms), how many kilograms of leaves would each giraffe in this smaller herd consume daily?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: With half the number of giraffes, and the same total food consumption, each giraffe would need to eat twice as much.  
Therefore, each giraffe would consume 2571.29 / 19 = &lt;&lt;2571.29/19=135.33105263157895&gt;&gt;135.33 kilograms of leaves daily.

        A unicorn needs 217.35 units of magic energy to teleport to another location. If one rainbow provides 20.7 units of magic energy, how many rainbows will it consume for the unicorn to teleport once?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find how many times 20.7 fits into 217.35, so we will divide the total energy needed by the energy provided by each rainbow:  217.35 / 20.7 = 10.5.

        In the previous problem, a unicorn needed 217.35 units of magic energy to teleport to another location and then recover. But what if a smaller, younger unicorn only needs 83 units of magic energy to teleport? How many rainbows would this younger unicorn consume for just the teleportation part?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know one rainbow provides 20.7 units of magic energy, and the younger unicorn needs 83 units just for teleportation. To find out how many rainbows this unicorn needs, we'll divide the total energy needed for teleportation by the energy provided by a single rainbow: 83 / 20.7 ≈ 4.01. 

Since the unicorn can't consume parts of rainbows, we round up to the nearest whole number.
