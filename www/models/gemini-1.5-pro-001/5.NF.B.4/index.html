        Here's a math problem about multiplying fractions and whole numbers: 

Johnny has 8 friends. He promised to give each of his friends 13/8 pounds of candy. How many pounds of candy will Johnny need in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total pounds of candy, we need to multiply the number of friends (8) by the amount each friend receives (13/8 pounds).

This translates to the multiplication problem: 8 * (13/8)

Since 8 can be represented as 8/1, the problem becomes: (8/1) * (13/8)

Multiplying the numerators and denominators gives us: (8 * 13) / (1 * 8) = 104/8

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Mathew was cutting up some square blocks for a craft project. Each block was 16/18th of a foot long. Mathew needed 16/7th of a foot long blocks for his project. If he uses all the blocks, how long in feet would the blocks be in total? Solve this by using multiplication of fractions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total length of the blocks, we need to multiply the length of each block by the number of blocks: (16/18) * (16/7). 
When we multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators: (16 * 16) / (18 * 7).
This gives us: 256/126.
This fraction can be simplified to 128/63.
The final step is to convert our improper fraction into a mixed number. 63 goes into 128 twice with a remainder of 2.

        In light of the previous scenario, suppose Mathew decides to modify the length of the blocks he is using. Instead of each block being 16/18th of a foot long, he thinks having each block as 18/18th (a full foot) long would make his craft project more appealing. If he still needs 16/7th of a foot long blocks for his project, how long in feet would the blocks be in total this time?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can simplify 18/18 to 1. So now we need to figure out what 16/7 * 1 equals. Any number multiplied by 1 is itself. 
Therefore, the total length of the blocks is 16/7 feet.
We can express this improper fraction as a mixed number. 7 goes into 16 twice with a remainder of 2.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Any number multiplied by 1 will result in that same number.  8/8 is equivalent to 1. Therefore, multiplying 15 by 8/8 is the same as multiplying 15 by 1.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know from the previous problem that 8/8 multiplied by 15 equals 15.  So, this problem simplifies to 15 multiplied by 19/18.  This can be solved by multiplying 15/1 by 19/18, which equals 285/18.  This can be simplified to 95/6.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The problem asks how many apples you have if you have two-thirds of the amount needed for the recipe. Multiplying the number of apples needed for the recipe (10) by 4/6 will not give you the correct answer. Instead, you should multiply 10 apples by 2/3.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the mushroom pizzas sell out in 60*(9/20) = &lt;&lt;60*(9/20)=27&gt;&gt;27 minutes.
That means the chef has 60/27 = &lt;&lt;60/27=2.22&gt;&gt;2.22 minutes per pizza.
So in 60 minutes, the chef can make 60/2.22 = &lt;&lt;60/2.22=27.03&gt;&gt;27.03 mushroom pizzas.
Since we only care about whole pizzas, the chef can make 27 mushroom pizzas before they sell out.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We previously found that (18/11) * (17/8) = 153/44. Now we need to multiply that result by 12/19:

(153/44) * (12/19) 

Again, we multiply numerators and denominators: (153 * 12) / (44 * 19)

We can simplify by canceling common factors: (153 * 3) / (11 * 19) = 459/209

    <pre class="model-raw-response">The previous result was 16 4/11. Now we need to multiply this by 4/5.

First, convert the mixed number to a fraction: 16 4/11 = (16*11 + 4)/11 = 180/11

Now multiply: (180/11) * (4/5) = (180 * 4) / (11 * 5) = 720 / 55

Simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 5: 720/55 = 144/11

Now we simplify this improper fraction by finding the largest multiple of 11 that is less than 63, which is 55 (5*11=55). Therefore, 63/11 can be expressed as 5 with a remainder of 8, or the mixed number 5 8/11.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 2 divided by 3 is 2 / 3 = &lt;&lt;2/3=0.6666666666666666&gt;&gt;0.6666666666666666
Then, multiplying 0.6666666666666666 by 3 gives us 0.6666666666666666 * 3 = &lt;&lt;0.6666666666666666*3=2&gt;&gt; 2.

        If each box of chocolates contains 12 pieces and each piece is split into 8 equal parts for tasting, how many whole pieces of chocolate are there if there are 6 boxes? Use the equation t = (6 * (12 / 8)) to calculate your answer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The equation t = (6 * (12 / 8)) represents the total number of pieces (t) calculated by multiplying the number of boxes (6) by the number of pieces per box (12) and then dividing by the number of parts each piece is split into (8).
Following the order of operations, we first calculate 12/8 = &lt;&lt;12/8=1.5&gt;&gt;1.5
We then multiply 6 * 1.5 = &lt;&lt;6*1.5=9&gt;&gt;9
This result represents the total number of pieces after they have been split into smaller parts for tasting. However, the question asks for the number of *whole* pieces. 
Since there were initially 12 pieces in each box and there are 6 boxes, there are a total of 6 * 12 = &lt;&lt;6*12=72&gt;&gt;72 whole pieces of chocolate.

Decreasing her spending by 4 times less than (20/19) means she wants to spend (20/19)/4 on the upcoming Tuesday.
This calculation becomes (20/19)*(1/4) = 5/19.

        The previous problem was about Bear bringing back the ball twice every minute while playing for 6 minutes. 

Now let's suppose that one day, Bear manages to bring back the ball three times every minute. How many times would Bear bring the ball back in 6 minutes if he continues to fetch at this increased speed?

This can be represented by 3 * 6. Calculate the product.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  If Bear brings the ball back 3 times each minute, over 6 minutes he would bring it back a total of 3 * 6 = 18 times.

        Calculate the answer to the following problem: (2 / 20) * 14. Write your answer as a decimal or a simplified fraction, whichever you prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, simplify the fraction 2/20 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 2: (2/2) / (20/2) = 1/10.
Now, multiply the simplified fraction by 14: (1/10) * 14 = 14/10.
Finally, simplify the resulting fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2: (14/2) / (10/2) = 7/5. Alternatively, you can express 7/5 as a decimal: 1.4.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We previously found that (2/20) * 14 is equal to 7/5. Now we multiply that result by (7/2): (7/5) * (7/2) = (7*7)/(5*2) = 49/10.  Let's call this result 'a', so a = 49/10.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, simplify the fraction 2/12 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 2: (2/2) / (12/2) = 1/6. 
Now, multiply the simplified fraction by 14: (1/6) * 14 = 14/6.
Finally, simplify the resulting fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2: (14/2) / (6/2) = 7/3.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Multiplying by 18 is the same as multiplying by (18/1).  Therefore we obtain (5/14)*(18/1) = (5*18)/(14*1).  This simplifies to 90/14.  This fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2, yielding 45/7.
