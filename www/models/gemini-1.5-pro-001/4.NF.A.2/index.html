(3 / 7) _ (9 / 10)

Is the comparison the same or different than the comparison between 3 / 2 and 9 / 10? Think about the impact of decreasing the numerator of our first fraction on the comparison.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's compare the fractions 3/7 and 9/10.

* **Benchmark Fractions:**  We can use benchmark fractions (like 1/2) to help us.
    * 3/7 is a bit less than half (since half of 7 is 3.5).
    * 9/10 is much closer to 1 (only 1/10 away).

* **Conclusion:**  Since 3/7 is less than half and 9/10 is almost a whole, we know that 3/7 is less than 9/10.

**Impact of the Change:** Yes, the comparison is different than before. When we decreased the numerator of the first fraction from 3/2 to 3/7, we made the fraction smaller. This made it smaller than 9/10, even though 3/2 was larger than 9/10.

        Let's revisit the previous comparison of fractions, but this time consider the change:
(10 / 3) _ (10 / 10)

Complete the comparison by filling in the blank with the appropriate symbol (&lt;, &gt;, or =). What happens to the comparison when the denominator of the second fraction is increased to 10?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Both fractions still have the same numerator (10).  However, now the second fraction, 10/10, represents one whole.  Since 10/3 is larger than one whole, it is the greater fraction.

### Answer: &lt; 

In the previous question, we compared 3/9 to 8/8, which simplifies to 1. We found that 3/9 is less than 1. By increasing the denominator of the second fraction to 8/3, we are making the fraction larger than 1. This is because we are dividing by a smaller number, leading to a larger result. Therefore, 3/9 is less than 8/3.

Yes, the change in the denominator affects the outcome. Even though we're still comparing fractions with 6 in the numerator, the smaller the denominator, the larger the value of the fraction. This is because a smaller denominator means we're dividing the same numerator (6 in this case) into fewer parts, resulting in larger slices of our metaphorical pie.

Since 27/36 is greater than 24/36:
**(3/4) &gt; (6/9)**

**Explanation of the change:** When 6 was divided by 5, the resulting fraction (6/5) was greater than (3/4). However, when 6 is divided by 9, the resulting fraction (6/9) becomes smaller than (3/4). This happens because dividing by a larger number (9 vs. 5) results in a smaller overall value.

Compare the following fractions by filling in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =:

Since 50 is greater than 36, then (5/9) is greater than (4/10). 

### Answer: &gt;

**What happened?**

When we changed the denominator of the second fraction from 7 to 10, we made the fraction smaller. This is because we are dividing the same numerator (4) into more parts (10 instead of 7), resulting in smaller pieces. Consequently, (5/9) became the larger fraction.

Use &lt;, &gt; or = to complete the comparison. This question asks you to think about what happens when we change the number of parts the whole is divided into.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Let's cross-multiply to compare (10/7) and (9/3):

* 10 * 3 = 30

Since 30 &lt; 63, then (10/7) &lt; (9/3). 

This new ratio (9/3) is greater than the first one (9/6). This is because the numerator stayed the same while the denominator decreased, resulting in a larger value.

Now, to compare 2/3 and 3/5, we can either find a common denominator or convert them to decimals. 

Finding a common denominator:
- The least common denominator for 3 and 5 is 15.
- 2/3 is equivalent to 10/15 (multiplying both numerator and denominator by 5).
- 3/5 is equivalent to 9/15 (multiplying both numerator and denominator by 3).

Compare the ratios of hawks to total birds and of ravens to total birds. Fill in replacing _ with the correct sign (either &lt;, &gt;, or =).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down this problem:

* **Hawks:** The ratio 4 out of every 6 means that for every 6 birds, 4 are hawks. This can be represented as the fraction 4/6.

* **Ravens:** The ratio 6 out of every 10 means that for every 10 birds, 6 are ravens. This can be represented as the fraction 6/10.

Now we need to compare 4/6 and 6/10. 

Simplifying the fractions:
* 4/6 simplifies to 2/3.
* 6/10 simplifies to 3/5.

To compare 2/3 and 3/5, we can find a common denominator:

* The least common denominator for 3 and 5 is 15.
* 2/3 is equivalent to 10/15.
* 3/5 is equivalent to 9/15.

Since 10/15 is greater than 9/15, we know 2/3 is greater than 3/5.

Therefore:

* We already know from the previous problem that (9/6) is equivalent to 36/24.
* Convert the second fraction (4/8) to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 24: (4/8) * (3/3) = 12/24.
* Now we can compare: 36/24 &gt; 12/24 

Even though we reduced the numerator of the second fraction from our last problem, the first fraction is still larger than the second.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We can compare the fractions by finding a common denominator. The least common denominator for 6 and 7 is 42. 

*(2 / 6) is equivalent to (2 * 7) / (6 * 7) = 14 / 42
*(8 / 7) is equivalent to (8 * 6) / (7 * 6) = 48 / 42

Since 14 is less than 48, we know that 14/42 &lt; 48/42

(2 / 7) _ (8 / 7)

This time, instead of 2 out of 6 parts of a pizza, suppose you only got 2 out of 7 parts while the rest was still 8 out of 7. What would be the comparison between the two fractions then?

        Great! Now, let's consider a minor change. Compare the following two fractions and fill in the blank with one of the symbols &lt;, &gt;, or =:

(4 / 6) _ (5 / 3)

How does the result change compared to the previous problem when we increase the numerator in the second fraction from 6 to 5?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
* Simplifying (5/3), we get a mixed number: 1 and 2/3.  
* (4/6) can be simplified to 2/3.
* Comparing, we see that while both fractions have the same numerator, (2/3) is less than 1 and 2/3.

Result: Increasing the numerator in the second fraction from 6 to 5 actually *decreases* the overall value of the fraction. This is because we're dividing 5 into three parts, which results in smaller parts than dividing 6 into three parts.
