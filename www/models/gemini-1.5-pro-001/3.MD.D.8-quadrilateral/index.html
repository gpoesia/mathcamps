        The perimeter of a rectangular swimming pool is 324 meters. The length of the pool is 83 meters. What is the width of the pool?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let W be the width of the pool. 
The perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * length + 2 * width, so 324 = 2*83 + 2*W
This simplifies to 324 = 166 + 2W
Subtracting 166 from both sides gives us 158 = 2W.
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us W = 79 meters.

        A rectangle has a perimeter of 194 cm. The length of one of its sides is 49 cm. Can you determine the length of its other side?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let the length of the other side be 'l' cm.
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by 2 * (length + width).
So, 2 * (49 + l) = 194 cm.
This simplifies to 98 + 2l = 194 cm.
Further simplifying, 2l = 194 - 98 = 96 cm.
Therefore, l = 96 / 2 = 48 cm.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Let 'l' represent the length and 'w' represent the width of the rectangle. We know l = 4 meters and the perimeter is 52 meters.  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by the formula: 2*l + 2*w = Perimeter.  We can plug in the values we know: 2 * 4 meters + 2 * w = 52 meters. Simplifying, we get 8 meters + 2 * w = 52 meters. Subtracting 8 meters from both sides: 2 * w = 44 meters. Dividing both sides by 2: w = 22 meters.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and width: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).
We know the perimeter is 128 meters and the width is 57 meters.  Let the length be represented by 'l'.  We can set up an equation: 128 = 2 * (l + 57).
Simplify the equation: 128 = 2l + 114.
Subtract 114 from both sides: 14 = 2l.
Divide both sides by 2 to isolate 'l': l = 7.
Therefore, the length of the other side is 7 meters.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let the length of the other side be 'l'. 
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by 2(l+b), where l is the length and b is the breadth. 
We know the perimeter is 204m and one side is 16m. So, 2(l + 16) = 204
Simplifying the equation: 2l + 32 = 204
                                            2l = 204 - 32
                                            2l = 172

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let W be the width of the rectangle.
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 * (length + width).
We know the perimeter is 150 feet and the length is 69 feet.
So, 150 = 2 * (69 + W)
Simplifying, 150 = 138 + 2W
Subtracting 138 from both sides, we get 12 = 2W

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let 'w' represent the width of the rectangle. 
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
We know the perimeter is 138 feet and the length is 46 feet. Let's plug these values into the formula: 138 = 2 * (46 + w)
Simplifying the equation: 138 = 92 + 2w
Subtracting 92 from both sides: 138 - 92 = 2w
This simplifies to: 46 = 2w
Dividing both sides by 2 to isolate 'w': 46 / 2 = w
Therefore, the width (w) is 23 feet.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let the length of the longer side be L.
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(length + width). 
We are told the perimeter is 384cm and the shorter side is 99cm.
We can therefore write the equation 384 = 2 * (L + 99).
Solving for L:
* 192 = L + 99
* 192 - 99 = L
* 93 = L
Therefore, the length of the longer side is 93cm

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal opposite sides, the total length of the known sides is 33*2 = &lt;&lt;33*2=66&gt;&gt;66 feet.
The total length of the other two sides of the rectangle is 96-66 = &lt;&lt;96-66=30&gt;&gt;30 feet.

        The perimeter of a rectangle is 242 meters. Knowing that one of the sides of this rectangle is 97 meters, can you determine the length of the other side?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the unknown side length as 'l'.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides: 2 * length + 2 * width = perimeter.

We know the perimeter is 242 meters and one side is 97 meters.  Let's plug these values into the formula: 2 * 97 + 2 * l = 242

Simplifying the equation: 194 + 2l = 242

To isolate 'l', subtract 194 from both sides: 2l = 48

Finally, divide both sides by 2 to find the length of the other side: l = 24 meters

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let the length of the adjacent side be  'x' cm.
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by 2 * (length + width).
So, 2 * (78 + x) = 224
Simplifying the equation: 156 + 2x = 224
                                           2x = 224 - 156
                                           2x = 68
                                             x = 68/2 = 34

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width).
We know the perimeter is 198 cm and the length is 90 cm.  Let's substitute these values into the formula and solve for the width:

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The two sides that are 47 feet each sum up to 47*2 = &lt;&lt;47*2=94&gt;&gt;94 feet.
That leaves 128-94 = &lt;&lt;128-94=34&gt;&gt;34 feet of perimeter for the other two sides.
Since the other two sides are opposite sides of a rectangle, they must be equal in length, meaning each of the remaining sides should be 34/2 = &lt;&lt;34/2=17&gt;&gt;17 feet long.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let the length of the other side be *l* meters. 
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by 2 * (length + width). We know the perimeter is 98m and one side is 5m. 
We can set up the equation: 2 * (5 + *l*) = 98
Simplifying the equation: 10 + 2*l* = 98
Solving for *l*: 2*l* = 88

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The two sides of the rectangle with the known measurement give us 45*2 = &lt;&lt;45*2=90&gt;&gt;90m of the perimeter.
This leaves 210-90 = &lt;&lt;210-90=120&gt;&gt;120m of the perimeter for the other two sides.
Since the other two sides are equal in length, each of the other two sides is 120/2 = &lt;&lt;120/2=60&gt;&gt;60m.
