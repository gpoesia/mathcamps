        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        In their game, Kyle threw a ball for a distance of 18/4 yards, while Lisa threw the same ball for a distance of 19/9 yards. How many yards did the ball travel in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  First find the sum of the two fractions: 18/4 + 19/9
The two fractions have unlike denominators so we must find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 4 and 9 is 36.
Multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction 18/4 by 9/9 to get (18*9)/(4*9) = 162/36.
Multiply the numerator and denominator of the second fraction 19/9 by 4/4 to get (19*4)/(9*4) = 76/36.
Now we can add the two fractions: 162/36 + 76/36 = 238/36
Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 2: 238/2 = 119 and 36/2 = 18, so 238/36 = 119/18
This is an improper fraction, so convert to a mixed number: 119/18 = 6 11/18
### Answer: 6 11/18 yards

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        After both Kyle and Lisa's throws, the ball bounced an additional 3/13 yards. Subtract this distance from the total distance the ball traveled when Kyle and Lisa threw it. What is the remaining distance?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to subtract 3/13 yards from the total distance the ball traveled when Kyle and Lisa threw it, which is 6 11/18 yards.

First, convert the mixed number 6 11/18 to a fraction: 
(6 * 18 + 11) / 18 = 119/18.

Now, find a common denominator for 18 and 13, which is 234.

Convert 119/18 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 234:
(119 * 13) / (18 * 13) = 1547/234

Convert 3/13 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 234:
(3 * 18) / (13 * 18) = 54/234

Finally, subtract the two fractions:
1547/234 - 54/234 = 1493/234

Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1: 1493/234

Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number: 1493/234 = 6 89/234

### Answer: 6 89/234 yards

        In their game, suppose that Kyle actually threw the ball for a distance of 15/4 yards, while Lisa still threw the ball for 19/9 yards. How many yards did the ball travel in total now?

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to calculate 15/4 + 19/9.
The fractions have unlike denominators, so we find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 4 and 9 is 36.
Multiply the numerator and denominator of 15/4 by 9/9 to get (15*9)/(4*9) = 135/36.
Multiply the numerator and denominator of 19/9 by 4/4 to get (19*4)/(9*4) = 76/36.
Now we can add the fractions: 135/36 + 76/36 = 211/36.
Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number: 211/36 = 5 31/36

        Johnnie the monkey was given 18/7 bananas by the zookeeper in the morning, and 12/14 bananas in the afternoon. In total, how many bananas were given to Johnnie the monkey?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To determine the total number of bananas given to Johnnie, we need to add the number of bananas he received in the morning to the number he received in the afternoon. This requires us to find the sum of two fractions. 

First, find a common denominator for the two fractions: the least common multiple of 7 and 14 is 14.  To get a denominator of 14 for the first fraction, multiply both numerator and denominator by 2: (18/7) = (18*2)/(7*2) = 36/14. The second fraction already has the denominator of 14: 12/14.

Now, we can add the two fractions: 36/14 + 12/14 = (36+12)/14 = 48/14

The resulting fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:  (48/14) = (48/2) / (14/2) = 24/7

        In addition to the bananas given to Johnnie the monkey in the morning and afternoon, the zookeeper decides to give Johnnie the same total amount of bananas the next day. How many bananas in total did Johnnie the monkey receive over these two days?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We know Johnnie received 24/7 bananas over the course of the first day.  Since he receives the same amount on the second day, we need to add the two-day totals together. This can be represented as (24/7) + (24/7).

Since the two fractions already share a common denominator, we simply add the numerators: (24+24)/7 = 48/7 

### Answer: 48/7 bananas

        The bottom of a door measures 4/19 inches from the floor, and the top of the door measures 9/10 inches from the ceiling. What is the total distance of the bottom and top of the door from the floor and ceiling, respectively?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance, we need to add the distance from the bottom of the door to the floor and the distance from the top of the door to the ceiling: 4/19 inches + 9/10 inches

To add fractions, they must have a common denominator.  The least common denominator for 19 and 10 is 190. 

(4/19)*(10/10) + (9/10)*(19/19) = 40/190 + 171/190 = 211/190

        If we consider the distance from the floor and ceiling for both the front and back doors, which have the same measurements as the original door, what is the total distance considering the bottoms and tops of both doors from the floor and ceiling respectively?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Since both the front and back doors have the same measurements, the total distance for both doors is simply double the distance of one door.

We previously found the total distance for one door to be 211/190 inches.

Therefore, the total distance for both doors is (211/190 inches) * 2 = 422/190 inches

This can be simplified to 211/95 inches

        If we reconsider the original scenario with the bottom of a door measuring 4/16 inches from the floor instead of 4/19 inches, and the top still measuring 9/10 inches from the ceiling, what is the new total distance of the bottom and top of the door from the floor and ceiling, respectively?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We will follow the same process as before, but now with the bottom of the door being 4/16 of an inch from the floor.

First, we add the two distances: 4/16 inches + 9/10 inches

Next, we find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 16 and 10 is 80.

We convert each fraction to have a denominator of 80:
(4/16)*(5/5) + (9/10)*(8/8) = 20/80 + 72/80

Finally, we add the two fractions: 20/80 + 72/80 = 92/80

This fraction can be simplified to 23/20

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First we need to simplify 3/18 by dividing the numerator and denominator by 3: 3/18 = 1/6.
Then we subtract the extra juice from the unused portion: 142/33 - 1/6 = (142*2)/(33*2) - (1*11)/(6*11) = 284/66 - 11/66 = 273/66 liters.

        A rocket was launched into orbit. On the first day, it traveled 15/3 light years. On the second day, it traveled an additional 2/7 light years. How far has the rocket traveled in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To determine the total distance, we need to add the distances traveled on each day. 

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 3 and 7. The least common denominator is 21.
Converting 15/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 21: (15/3) * (7/7) = 105/21
Converting 2/7 to a fraction with a denominator of 21: (2/7) * (3/3) = 6/21

Now, we can add the distances: 105/21 + 6/21 = 111/21

Therefore, the rocket has traveled 111/21 light years in total.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We need to add the distances traveled on both days, keeping in mind the updated information.

First, we need a common denominator for our fractions. The least common denominator for 3 and 7 is 21.
We convert 15/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 21: (15/3) * (7/7) = 105/21
We also convert 18/7 to a fraction with a denominator of 21: (18/7) * (3/3) = 54/21

Now, we add the two distances: 105/21 + 54/21 = 159/21.

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3: (159/3) / (21/3) = 53/7. 

Therefore, the rocket has traveled 53/7 light years in total.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add the fractions, they must share a common denominator. The least common denominator is the least common multiple of 13 and 19, which is 247.
10/13 is equivalent to (10 * 19)/(13 * 19) = 190/247
16/19 is equivalent to (16 * 13)/(19 * 13) = 208/247
Adding these two fractions, we get (190 + 208)/247 = 398/247 of the treasure map.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Captain Silverbeard already has 398/247 of the map.  We need to add 15/17 to this fraction. First, we need to find a common denominator.  The least common multiple of 17 and 247 is 4199.

398/247 is equivalent to (398 * 17) / (247 * 17) = 6766 / 4199
15/17 is equivalent to (15 * 247) / (17 * 247) = 3705 / 4199

Adding these two fractions, we get (6766 + 3705) / 4199 = 10471 / 4199 of the treasure map. This fraction is improper (the numerator is larger than the denominator), meaning Captain Silverbeard has more than one complete map.

        Suppose instead of finding 10/13 of the treasure map at the first shipwreck site, Captain Silverbeard found a larger piece which was 10/9 of the total map. Keeping the second portion from the other shipwreck site the same at 16/19, what is the total portion of the treasure map that he found now?

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Similar to the previous problem, we need to find a common denominator to add 10/9 and 16/19. The least common denominator for 9 and 19 is their product, 171.

10/9 is equivalent to (10 * 19)/(9 * 19) = 190/171
16/19 is equivalent to (16 * 9)/(19 * 9) = 144/171

Adding these two fractions, we get (190 + 144)/171 = 334/171 of the treasure map.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to figure out the total distance the hiker traveled North and South. We can do this by subtracting the distance traveled South from the distance traveled North: 9/6 miles - 8/14 miles = 39/42 miles.

Simplifying this, we find that the hiker traveled a net distance of 13/14 miles North. 

Next, we add the distance traveled East to the total distance traveled North to find the total distance traveled: 13/14 miles + 2/16 miles = 57/56 miles

Simplifying this, we get 1 1/56 miles

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: In order to subtract fractions, they need to have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 9 and 13 is 117. We can see that 117/9 = 13, and 117/13 = 9, so we will multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by 13, and the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 9. This gives us (16*13)/(9*13) - (4*9)/(13*9) = 208/117 - 36/117.
Now that the fractions have a common denominator, we can subtract them to get 208/117 - 36/117 = 172/117 cubic feet of sand remaining in the sandbox.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator between the amount of sand Jessica started with and the amount she added. The least common denominator between 15 and 117 is 585. We get this by noticing that 585/117 = 5 and 585/15 = 39. Therefore, we will multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by 5 and the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 39. This gives us (172*5)/(117*5) + (19*39)/(15*39) = 860/585 + 741/585.
Now that both fractions share a common denominator, we can add them together to get 860/585 + 741/585 = 1601/585 cubic feet.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for our two fractions. The least common denominator for 9 and 8 is 72. We can see that 72/9 = 8 and 72/8 = 9, so we will multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by 8, and the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 9. This gives us (16*8)/(9*8) - (4*9)/(8*9) = 128/72 - 36/72.
Now, we can subtract the two fractions: 128/72 - 36/72 = 92/72

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The charcoal burns for a total of (1/5) * 8 = 8/5 hours. 
Converting 8/5 hours to a mixed number, we get 1 3/5 hours. 
Adding this to the previous burn time, the total burn time is 1 7/12 + 1 3/5 = 3 11/60 hours.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of paint, we need to add the amount of blue paint and white paint.
That means we need to add the fractions 18/11 and 1/8. Before we can add fractions, they need to have a common denominator. 
The least common denominator for 11 and 8 is 88. So 18/11 is equivalent to 18/11 * 8/8 = 144/88, and 1/8 is equivalent to 1/8 * 11/11 = 11/88. 
Therefore 18/11 + 1/8 = 144/88 + 11/88 = 155/88.

First, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 88 and 13 is 1144. 
So 155/88 is equivalent to 155/88 * 13/13 = 2015/1144, and 12/13 is equivalent to 12/13 * 88/88 = 1056/1144. 
Therefore 155/88 + 12/13 = 2015/1144 + 1056/1144 = 3071/1144.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To solve this, we need to subtract the length Mark cut off (13/12 feet) from the original length (19/2 feet). Before we can subtract, we need a common denominator.

The least common denominator for 2 and 12 is 12. Let's convert 19/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 12: 
(19/2) * (6/6) = 114/12

Now we can subtract: 
(114/12) - (13/12) = 101/12 feet

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Mark's sleeping bag is currently 101/12 feet long, and he wants to cut off another 13/14 feet.  To do this, we need to subtract 13/14 from 101/12. First, find a common denominator for 12 and 14, which is 84.

Convert 101/12 and 13/14 to fractions with a denominator of 84:
(101/12) * (7/7) = 707/84
(13/14) * (6/6) = 78/84

Now we can subtract:
(707/84) - (78/84) = 629/84 feet

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to simplify 8/2, which is equal to 4.  We need to figure out how much 4 feet is in terms of twelfths to subtract 13/12 from it. 

Since there are twelve inches in a foot, then 4 feet is the same as 4*12 = &lt;&lt;4*12=48&gt;&gt; 48 inches. This means 4 is equal to 48/12.

Now, we can subtract: (48/12)-(13/12) = 35/12.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We will follow similar steps as before, but start with 8/14 instead of 5/14.

1. **Common Denominator:** The least common denominator for 14 and 19 is still 266.
2. **Convert Fractions:**
   *  Convert 8/14 to 152/266.
   *  18/19 is still 252/266.
3. **Add the Fractions:** 152/266 + 252/266 = 404/266

        Reconsider the previous scenario, but this time the turtle returns 15/8 of a meter back towards the starting point instead of the former 15/15 meters. Now, how many meters is the turtle from its starting point after these two movements?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The turtle moves back 15/8 meters, which is more than 1 meter but less than 2 meters. 
To find the remaining distance, subtract the backward movement from the initial northward movement: 11 - 15/8 = 88/8 - 15/8 = 73/8 meters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the weight of the newly found gold (7/11 ounces) to his existing total (19/8 ounces).
To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator for 8 and 11 is 88.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add the fractions, we need a common denominator for 12 and 8, which is 24. So, 10/12 hour is equivalent to (10/12) * (2/2) = 20/24 hour and 3/8 hour is equivalent to (3/8) * (3/3) = 9/24 hour. The total time spent watching is (20/24) + (9/24) = 29/24 hours.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the new length, we need to subtract the shortened amount from the original length: 13/5 - 15/16. 
To subtract fractions, they need a common denominator, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 16.  The LCM of 5 and 16 is 80.
We get equivalent fractions with a denominator of 80: (13/5)*(16/16) = 208/80 and (15/16)*(5/5)=75/80.
Now we can subtract: 208/80 - 75/80 = 133/80

The equivalent fraction for 1/10 is (1/10)*(8/8) = 8/80.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We have to subtract the weight of fertilizers used for the roses from the initial weight of fertilizers: 19/6 kg - 17/20 kg.
To subtract the two fractions, they must have the same denominator.
The least common multiple of 6 and 20 is 60. Thus, we have 19/6 = (19*10)/(6*10) = 190/60, and 17/20 = (17*3)/(20*3)=51/60.
Therefore, 19/6 kg - 17/20 kg = 190/60 kg - 51/60 kg = 139/60 kg.

She found 11/11 kg which simplifies to 1 kg.
Therefore, Miss Daisy now has 139/60 kg + 1 kg of fertilizer.
To add these quantities, we need a common denominator.  Since 1 = 60/60, we have 139/60 kg + 60/60 kg = 199/60 kg.

Now, find a common denominator for 16 and 9, which is 144: 
(4/16 * 9/9) + (10/9 * 16/16) = 36/144 + 160/144 = 196/144 meters.

        At a circus, a clown rode a unicycle for 9/8 hours. After a short break, she juggled for another 2/10 hours. How many hours in total did she perform?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find a common denominator for the fractions 9/8 and 2/10. The least common denominator is 40. 
The fraction 9/8 is equivalent to (9/8) * (5/5) = 45/40
The fraction 2/10 is equivalent to (2/10) * (4/4) = 8/40. 
She performed for (45/40) + (8/40) = 53/40 hours
The fraction 53/40 can be rewritten as the mixed number 1 13/40.

        Following her performances, the clown took a total break of 13/5 hours. How many hours remained after her performance time is subtracted from her total break time?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to subtract the clown's performance time (53/40 hours) from her total break time (13/5 hours).
First, we need to find a common denominator for these fractions. The least common denominator for 5 and 40 is 40.
The fraction 13/5 is equivalent to (13/5)*(8/8) = 104/40.
Therefore, the remaining break time is (104/40) - (53/40) = 51/40 hours
This can be represented by the mixed number 1 11/40.

The fraction 9/10 is equivalent to (9/10) * (4/4) = 36/40
She performed for (45/40) + (36/40) = 81/40 hours

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add the weight of the sand, we first need to have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 2 and 20 is 20. 
Therefore, we need to rewrite 7/2 as an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 20. We can do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 10: (7/2) * (10/10) = 70/20. 
Now we can add the weight of the added sand: 70/20 kg + 1/20 kg = 71/20 kg.

The following day, John adds a third tent to the campsite. This tent occupies 1/10 of an acre. What is the total area occupied by all three tents?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find the sum of the areas of all three tents: 13/11 + 8/20 + 1/10.
To add these fractions, we first need to find a common denominator.  The least common denominator for 11, 20, and 10 is 220.
We convert each fraction as follows: 13/11 = 260/220, 8/20 = 88/220, and 1/10 = 22/220.
Now, we can add the fractions: 260/220 + 88/220 + 22/220 = 370/220.
Finally, we simplify the fraction 370/220 to 37/22 or 1 15/22.

        In the previous scenario, John had initially set up a large tent that occupied an area of 13/11 acres and a smaller tent which occupied an area of 8/20 acres. Instead, if John had a different small tent that occupied an area of 10/20 acres, what would be the total area occupied by these tents?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We need to add the area of the large tent to the area of the small tent. That is 13/11 + 10/20. 
Before adding, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common denominator is 220, so 13/11 becomes 260/220, and 10/20 becomes 110/220. 
Now we can add the fractions: 260/220 + 110/220 = 370/220.
Finally, we can simplify the fraction 370/220 to 37/22 or 1 15/22.

        Captain Jack has a treasure map that shows the treasure is at a location that is (17 / 20) km to the East and then (15 / 3) km to the North from their starting point. How far must they travel in total to reach the treasure?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We must use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem.
The Pythagorean Theorem states: a² + b² = c²
In this case, a = (17 / 20) km  and b = (15 / 3) km
Let's calculate (17 / 20)² = 289 / 400
Let's calculate (15 / 3)² = 225 / 9 = 25
So, c² = (289 / 400) + 25 = (289 / 400) + (10000 / 400) = 10289 / 400
Now we take the square root of both sides to find c: c = √(10289 / 400) = 101.43 / 20 = 5.07 km

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To determine the total pounds of firewood collected, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 11/20 and 9/7. The least common denominator is 140.

Converting 11/20 to a fraction with a denominator of 140: (11/20) * (7/7) = 77/140

Converting 9/7 to a fraction with a denominator of 140: (9/7) * (20/20) = 180/140

Adding the two fractions: 77/140 + 180/140 = 257/140

Simplifying the fraction 257/140, we get 1 117/140.

Let's convert 9/7 to a fraction with a denominator of 140: (9/7)*(20/20) = 180/140
Now, we can add our fractions together: 70/140 + 180/140 = 250/140.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We need to subtract the distance Captain Bill traveled south from the total distance he traveled north. This means we need to subtract 20/17 miles from 23/5 miles.

First, we need to find a common denominator:

* We can rewrite 23/5 as  391/85 (23 * 17 = 391)
* We can rewrite 20/17 as 100/85 (20 * 5 = 100)

        John spends 12/7 hours fixing a watch and then spends an additional 3/9 hours polishing it. How many hours in total did he spent working on the watch?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total time, we need to add the time spent on each task: 12/7 hours + 3/9 hours.

Before adding, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common denominator for 7 and 9 is 63.

Converting 12/7 to a fraction with a denominator of 63: (12/7) * (9/9) = 108/63
Converting 3/9 to a fraction with a denominator of 63: (3/9) * (7/7) = 21/63

Now we can add the fractions: 108/63 + 21/63 = 129/63

Simplifying the fraction: 129/63 = 43/21 = 2 1/21

        After fixing and polishing the watch, John spends an extra 12/13 hours adjusting its mechanism. How many hours in total did he spend working on the watch overall?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know John spent 2 1/21 hours fixing and polishing the watch. To find the total time, we need to add the additional time spent on adjustments: 2 1/21 hours + 12/13 hours.

First, convert the mixed number to a fraction: 2 1/21 = (2 * 21 + 1)/21 = 43/21

Next, find a common denominator for 21 and 13. The least common denominator is 273.

Converting 43/21 to a fraction with a denominator of 273: (43/21) * (13/13) = 559/273
Converting 12/13 to a fraction with a denominator of 273: (12/13) * (21/21) = 252/273

Now we can add the fractions: 559/273 + 252/273 = 811/273

Simplifying the fraction: 811/273 =  3 8/273

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total time, we need to add the time spent on each task: 12/7 hours + 3/15 hours.

Before adding, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common denominator for 7 and 15 is 105.

Converting 12/7 to a fraction with a denominator of 105: (12/7) * (15/15) = 180/105
Converting 3/15 to a fraction with a denominator of 105: (3/15) * (7/7) = 21/105

Now we can add the fractions: 180/105 + 21/105 = 201/105

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

That means she has 1 - 4/75 = &lt;&lt;1-4/75= 71/75&gt;&gt; 71/75 of the 5/4 miles remaining. 
Therefore, Peggy is (71/75) * (5/4) = &lt;&lt;(71/75)*(5/4)=71/60&gt;&gt; 71/60 miles away from her family.

        During a rainy day, the first rainfall lasted for 4/13 hours, and the next rainfall was a little longer and lasted for 11/5 hours. How many hours did it rain in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total rainfall we have to add the duration of both rainfalls: 4/13 + 11/5
To add fractions, they must have the same denominator. The least common denominator for 13 and 5 is 65. So, we convert both fractions:
4/13 = 20/65 and 11/5 = 143/65. 
Finally, we add both fractions: 20/65 + 143/65 = 163/65

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the rainfall from the first day, which was 163/65 hours, to the rainfall of the second day, which was 11/19 hours:  163/65 + 11/19.
To add these fractions, they need a common denominator.  The least common denominator for 65 and 19 is 1235.
We convert both fractions: 163/65 = 3197/1235 and 11/19 = 715/1235
Finally, we add the fractions: 3197/1235 + 715/1235 = 3912/1235

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of magic dust, we need to add the amount used on the field to the amount used on the grove: 11/12 + 9/10.

First find a common denominator for 12 and 10, which is 60.
Then convert each fraction to have a denominator of 60:
- 11/12 = 55/60
- 9/10 = 54/60 

Now add the two fractions: 55/60 + 54/60 = 109/60

- 9/10 = 54/60

Add the fractions: 55/60 + 54/60 = 109/60 oz

Now, subtract the amount used (109/60 oz) from the initial amount (14/3 oz). First, convert 14/3 to have a denominator of 60:
- 14/3 = 280/60

Finally, subtract: 280/60 - 109/60 = 171/60 oz

We need to find the sum of 3/20 and 9/4, so we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The Least Common Multiple of 20 and 4 is 20. We can multiply 9/4 by 5/5 to get 45/20
3/20 + 45/20 = 48/20
We can simplify 48/20 to get 12/5, which is equal to 2 2/5

        In the first hour, a shark swims 3/9 miles and in the second hour height increases its speed to swim 13/5 miles. How many miles does the shark swim in total in these two hours?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance, we need to add the distances from each hour. So, the total distance is 3/9 miles + 13/5 miles. 
To add these fractions, they need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 9 and 5 is 45.
Converting 3/9 to a fraction with a denominator of 45: (3/9)*(5/5) = 15/45.
Converting 13/5 to a fraction with a denominator of 45: (13/5)*(9/9) = 117/45.
Now we can add the two distances: 15/45 miles + 117/45 miles = 132/45 miles. 
This can be simplified to 44/15 miles.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know from the previous problem that the shark swam a total of 44/15 miles in the first two hours. To find the total distance for three hours, we need to add the distance from the third hour: 44/15 miles + 14/9 miles.
The least common denominator for 15 and 9 is 45.
Converting 44/15 to a fraction with a denominator of 45: (44/15)*(3/3) = 132/45.
Converting 14/9 to a fraction with a denominator of 45: (14/9)*(5/5) = 70/45.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We need to add the distance from the first hour (3/7 miles) to the distance from the second hour (13/5 miles).
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 7 and 5 is 35.
Converting 3/7 to a fraction with a denominator of 35: (3/7)*(5/5) = 15/35.
Converting 13/5 to a fraction with a denominator of 35: (13/5)*(7/7) = 91/35.

* First, simplify the second fraction: 2/12 simplifies to 1/6.

* Now we need the LCM of 17 and 6, which is 102.

* This means the first beat (16/17 seconds) will need to be multiplied by 6, and the second beat (1/6 seconds) will need to be multiplied by 17 to have matching denominators.

*  Therefore, it takes 102/102 seconds (which equals 1 second) for the first beat to coincide with the second beat.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We follow the same process as before, but this time with the adjusted length of the first segment.
The total length of the flight is now 18/12 + 9/17 miles.
Again, we need a common denominator to add these fractions: (18/12)*(17/17) + (9/17)*(12/12) = 306/204 + 108/204.
Adding the fractions with a common denominator: 306/204 + 108/204 = 414/204.
This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6: (414/6)/(204/6) = 69/34.
The new total length of the butterfly's flight is 69/34 miles.

        After finishing the small art project, Scarlett decides to mix the remaining red paint with 5/7 gallons of yellow paint to make orange paint. How many gallons of paint does she have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
We need to add the remaining red paint, 1 11/20 gallons, to the yellow paint, 5/7 gallons. 
First, convert the mixed number to a fraction: 1 11/20 = 31/20.
To add fractions, they need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 20 and 7 is 140. 
Adjusting both fractions: (31/20)*(7/7) = 217/140 and (5/7)*(20/20) = 100/140.
Now, add the fractions: 217/140 + 100/140 = 317/140.
Finally, simplify the fraction to a mixed number: 317/140 = 2 37/140 gallons.

        Suppose Scarlett initially had 16/10 gallons of red paint. But this time, she uses 2/20 of a gallon for her small project instead. How many gallons of red paint does she have left now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to convert 16/10 to a fraction with a denominator of 20: (16/10) * (2/2) = 32/20
Now, subtract the amount used for the project: 32/20 - 2/20 = 30/20.
Finally, simplify the fraction 30/20 to a mixed number: 30/20 = 3/2 = 1 1/2 gallons.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 20 and 7 is 140.
So, 9/20 is equivalent to 63/140 and 11/7 is equivalent to 220/140.
Therefore, the alien travelled a total of 63/140 + 220/140 = 283/140 light years.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First we need to calculate the total distance the alien traveled in the first two parts of the journey.  We can do this by adding the two fractions, which we previously found to be a total of 283/140 light years.

Next, we can simplify the third distance, 14/2 light years, to 7 light years. 

To make it easier to add this distance to the first two, we can express it with a denominator of 140: 7 light years is equivalent to 980/140 light years.

Therefore, the total distance the alien travelled is 283/140 + 980/140 = 1263/140 light years.
