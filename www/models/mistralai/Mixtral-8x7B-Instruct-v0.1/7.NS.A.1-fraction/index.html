        Math problem: Determine the value of the sum when adding (74 / 63) and (91 / 78).
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions (74 / 63) and (91 / 78), we first need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 63 and 78 is 513.

So, we convert (74 / 63) to have a denominator of 513 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 8: (74 x 8) / (63 x 8) = 592 / 504

We also convert (91 / 78) to have a denominator of 513 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 7: (91 x 7) / (78 x 7) = 637 / 546

Now, we can add the two fractions: 592 / 504 + 637 / 546 = (592 x 546) / (504 x 546) + (637 x 504) / (546 x 504) = (592 x 546 + 637 x 504) / 277728 = 1229 / 277728

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 94/5 and 1/25, we need to get them to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 25 is 50, so we convert 94/5 to 94*10/50 = 188/50 and 1/25 to 1*2/50 = 2/50.
Then, we add the fractions: 188/50 + 2/50 = (188+2)/50 = 190/50.
Finally, we simplify the fraction: 190/50 = 19/5.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we calculate the value of 48/20, which simplifies to 12/5. Then, we calculate the value of 49/8. To subtract these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 40 in this case. So, we convert 49/8 to 195/40 and 12/5 to 48/40. Now, we can subtract the fractions: 195/40 - 48/40 = 147/40. We simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7: 147/7 = 21 and 40/7 = 5.6.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 22/49 and 72/35, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 49 and 35 is 3990.
So, we convert 22/49 to 110/3990 and 72/35 to 2052/3990.
Then, we add the fractions: 110/3990 + 2052/3990 = 2162/3990.
Finally, we simplify the fraction: 2162/3990 simplifies to 1081/1995.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the value of (39 / 9) which is equal to 39 / 9 = &lt;&lt;39/9=4.33333333333&gt;&gt;4.33333333333 (rounded to 11 decimal places).
Next, we need to calculate the value of (44 / 69) which is equal to 44 / 69 = &lt;&lt;44/69=0.63768115942&gt;&gt;0.63768115942 (rounded to 11 decimal places).
Finally, we need to subtract the second result from the first one: 4.33333333333 - 0.63768115942 = &lt;&lt;4.33333333333-0.63768115942=3.69565217391&gt;&gt;3.69565217391 (rounded to 11 decimal places).

        Calculate the sum of 49/79 and 18/21.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 49/79 and 18/21, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 79 and 21 is 1629.

49/79 = 49 * (1629 / 79) / 1629 = 657/1629

18/21 = 18 * (1629 / 21) / 1629 = 1212/1629

Now, we can add the fractions:

657/1629 + 1212/1629 = (657 + 1212) / 1629 = 1869 / 1629

        What is the sum of 95/46 and 65/31?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 95/46 and 65/31, we need to get them over a common denominator. The least common multiple of 46 and 31 is 1406. So, convert each fraction to have this common denominator.

95/46 = (95 \* 31) / (46 \* 31) = 2955/1406
65/31 = (65 \* 46) / (31 \* 46) = 2990/1406

Now, add the two fractions:

2955/1406 + 2990/1406 = (2955 + 2990) / 1406 = 5945/1406

The fraction 5945/1406 is greater than 4, so we can simplify it to a mixed number: 5945/1406 = 4 1/1406.

However, since the question asks for the sum, and 1/1406 is not a simplified fraction, we will leave the answer as an improper fraction:

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 25/63 and 74/6, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 63 and 6 is 6 * 63 = &lt;&lt;6*63=378&gt;&gt;378.
So, we convert 25/63 to 25 * 6 / 63 = 150 / 378 and 74/6 to 74 * 63 / 6 = 4662 / 378.
Now, we can add the fractions: 150 / 378 + 4662 / 378 = (150 + 4662) / 378 = 4812 / 378.

Now, we subtract 9/47 from it: (4812 / 378) - (9 / 47)
To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 378 and 47 is 378 * 47.
So, we convert 9/47 to 9 * 378 / 47 = 3402 / 378.
Now, we can subtract the fractions: (4812 / 378) - (3402 / 378) = (4812 - 3402) / 378 = 1410 / 378.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To subtract two fractions, we need to get a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator of 70 and 5 is 350.
So, we convert 11/5 to 11 \* 70/5 \* 70 = 494/350 and 79/70 to 79 \* 5/70 \* 5 = 395/350.

68/16 = (68 \* 78) / 16 / 78 = 544/1224
52/78 = (52 \* 16) / 78 / 16 = 832/1224
Then, we add the fractions: 544/1224 + 832/1224 = (544 + 832) / 1224 = 1376/1224

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add two fractions, we need to have the same denominator. The least common denominator of 20 and 97 is 1940.
So, convert each fraction to have this denominator:
23/20 = (23 \* 97) / (20 \* 97) = 2231 / 1940
82/97 = (82 \* 20) / (97 \* 20) = 1640 / 1940
Now, add the fractions:
2231 / 1940 + 1640 / 1940 = (2231 + 1640) / 1940 = 3871 / 1940
Simplify the fraction:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 54/88 and 28/10, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 88 and 10 is 440.
So, we convert 54/88 to 54*5/88*5 = 270/440 and 28/10 to 28*44/10*44 = 1232/440.
Then, we add the two fractions: 270/440 + 1232/440 = (270 + 1232)/440 = 1502/440.
Finally, we simplify the fraction: 1502/440 = 751/220.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We found in the previous question that the sum of 54/88 and 28/10 is 751/220.
Now, we need to add this fraction to 21/13.
To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 220 and 13 is 2860.
So, we convert 751/220 to 751*13/220*13 = 9763/2860 and 21/13 to 21*220/13*220 = 4820/2860.
Then, we add the two fractions: 9763/2860 + 4820/2860 = (9763 + 4820)/2860 = 14583/2860.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 15/32 and 65/15, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 32 and 15 is 480. So, we convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 480.

15/32 = (15 \* 15) / (32 \* 15) = 225/480
65/15 = (65 \* 32) / (15 \* 32) = 2080/480

Now, we can add the fractions:

225/480 + 2080/480 = (225 + 2080) / 480 = 2305/480

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

2305 / 5 = 461 and 480 / 5 = 96

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We first need to find the sum of 15/32 and 65/15, which we found in the previous problem to be 461/96.

Now, we need to find the sum of 87/26 and 461/96. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 26 and 96 is 2448. So, we convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 2448.

87/26 = (87 \* 93) / (26 \* 93) = 8081/2448
461/96 = (461 \* 25) / (96 \* 25) = 11525/2448

Now, we can add the fractions:

8081/2448 + 11525/2448 = (8081 + 11525) / 2448 = 19606/2448

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

19606 / 2 = 9803 and 2448 / 2 = 1224

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 82/15 and 100/12, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 12 is 60, so we convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

82/15 becomes (82 \* 4) / 60 = 328/60
100/12 becomes (100 \* 5) / 60 = 500/60

Now, we can add the fractions:

328/60 + 500/60 = 828/60

We simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

828/60 = 414/30

Finally, we simplify the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:

41 / 33 = about 1.24, but as a remainder it is 41 - (33 \* 1) = 8
Now, add the whole numbers and divide the sum of the remainders by the common denominator:
3 + 1 + 8 / 29 = 4 + 8 / 29 = 4 remainder 8

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 61/20 and 29/15, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 15 is 60. So, we convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

61/20 = (61 \* 3)/(20 \* 3) = 183/60
29/15 = (29 \* 4)/(15 \* 4) = 116/60

Now, we can add the fractions:

183/60 + 116/60 = (183 + 116)/60 = 309/60

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

309/60 = 103/20

(77 / 79) is already in simplest form.
Now, we add the two results:
(11 / 30) + (77 / 79)
To add the fractions, we need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 30 and 79 is 2370.
(11 * 79) / 2370 + (77 * 30) / 2370
1069 / 2370 + 2310 / 2370

So, we convert 2471/474 to 2471*300/474*300 = 741300/143250 and 44/75 to 44*1904/75*1904 = 80256/143250.
Then, we subtract the fractions: 741300/143250 - 80256/143250 = (741300-80256)/143250 = 661044/143250.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The fractions have different denominators, so we need to find a common denominator to add them. The least common multiple of 4 and 89 is 89*4 = 356.
We can convert 43/4 to 43*(89/89) / 4 = (43*89)/356 = 3807/356.
We can convert 71/89 to 71*4/89*4 = 284/356.
Now we can add the fractions: 3807/356 + 284/356 = (3807+284)/356 = 4091/356.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions, we need to have a common denominator. In this case, the least common multiple of 74 and 27 is 2054. So, we convert the fractions to have this common denominator:

17/74 = (17 \* 27) / 2054 = 459 / 2054
53/27 = (53 \* 74) / 2054 = 3922 / 2054

Now, we can add the fractions:

459 / 2054 + 3922 / 2054 = (459 + 3922) / 2054 = 4381 / 2054

The fraction 4381/2054 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 19:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Calculate the two expressions in parentheses:
94 / 14 = 47 / 7
50 / 90 = 5 / 9

Now, subtract the two simplified fractions:
(47 / 7) - (5 / 9)

To subtract fractions, the denominators must be the same. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 9, which is 63. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator of (47 / 7) by 9 to get 423 / 63. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator of (5 / 9) by 7 to get 35 / 63.

Now, subtract the two fractions:
423 / 63 - 35 / 63 = (423 - 35) / 63 = 388 / 63

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 4:
388 / 4 = 97
63 / 4 = 15.75

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Calculate the two expressions in parentheses:

50 / 19 is already in its simplified form.

Now, subtract the two fractions:
(47 / 7) - (50 / 19)

To subtract fractions, the denominators must be the same. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 19, which is 133. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator of (47 / 7) by 19 to get 893 / 133. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator of (50 / 19) by 7 to get 350 / 133.

Now, subtract the two fractions:
893 / 133 - 350 / 133 = (893 - 350) / 133 = 543 / 133

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:
543 / 3 = 181
133 / 3 = 44.33333333333

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> To subtract twenty-nine seventy-ninths from thirty-three sevenths, we first need to convert both numbers to a common denominator. The least common multiple of 79 and 7 is 553.

Thirty-three sevenths is equal to 33*7/7 = 231/7 = 231/553.
Twenty-nine seventy-ninths is equal to 29*553/79/553 = 16477/553.

Now, we can subtract: 231/553 - 16477/553 = (231-16477)/553 = -16246/553.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 60/79 and 53/38, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 79 and 38 is 2932.
Then, convert 60/79 to have a denominator of 2932: (60/79)\*(2932/2932) = 147280/2932.
Similarly, convert 53/38 to have a denominator of 2932: (53/38)\*(2932/2932) = 202876/2932.
Now, add the fractions: 147280/2932 + 202876/2932 = (147280 + 202876)/2932 = 350156/2932.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this fraction equation, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 39/48 and 19/84. The least common multiple of 48 and 84 is 252, so we convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

39/48 = (39 \* 5) / (48 \* 5) = 195 / 252
19/84 = (19 \* 3) / (84 \* 3) = 57 / 252

Now, we can add the fractions:

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 49/75 and 88/58, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 75 and 58 is 4350.

49/75 = (49 \* 60) / 4350 = 2940 / 4350
88/58 = (88 \* 75) / 4350 = 6600 / 4350

Now, we can add the fractions:

2940 / 4350 + 6600 / 4350 = (2940 + 6600) / 4350 = 9540 / 4350

Simplifying the fraction:

9540 / 4350 = 318 / 145

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> To add the fractions 37/69 and 67/61, we first need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 69 and 61 is 4299.

Now, convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 4299:

37/69 = (37 \* 61) / (69 \* 61) = 2257/4299

67/61 = (67 \* 69) / (61 \* 69) = 4603/4299

Now, add the two fractions:

2257/4299 + 4603/4299 = (2257 + 4603) / 4299 = 6860/4299

The fraction 6860/4299 is already in simplest form, but it can be expressed as a mixed number: 1 2560/4299.

The first fraction, 51/78, can be written as (51 \* 83) / 6494 = 4203/6494.
The second fraction, 44/83, can be written as (44 \* 78) / 6494 = 3432/6494.

Now, we can add the two fractions: 4203/6494 + 3432/6494 = (4203 + 3432) / 6494 = 7635/6494.

The fraction 7635/6494 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1: 7635/6494 is already in its simplest form.

52 can be factored as 2^2 * 13. Therefore, 31/52 cannot be simplified further.

Now, subtract the two values:

97/56 - 31/52 = (97*2)/(56*2) - 31/52 = 194/112 - 31/52 = (194-31)/52 = 163/52.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 19/30 and 75/77, we need to get them over a common denominator. The least common multiple of 30 and 77 is 2310.
So, we convert 19/30 to 19\*77/30\*77 = 1483/2310 and 75/77 to 75\*30/77\*30 = 2250/2310.
Now, we can add the fractions: 1483/2310 + 2250/2310 = (1483+2250)/2310 = 3733/2310.
To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3733 and 2310. The GCD is 1.
So, the fraction 3733/2310 cannot be simplified further.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator of 90 and 26 is 90*26 = 2340.
So, (26/90) + (50/26) = (26\*1 + 50\*36)/90*26 = 186 + 1800 / 2340 = 1986 / 2340 = 1\*1620 + 186 / 2\*1170 + 186 = 3480/2340 = 3/2.

80/98 = (80 \* 151) / 14898 = 12120 / 14898

92/82 = (92 \* 180) / 14898 = 16560 / 14898

Now, we can add the fractions:

12120 / 14898 + 16560 / 14898 = (12120 + 16560) / 14898 = 28680 / 14898

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions, we need to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 92 and 74 is 6704. So, we convert the fractions to have this common denominator:

99/92 = (99 x 74) / (92 x 74) = 7336 / 6704

15/74 = (15 x 92) / (74 x 92) = 1380 / 6704

Now, we can add the fractions:

7336 / 6704 + 1380 / 6704 = (7336 + 1380) / 6704 = 8716 / 6704

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD of 8716 and 6704 is 8. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 8, we get:

8716 / 6704 = (8716 / 8) / (6704 / 8) = 1089 / 838

62/30 = 62/30 \* 1/1 = 62/30

Now we can add the fractions:

54/1 + 62/30 = 841/15

Then, we subtract 53/41 from this result:

(841/15) - (53/41)

To subtract the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 41 is 595. So, we convert both fractions to have this denominator:

841/15 = 841 \* 39/15 \* 39 = 325999/595

53/41 = 53 \* 15/41 \* 15 = 1185/595

Now we can subtract the fractions:

(325999/595) - (1185/595) = (325999 - 1185)/595 = 324814/595

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        If we had originally started with 93 instead of 54, and added 62/30 to that, what would be the new result? Express the answer in simplest terms.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 93/1 and 62/30, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1 and 30 is 30, so we convert both fractions to have this denominator:

93/1 = 93 \* 30/1 \* 30 = 2790/30

62/30 = 62/30 \* 1/1 = 62/30

Now we can add the fractions:

2790/30 + 62/30 = (2790 + 62)/30 = 2852/30

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

2852/30 = 713/7.5

### Answer: 713/7.5</pre>

        What value do you get by adding 85/29 and 47/7?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 85/29 and 47/7, we need to get them over a common denominator. The least common multiple of 29 and 7 is 203, so we convert the fractions to have this denominator:

85/29 = 85/29
47/7 = (47 \* 4) / (7 \* 4) = 188/28

Now we can add the fractions:

85/29 + 188/28 = (85 + 188) / 29 = 273/29

### Answer: 273/29</pre>
