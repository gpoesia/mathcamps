        In a school competition, Aliyah correctly guesses 11 letter games and then correctly guesses 7 more games. But when she guesses the next game, she loses 6 times. What is the total number of letter games Aliyah correctly guessed in the end?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Aliyah correctly guessed 11+7 = &lt;&lt;11+7=18&gt;&gt;18 letter games before she started losing.
Aliyah lost 6 times, but since she only lost games, the number of games she correctly guessed remains the same.
Therefore, Aliyah correctly guessed a total of 18 letter games.

        The distance from Earth to the Sun is typically about 11 Astronomical Units. If we were to travel an additional 9 Astronomical Units beyond the sun, how many Astronomical Units away would we be from Earth?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The distance from Earth to the Sun is 11 Astronomical Units. If we travel an additional 9 Astronomical Units beyond the Sun, we would be 11 + 9 = &lt;&lt;11+9=20&gt;&gt;20 Astronomical Units away from the Sun.
Since the distance from Earth to the Sun is 11 Astronomical Units, we would be 20 - 11 = &lt;&lt;20-11=9&gt;&gt;9 Astronomical Units away from Earth.
