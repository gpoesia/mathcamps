        Math problem: Determine the value of the sum when adding (74 / 63) and (91 / 78).

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the value of the sum, we first need to find the value of each fraction and then add them together.

(74 / 63) = &lt;&lt;74/63=1.1746031746031746&gt;&gt;1.1746031746031746
(91 / 78) = &lt;&lt;91/78=1.1666666666666667&gt;&gt;1.1666666666666667

Now, we add the two values together:

1.1746031746031746 + 1.1666666666666667 = &lt;&lt;1.1746031746031746+1.1666666666666667=2.34127&gt;&gt;2.34127

48/20 = (48/5)/(20/4) = (48/5)/5 = 48/25
49/8 = (49/7)/(8/7) = 7/8

        What is the sum of 22/49 and 72/35? Provide your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 49 and 35 is 343.

22/49 = (22 * 7)/(49 * 7) = 154/343
72/35 = (72 * 9)/(35 * 9) = 648/343

Now we can add the two fractions:

154/343 + 648/343 = (154 + 648)/343 = 802/343

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

Therefore, the sum of 22/49 and 72/35 is 802/343.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 79 and 21 is 1659.

49/79 = (49 \* 21)/(79 \* 21) = 1029/1659

18/21 = (18 \* 79)/(21 \* 79) = 1422/1659

Now we can add the fractions:

1029/1659 + 1422/1659 = (1029 + 1422)/1659 = 2451/1659

The fraction 2451/1659 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

2451/1659 = (2451/3)/(1659/3) = 817/553

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: From the previous problem, we know that n = 817/553.

To add 71/97 to n, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 553 and 97 is 53641.

817/553 = (817 \* 97)/(553 \* 97) = 79279/53641

71/97 = (71 \* 553)/(97 \* 553) = 39283/53641

Now we can add the fractions:

79279/53641 + 39283/53641 = (79279 + 39283)/53641 = 118562/53641

The fraction 118562/53641 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

49/3 = (49 \* 7)/(3 \* 7) = 343/21

18/21 = (18 \* 1)/(21 \* 1) = 18/21

Now we can add the fractions:

343/21 + 18/21 = (343 + 18)/21 = 361/21

The fraction 361/21 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

65/31 = (65 \* 46)/(31 \* 46) = 2990/1426

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        In the previous question, we added 95/46 and 65/31. But what if we used 31/46 instead of 95/46? What's the result when we add 31/46 and 65/31?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 31/46 and 65/31, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 46 and 31 is 1426.

31/46 = (31 \* 31)/(46 \* 31) = 961/1426
65/31 = (65 \* 46)/(31 \* 46) = 2990/1426

Now we can add the two fractions:

961/1426 + 2990/1426 = (961 + 2990)/1426 = 3951/1426

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 25/63 and 74/6, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 63 and 6 is 126.

So, we convert 25/63 to 25*2/126 = &lt;&lt;25*2=50&gt;&gt;50/126 and 74/6 to 74*21/126 = &lt;&lt;74*21=1554&gt;&gt;1554/126.

Now, we can add the two fractions: 50/126 + 1554/126 = &lt;&lt;50+1554=1604&gt;&gt;1604/126.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

So, 1604/126 = &lt;&lt;1604/2=802&gt;&gt;802/&lt;&lt;126/2=63&gt;&gt;63.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: From the previous question, we know that the sum of 25/63 and 74/6 is 802/63.

Now, we need to subtract 9/47 from 802/63. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 63 and 47 is 2961.

So, we convert 802/63 to 802*47/2961 = &lt;&lt;802*47=37734&gt;&gt;37734/2961 and 9/47 to 9*63/2961 = &lt;&lt;9*63=567&gt;&gt;567/2961.

Now, we can subtract the two fractions: 37734/2961 - 567/2961 = &lt;&lt;37734-567=37167&gt;&gt;37167/2961.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

So, 37167/2961 = &lt;&lt;37167/3=12389&gt;&gt;12389/&lt;&lt;2961/3=987&gt;&gt;987.

Now, we can add the two fractions: 50/126 + 126/126 = &lt;&lt;50+126=176&gt;&gt;176/126.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

So, 176/126 = &lt;&lt;176/2=88&gt;&gt;88/&lt;&lt;126/2=63&gt;&gt;63.

100/47 = (100 \* 91)/(47 \* 91) = 9100/4277

Now we can add the two fractions:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to simplify the fractions 68/33 and 70/25.

68/33 = &lt;&lt;68/33=2.0606060606060605&gt;&gt;2.0606060606060605
70/25 = &lt;&lt;70/25=2.8&gt;&gt;2.8

Now, we can add the two results:

2.0606060606060605 + 2.8 = &lt;&lt;2.0606060606060605+2.8=4.860606060606061&gt;&gt;4.860606060606061

However, since the question asks for the answer in its simplest form, we can round the result to a reasonable number of decimal places. In this case, we can round to two decimal places:

4.860606060606061 ≈ 4.86

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 97 and 9 is 873.

35/97 = (35 \* 9)/(97 \* 9) = 315/873

11/9 = (11 \* 97)/(9 \* 97) = 1067/873

Now we can add the two fractions:

315/873 + 1067/873 = (315 + 1067)/873 = 1382/873

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

1382/873 is already in its simplest form.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We already found that the sum of 35/97 and 11/9 is 1382/873.

Now we need to add 11/25 to that sum.

First, we need to find a common denominator for 873 and 25. The least common multiple of 873 and 25 is 21825.

1382/873 = (1382 \* 25)/(873 \* 25) = 34550/21825

11/25 = (11 \* 873)/(25 \* 873) = 9603/21825

Now we can add the two fractions:

34550/21825 + 9603/21825 = (34550 + 9603)/21825 = 44153/21825

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

35/97 = (35 \* 15)/(97 \* 15) = 525/1455

11/15 = (11 \* 97)/(15 \* 97) = 1067/1455

Now we can add the two fractions:

525/1455 + 1067/1455 = (525 + 1067)/1455 = 1592/1455

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To subtract 79/70 from 11/5, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 70 and 5 is 70.

So, we convert 11/5 to 154/70 (since 11*14 = 154 and 5*14 = 70).

Now, we can subtract 79/70 from 154/70:

154/70 - 79/70 = (154-79)/70 = &lt;&lt;154-79=75&gt;&gt;75/70

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The previous answer was 15/14.

To add 62/46 to 15/14, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 14 and 46 is 230.

So, we convert 15/14 to 165/230 (since 15*15 = 225 and 14*15 = 210, and 225+5 = 230) and 62/46 to 299/230 (since 62*4 = 248 and 46*4 = 184, and 248+42 = 290, and 290+9 = 299).

Now, we can add 165/230 to 299/230:

165/230 + 299/230 = (165+299)/230 = &lt;&lt;165+299=464&gt;&gt;464/230

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

So, we convert 61/5 to 854/70 (since 61*14 = 854 and 5*14 = 70).

Now, we can subtract 79/70 from 854/70:

854/70 - 79/70 = (854-79)/70 = &lt;&lt;854-79=775&gt;&gt;775/70

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 68/16 and 52/78, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 16 and 78 is 1248.

68/16 = (68*78)/(16*78) = 5304/1248
52/78 = (52*16)/(78*16) = 832/1248

Now we can add the two fractions:

5304/1248 + 832/1248 = (5304+832)/1248 = 6136/1248

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 16:

6136/1248 = (6136/16)/(1248/16) = 383.5/78

383.5/78 = (383.5*19)/(78*19) = 7284.5/1482
37/38 = (37*39)/(38*39) = 1443/1482

        After finding the sum of 60/48 and 37/47, what would you get if you then added 35/35 to your result?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The sum of 60/48 and 37/47 is 1149/564.

Adding 35/35 to this result, we get:

1149/564 + 35/35 = (1149*35)/(564*35) + (35*564)/(35*564) = (40215+19740)/(19740) = 59955/19740

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15.

59955/19740 = (59955/15)/(19740/15) = 3997/1316

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Jane decided to buy 60/45 = &lt;&lt;60/45=4/3&gt;&gt;4/3 kilograms of apples instead of 60/48 = &lt;&lt;60/48=5/4&gt;&gt;5/4 kilograms.

The total weight of the apples and oranges she buys is:

4/3 + 37/47 = (4*47)/(3*47) + (37*3)/(47*3) = 188/141 + 111/141 = (188+111)/141 = 299/141

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 84/97 and 25/2, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 97 and 2 is 194.

84/97 = (84*2)/(97*2) = 168/194
25/2 = (25*97)/(2*97) = 2425/194

Now we can add the two fractions:

168/194 + 2425/194 = (168+2425)/194 = 2593/194

100/71 = (100*19)/(71*19) = 1900/1378

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

18151/1378 - 1900/1378 = (18151-1900)/1378 = 16251/1378

25/2 = (25*48)/(2*48) = 1200/96

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the difference between the fractions 66/20 and 4/78, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 78 is 390.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

66/20 = (66 \* 19.5)/(20 \* 19.5) = 1287/390

4/78 = (4 \* 5)/(78 \* 5) = 20/390

Now, we can find the difference between the two fractions:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The difference between the fractions 66/20 and 4/78 is 1267/390.

To add 6/15 to this result, we first need to find a common denominator for 390 and 15. The least common multiple of 390 and 15 is 1170.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

1267/390 = (1267 \* 3)/(390 \* 3) = 3801/1170

6/15 = (6 \* 78)/(15 \* 78) = 468/1170

Now, we can add the two fractions:

3801/1170 + 468/1170 = (3801 + 468)/1170 = 4269/1170

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

66/21 = (66 \* 6.33)/(21 \* 6.33) = 417.8/133

4/78 = (4 \* 1.7)/(78 \* 1.7) = 6.8/133

        Let's change the previous problem a bit. Instead of adding 6/5, what if we added 6/79 to 77/55? What fraction would we get then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to simplify the fractions.
77/55 = &lt;&lt;77/55=1.4&gt;&gt;1.4
6/79 = &lt;&lt;6/79=0.07594936708860759&gt;&gt;0.07594936708860759 (rounded to 15 decimal places)
Now, we can add the results:
1.4 + 0.07594936708860759 = &lt;&lt;1.4+0.07594936708860759=1.4759493670886076&gt;&gt;1.4759493670886076
To express this as a fraction, we can use the decimal to fraction converter:
1.4759493670886076 = &lt;&lt;1.4759493670886076=14759493670886076/10000000000000000&gt;&gt;14759493670886076/10000000000000000
This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). However, since the denominator is a power of 10, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 23/20 and 82/97, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 97 is 1940.

So, we convert 23/20 to 1102/1940 and 82/97 to 1640/1940.

Now, we can add the two fractions: 1102/1940 + 1640/1940 = 2742/1940.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

So, 2742/1940 = 1371/970.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 88 and 10 is 440.

54/88 = (54 \* 5)/(88 \* 5) = 270/440

28/10 = (28 \* 44)/(10 \* 44) = 1232/440

Now we can add the two fractions:

270/440 + 1232/440 = (270 + 1232)/440 = 1502/440

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

1502/440 = (1502/2)/(440/2) = 751/220

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We have already found that the sum of 54/88 and 28/10 is 751/220.

Now we need to add this to 21/13. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 220 and 13 is 2860.

751/220 = (751 \* 13)/(220 \* 13) = 9763/2860

21/13 = (21 \* 220)/(13 \* 220) = 4620/2860

Now we can add the two fractions:

9763/2860 + 4620/2860 = (9763 + 4620)/2860 = 14383/2860

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

14383/2860 = (14383/1)/(2860/1) = 14383/2860

First, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 26 and 480 is 7280.

87/26 = (87\*280)/(26\*280) = 24360/7280
2305/480 = (2305\*15)/(480\*15) = 34575/7280

2400/341 = (2400 \* 35)/(341 \* 35) = 84000/11935
63/35 = (63 \* 341)/(35 \* 341) = 21543/11935

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 12 is 60.

82/15 = (82 * 4) / (15 * 4) = 328/60
100/12 = (100 * 5) / (12 * 5) = 500/60

Now we can add the two fractions:

328/60 + 500/60 = (328 + 500) / 60 = 828/60

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12:

828/60 = (828/12) / (60/12) = 69/5

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: From the previous question, we know that the sum of 82/15 and 100/12 is 69/5.

Now we need to add 46/83 to 69/5. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 83 is 415.

69/5 = (69 * 83) / (5 * 83) = 5727/415
46/83 = (46 * 5) / (83 * 5) = 230/415

Now we can add the two fractions:

5727/415 + 230/415 = (5727 + 230) / 415 = 5957/415

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 12 is 60.

61/15 = (61 * 4) / (15 * 4) = 244/60
100/12 = (100 * 5) / (12 * 5) = 500/60

Now we can add the two fractions:

244/60 + 500/60 = (244 + 500) / 60 = 744/60

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12:

744/60 = (744/12) / (60/12) = 62/5

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, we calculate the two fractions separately:
92 / 29 = &lt;&lt;92/29=3.1724137931034483&gt;&gt;3.1724137931034483
41 / 33 = &lt;&lt;41/33=1.2424242424242424&gt;&gt;1.2424242424242424

Next, we add the two results:
3.1724137931034483 + 1.2424242424242424 = &lt;&lt;3.1724137931034483+1.2424242424242424=4.4148380355276907&gt;&gt;4.4148380355276907

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 29 and 98 is 29 \* 98 = &lt;&lt;29\*98=2842&gt;&gt;2842.

57/29 = (57 \* 98)/(29 \* 98) = &lt;&lt;57\*98=5586&gt;&gt;5586/2842

14/98 = (14 \* 29)/(98 \* 29) = &lt;&lt;14\*29=406&gt;&gt;406/2842

5586/2842 + 406/2842 = (5586 + 406)/2842 = &lt;&lt;5586+406=5992&gt;&gt;5992/2842

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

5992/2842 = (5992/2)/(2842/2) = &lt;&lt;5992/2=2996&gt;&gt;2996/&lt;&lt;2842/2=1421&gt;&gt;1421

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: From the previous problem, we know that the sum of 57/29 and 14/98 is 2996/1421.

To subtract 78/92 from this sum, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1421 and 92 is 1421 \* 92 = &lt;&lt;1421\*92=130612&gt;&gt;130612.

2996/1421 = (2996 \* 92)/(1421 \* 92) = &lt;&lt;2996\*92=275632&gt;&gt;275632/130612

78/92 = (78 \* 1421)/(92 \* 1421) = &lt;&lt;78\*1421=110898&gt;&gt;110898/130612

275632/130612 - 110898/130612 = (275632 - 110898)/130612 = &lt;&lt;275632-110898=164734&gt;&gt;164734/130612

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

164734/130612 = (164734/2)/(130612/2) = &lt;&lt;164734/2=82367&gt;&gt;82367/&lt;&lt;130612/2=65306&gt;&gt;65306

57/29 = (57 \* 26)/(29 \* 26) = &lt;&lt;57\*26=1482&gt;&gt;1482/754

14/26 = (14 \* 29)/(26 \* 29) = &lt;&lt;14\*29=406&gt;&gt;406/754

1482/754 + 406/754 = (1482 + 406)/754 = &lt;&lt;1482+406=1888&gt;&gt;1888/754

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

1888/754 = (1888/2)/(754/2) = &lt;&lt;1888/2=944&gt;&gt;944/&lt;&lt;754/2=377&gt;&gt;377

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the given expression, we need to find the common denominator of the two fractions. The least common multiple of 25 and 28 is 350.

70/25 = (70 * 14) / (25 * 14) = 980 / 350
83/28 = (83 * 12.5) / (28 * 12.5) = 1037.5 / 350

Now we can add the two fractions:

980/350 + 1037.5/350 = (980 + 1037.5) / 350 = 2017.5 / 350

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 17.5.

2017.5 / 17.5 = 115
350 / 17.5 = 20

So the simplified fraction is 115/20.

20/23 = (20 \* 73)/(23 \* 73) = 1460/1679

Now, we need to add 83/35 to this result. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 1679 and 35. The least common multiple of 1679 and 35 is 58765.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

2610/1679 = (2610 \* 35)/(1679 \* 35) = 91350/58765

83/35 = (83 \* 1679)/(35 \* 1679) = 139457/58765

2.6857142857142856 - 0.4693877551020408 = &lt;&lt;2.6857142857142856-0.4693877551020408=2.2163265306122448&gt;&gt;2.2163265306122448
To simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 10000000000000000 to get rid of the decimal point:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 22163265306122448 / 10000000000000000 + 27 / 72 = &lt;&lt;22163265306122448/10000000000000000+27/72=22163265306122448/10000000000000000+27/72&gt;&gt;22163265306122448 / 10000000000000000 + 27 / 72
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 10000000000000000 and 72 is 10000000000000000.
Therefore, we can rewrite the second fraction as 27 \* (10000000000000000 / 72) / 10000000000000000 = &lt;&lt;27\*10000000000000000/72/10000000000000000=375000000000000000/10000000000000000&gt;&gt;375000000000000000 / 10000000000000000.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 30 and 37 is 1110.

58/30 = (58 \* 37)/(30 \* 37) = 2146/1110

49/37 = (49 \* 30)/(37 \* 30) = 1470/1110

Now we can add the two fractions:

2146/1110 + 1470/1110 = (2146 + 1470)/1110 = 3616/1110

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

3616/1110 = (3616/2)/(1110/2) = 1808/555

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: If the sum of 58/30 and 49/37 is represented by the variable 't', then 't' = 3616/1110.

To find the value of 't' added to 't', we simply multiply 't' by 2:

2 \* t = 2 \* (3616/1110) = (2 \* 3616)/1110 = 7232/1110

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

7232/1110 = (7232/2)/(1110/2) = 3616/555

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 53 and 50 is 2650.

45/53 = (45 \* 50) / (53 \* 50) = 2250 / 2650
71/50 = (71 \* 53) / (50 \* 53) = 3763 / 2650

Now we can add the two fractions:

2250/2650 + 3763/2650 = (2250 + 3763) / 2650 = 6013 / 2650

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 13.

6013 / 13 = 462
2650 / 13 = 203.84615384615385

So the simplified fraction is 462/203.84615384615385. However, since the denominator is not a whole number, we can't express the fraction in its simplest form. Therefore, we can leave the answer as 6013/2650.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We already calculated the sum of 45/53 and 71/50 as 6013/2650.

Now we need to add 8/100 to this sum. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 2650 and 100. The least common multiple of 2650 and 100 is 265000.

6013/2650 = (6013 \* 100) / (2650 \* 100) = 601300 / 265000
8/100 = (8 \* 2650) / (100 \* 2650) = 21200 / 265000

Now we can add the two fractions:

601300/265000 + 21200/265000 = (601300 + 21200) / 265000 = 622500 / 265000

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 250.

622500 / 250 = 2490
265000 / 250 = 1060

So the simplified fraction is 2490/1060. However, since the denominator is not a whole number, we can't express the fraction in its simplest form. Therefore, we can leave the answer as 622500/265000.

71/72 = (71 \* 53) / (72 \* 53) = 3763 / 3816

Now we can add the two fractions:

3240/3816 + 3763/3816 = (3240 + 3763) / 3816 = 6903 / 3816

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

6903 / 3 = 2301
3816 / 3 = 1272

So the simplified fraction is 2301/1272. However, since the denominator is not a whole number, we can't express the fraction in its simplest form. Therefore, we can leave the answer as 6903/3816.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 15 is 60.

61/20 = (61\*3)/(20\*3) = 183/60

29/15 = (29\*4)/(15\*4) = 116/60

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We have already found that the sum of 61/20 and 29/15 is 299/60.

Now we need to add that result to 58/31. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 31 is 1830.

299/60 = (299\*30)/(60\*30) = 8970/1830

58/31 = (58\*60)/(31\*60) = 3480/1830

Now we can add the two fractions:

8970/1830 + 3480/1830 = (8970+3480)/1830 = 12450/1830

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 30.

12450/1830 = (12450/30)/(1830/30) = 415/61

        Previously you found the sum of 61/20 and 29/15. Now let's change the 15 in the denominator of the second fraction to 67, so that we are adding 61/20 and 29/67. What will the new sum be?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 67 is 1340.

61/20 = (61\*67)/(20\*67) = 4087/1340

29/67 = (29\*20)/(67\*20) = 580/1340

Now we can add the two fractions:

4087/1340 + 580/1340 = (4087+580)/1340 = 4667/1340

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the expression ((33 / 90) + (77 / 79)), we first need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 90 and 79 is 6210.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

(33 / 90) = (33 \* 69) / (90 \* 69) = 2277 / 6210

(77 / 79) = (77 \* 79) / (79 \* 79) = 6083 / 6210

Now we can add the two fractions:

(2277 / 6210) + (6083 / 6210) = (2277 + 6083) / 6210 = 8360 / 6210

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 79 and 6 is 474.

30/79 = (30 \* 6)/(79 \* 6) = 180/474

29/6 = (29 \* 79)/(6 \* 79) = 2291/474

Now we can add the two fractions:

180/474 + 2291/474 = (180 + 2291)/474 = 2471/474

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We already found the sum of 30/79 and 29/6 to be 2471/474.

Now we need to subtract 44/75 from it. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 474 and 75. The least common multiple of 474 and 75 is 35550.

2471/474 = (2471 \* 75)/(474 \* 75) = 185325/35550

44/75 = (44 \* 474)/(75 \* 474) = 20952/35550

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

185325/35550 - 20952/35550 = (185325 - 20952)/35550 = 164373/35550

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 97 and 6 is 582.

30/97 = (30 \* 6)/(97 \* 6) = 180/582

29/6 = (29 \* 97)/(6 \* 97) = 2813/582

Now we can add the two fractions:

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 66 and 2 is 66.

So, we convert 59/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 66:
59/2 = (59 \* 33)/(2 \* 33) = 1947/66

Now, we can subtract 11/66 from 1947/66:
1947/66 - 11/66 = (1947 - 11)/66 = 1936/66

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
1936/66 = (1936/2)/(66/2) = 968/33

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find the result of subtracting 11/66 from 59/2, which we have already calculated as 968/33.

Now, we can add 63/51 to 968/33. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 51 and 33 is 1683.

So, we convert 63/51 to a fraction with a denominator of 1683:
63/51 = (63 \* 33)/(51 \* 33) = 2079/1683

Now, we can add 2079/1683 to 968/33:
2079/1683 + 968/33 = (2079 \* 33)/(1683 \* 33) + (968 \* 51)/(33 \* 51) = 68427/55491 + 49328/1683 = (68427 + 49328)/55491 = 117755/55491

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 31 and 2 is 62.

So, we convert 59/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 62:
59/2 = (59 \* 31)/(2 \* 31) = 1829/62

Now, we can subtract 11/31 from 1829/62:
1829/62 - 11/31 = (1829 \* 2)/(62 \* 2) - (11 \* 2)/(31 \* 2) = 3658/124 - 22/62

To subtract the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 124 and 62 is 124.

So, we convert 22/62 to a fraction with a denominator of 124:
22/62 = (22 \* 2)/(62 \* 2) = 44/124

Now, we can subtract the fractions:
3658/124 - 44/124 = (3658 - 44)/124 = 3614/124

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
3614/124 = (3614/2)/(124/2) = 1807/62

58/23 = (58 \* 26)/(23 \* 26) = 1508/598

25/26 = (25 \* 23)/(26 \* 23) = 575/598

Now we can add the two fractions:

1508/598 + 575/598 = (1508 + 575)/598 = 2083/598

The sum of the two fractions is 2083/598.

45/23 = (45 \* 26)/(23 \* 26) = 1170/598

Now we can add the two fractions:

1170/598 + 575/598 = (1170 + 575)/598 = 1745/598

The new sum is 1745/598.

To compare the new sum to the original sum, we can subtract the original sum from the new sum:

1745/598 - 2083/598 = (1745 - 2083)/598 = -338/598

459/1998 + 3922/1998 = (459+3922)/1998 = 4381/1998

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To subtract 23/29 from 4381/1998, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1998 and 29 is 57942.

4381/1998 = (4381\*29)/(1998\*29) = 127049/57942

23/29 = (23\*1998)/(29\*1998) = 45954/57942

Now we can subtract the fractions:

127049/57942 - 45954/57942 = (127049-45954)/57942 = 81095/57942

        What is the result of ((94 / 14) - (50 / 90))? Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, simplify the fractions 94/14 and 50/90.
94/14 = &lt;&lt;94/14=6.714285714285714&gt;&gt;6.714285714285714, which can be simplified to 47/7.
50/90 = &lt;&lt;50/90=0.5555555555555556&gt;&gt;0.5555555555555556, which can be simplified to 5/9.
Now, subtract the two fractions: 47/7 - 5/9.
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 9 is 63.
So, we convert the fractions to have a denominator of 63:
47/7 = (47 * 9)/(7 * 9) = 423/63
5/9 = (5 * 7)/(9 * 7) = 35/63
Now, subtract the two fractions: 423/63 - 35/63 = (423 - 35)/63 = 388/63.

50/19 = &lt;&lt;50/19=2.631578947368421&gt;&gt;2.631578947368421, which cannot be simplified further.
Now, subtract the two fractions: 47/7 - 50/19.
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 19 is 133.
So, we convert the fractions to have a denominator of 133:
47/7 = (47 * 19)/(7 * 19) = 893/133
50/19 = (50 * 7)/(19 * 7) = 350/133
Now, subtract the two fractions: 893/133 - 350/133 = (893 - 350)/133 = 543/133.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To subtract twenty-nine seventy-ninths from thirty-three sevenths, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 79 is 553.

Thirty-three sevenths can be written as (33 \* 79)/553 = &lt;&lt;(33 \* 79)/553=2617/553&gt;&gt;2617/553.

Twenty-nine seventy-ninths can be written as (29 \* 7)/553 = &lt;&lt;(29 \* 7)/553=203/553&gt;&gt;203/553.

Subtracting the two fractions, we get (2617/553) - (203/553) = &lt;&lt;(2617/553) - (203/553)=2414/553&gt;&gt;2414/553.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 60/79 and 53/38, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 79 and 38 is 3042.

60/79 = (60 * 38) / (79 * 38) = 2280 / 3042
53/38 = (53 * 79) / (38 * 79) = 4187 / 3042

Now we can add the two fractions:

2280/3042 + 4187/3042 = (2280 + 4187) / 3042 = 6467 / 3042

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

Therefore, the sum of 60/79 and 53/38 is 6467/3042.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this equation, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 48 and 84 is 252.

39/48 = (39*5)/(48*5) = 195/240
19/84 = (19*3)/(84*3) = 57/252

Now we can add the two fractions:

195/240 + 57/252 = (195*7)/(240*7) + (57*10)/(252*10) = 1365/1680 + 570/2520

Since 1680 and 2520 are both multiples of 240, we can simplify the fractions:

1365/1680 = (1365/240)/(1680/240) = 5.6875/7
570/2520 = (570/240)/(2520/240) = 2.375/10.5

Now we can add the two fractions:

5.6875/7 + 2.375/10.5 = (5.6875*10.5)/(7*10.5) + (2.375*7)/(10.5*7) = 60.1875/73.5 + 16.625/73.5

Finally, we can add the two fractions:

60.1875/73.5 + 16.625/73.5 = (60.1875 + 16.625)/73.5 = 76.8125/73.5

(95 / 69) = &lt;&lt;95/69=1.3768&gt;&gt;1.3768 (rounded to four decimal places)
(67 / 9) = &lt;&lt;67/9=7.4444&gt;&gt;7.4444 (rounded to four decimal places)

Now, we can add the two results together:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find the common denominator for the fractions 95/16 and 43/60. The least common multiple of 16 and 60 is 240.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

95/16 = (95 * 15) / (16 * 15) = 1425 / 240
43/60 = (43 * 4) / (60 * 4) = 172 / 240

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

1425 / 240 - 172 / 240 = (1425 - 172) / 240 = 1253 / 240

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

1253 / 240 = 1253 / 240

So, the result of 95 / 16 - 43 / 60 is 1253 / 240.

        After finding the result of 95 / 16 - 43 / 60, add the result to 80 / 79. What is the final answer?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We have already found that the result of 95 / 16 - 43 / 60 is 1253 / 240.

Now, we need to add this result to 80 / 79.

First, we need to find the common denominator for the fractions 1253 / 240 and 80 / 79. The least common multiple of 240 and 79 is 18960.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

1253 / 240 = (1253 * 79) / (240 * 79) = 99067 / 18960
80 / 79 = (80 * 240) / (79 * 240) = 19200 / 18960

Now, we can add the fractions:

99067 / 18960 + 19200 / 18960 = (99067 + 19200) / 18960 = 118267 / 18960

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

118267 / 18960 = 118267 / 18960

So, the final answer is 118267 / 18960.

        After finding the result of 95 / 16 - 43 / 60 in the previous problem, let's change it a bit. What if instead of 95/16, you had 91/16 and you subtracted 43/60 from it? What would the new result be?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can follow the same steps as before, but with the new numerator 91 instead of 95.

First, we find the common denominator for the fractions 91/16 and 43/60, which is 240.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

91/16 = (91 * 15) / (16 * 15) = 1365 / 240
43/60 = (43 * 4) / (60 * 4) = 172 / 240

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

1365 / 240 - 172 / 240 = (1365 - 172) / 240 = 1193 / 240

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

1193 / 240 = 1193 / 240

So, the result of 91 / 16 - 43 / 60 is 1193 / 240.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 59 and 94 is 59 \* 94.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

38/59 = (38 \* 94)/(59 \* 94) = 3572/5546

80/94 = (80 \* 59)/(94 \* 59) = 4720/5546

Now we can add the two fractions:

3572/5546 + 4720/5546 = (3572 + 4720)/5546 = 8292/5546

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We already calculated the sum of 38/59 and 80/94 as 4146/2773.

Now we need to add 84/30 to this sum. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 2773 and 30 is 2773 \* 30.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

4146/2773 = (4146 \* 30)/(2773 \* 30) = 124380/83190

84/30 = (84 \* 2773)/(30 \* 2773) = 232902/83190

Now we can add the two fractions:

124380/83190 + 232902/83190 = (124380 + 232902)/83190 = 357282/83190

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 49/75 and 88/58, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 75 and 58 is 4350.

49/75 = (49\*58)/(75\*58) = 2842/4350

88/58 = (88\*75)/(58\*75) = 6600/4350

Now we can add the two fractions:

2842/4350 + 6600/4350 = (2842+6600)/4350 = 9442/4350

49/75 = (49\*58\*82)/(75\*58\*82) = 2842\*82/356700

88/58 = (88\*75\*82)/(58\*75\*82) = 6600\*82/356700

3/82 = (3\*75\*58)/(82\*75\*58) = 1365/356700

Now we can add the three fractions:

(2842\*82 + 6600\*82 + 1365)/356700 = (232964 + 541200 + 1365)/356700 = 777529/356700

16/75 = (16\*4)/(75\*4) = 64/300

Now we can add the two fractions:

555/300 + 64/300 = (555+64)/300 = 619/300

The fraction 619/300 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 619/300.

        In addition to the previously computed sum of 37/20 and 16/75, now add the fraction 61/80 to this sum. What is the total when all three fractions are added together?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We have already found that the sum of 37/20 and 16/75 is 619/300. Now we need to add the fraction 61/80 to this sum.

To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 300 and 80 is 2400.

619/300 = (619\*8)/(300\*8) = 4952/2400

61/80 = (61\*30)/(80\*30) = 1830/2400

Now we can add the two fractions:

4952/2400 + 1830/2400 = (4952+1830)/2400 = 6782/2400

The fraction 6782/2400 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 3391/1200.

        If there originally were 60/20 portions of a cake and you added 16/75 portions of another cake to it, how much cake would you have in total? Please write your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total amount of cake, we need to add the two fractions. The least common multiple of 20 and 75 is 300.

60/20 = (60\*15)/(20\*15) = 900/300

16/75 = (16\*4)/(75\*4) = 64/300

Now we can add the two fractions:

900/300 + 64/300 = (900+64)/300 = 964/300

The fraction 964/300 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 482/150.

37/69 = (37 \* 61)/(69 \* 61) = 2257/4209
67/61 = (67 \* 69)/(61 \* 69) = 4623/4209

Now we can add the fractions:

2257/4209 + 4623/4209 = (2257 + 4623)/4209 = 6880/4209

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We have already found that the result of the addition of the fractions 37/69 and 67/61 is 6880/4209.

To add 100/7 to this result, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4209 and 7 is 29463.

6880/4209 = (6880 \* 7)/(4209 \* 7) = 48160/29463
100/7 = (100 \* 4209)/(7 \* 4209) = 420900/29463

Now we can add the fractions:

44/83 = (44 \* 78)/(83 \* 78) = 3432/6474

Now we can add the two fractions:

4233/6474 + 3432/6474 = (4233 + 3432)/6474 = 7665/6474

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We already found that the sum of 51/78 and 44/83 is 2555/2158.

Now we need to add that sum to 71/92. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 2158 and 92. The least common multiple of 2158 and 92 is 2158 \* 92.

2555/2158 = (2555 \* 92)/(2158 \* 92) = 235420/2158 \* 92
71/92 = (71 \* 2158)/(92 \* 2158) = 153418/2158 \* 92

Now we can add the two fractions:

235420/2158 \* 92 + 153418/2158 \* 92 = (235420 + 153418)/(2158 \* 92) = 388838/2158 \* 92

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the value of 97 / 56 - 31 / 52, we first need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 56 and 52 is 1456.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

97 / 56 = (97 * 26) / (56 * 26) = 2522 / 1456

31 / 52 = (31 * 28) / (52 * 28) = 868 / 1456

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:

2522 / 1456 - 868 / 1456 = (2522 - 868) / 1456 = 1654 / 1456

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We have already found that 97 / 56 - 31 / 52 = 827 / 728.

Now, we need to add this to 100 / 25.

First, we convert 100 / 25 to have the same denominator as 827 / 728:

100 / 25 = (100 * 29) / (25 * 29) = 2900 / 725

Now, we can add the two fractions:

827 / 728 + 2900 / 725 = (827 * 725) / (728 * 725) + (2900 * 728) / (725 * 728)

To simplify the addition, we can find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 728 and 725 is 528,000.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

(827 * 725) / (728 * 725) = (827 * 725) / 528,000

(2900 * 728) / (725 * 728) = (2900 * 728) / 528,000

Now, we can add the two fractions:

(827 * 725) / 528,000 + (2900 * 728) / 528,000 = (827 * 725 + 2900 * 728) / 528,000

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

(827 * 725 + 2900 * 728) / 528,000 = (827 * 725 + 2900 * 728) / 528,000

        If instead of 31/52 in the previous problem you had 26/52 to subtract from 97/56, what would the new result be? Please express your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the value of 97 / 56 - 26 / 52, we first need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 56 and 52 is 1456.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

97 / 56 = (97 * 26) / (56 * 26) = 2522 / 1456

26 / 52 = (26 * 28) / (52 * 28) = 728 / 1456

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:

2522 / 1456 - 728 / 1456 = (2522 - 728) / 1456 = 1794 / 1456

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

1794 / 1456 = (1794 / 2) / (1456 / 2) = 897 / 728

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The result of the operation (33 / 23) - (12 / 75) can be expressed as a fraction by finding a common denominator for the two fractions. The common denominator for 23 and 75 is 1725.

(33 / 23) - (12 / 75) = (33 \* 75 / 23 \* 75) - (12 \* 23 / 75 \* 23) = (2475 / 1725) - (276 / 1725) = (2475 - 276) / 1725 = 2199 / 1725

The fraction 2199 / 1725 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

2199 / 1725 = (2199 / 3) / (1725 / 3) = 733 / 575

(733 / 575) + (24 / 81) = (733 \* 81 / 575 \* 81) + (24 \* 575 / 81 \* 575) = (59493 / 46575) + (13800 / 46575) = (59493 + 13800) / 46575 = 73293 / 46575

The fraction 73293 / 46575 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

19/30 = (19\*39)/(30\*39) = 741/1155

75/77 = (75\*15)/(77\*15) = 1125/1155

Now we can add the two fractions:

741/1155 + 1125/1155 = (741+1125)/1155 = 1866/1155

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

39/64 = (39 \* 4) / (64 \* 4) = 156/264

Now we can add the two fractions:

228/264 + 156/264 = (228 + 156) / 264 = 384/264

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 24 is 312.
80/13 = (80*24)/(13*24) = 1920/312

Now, we can add the two fractions:
80/5 + 1/24
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 24 is 120.
80/5 = (80*24)/(5*24) = 1920/120
1/24 = (1*5)/(24*5) = 5/120

        In the previous problem, we started with the operation ((55 / 30) - (1 / 72)). Suppose now that we started with 80 instead of 55 in the first fraction. How will the result change when you calculate the new operation ((80 / 30) - (1 / 72))?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we calculate the division operations:
80 / 30 = &lt;&lt;80/30=2.6666666666666665&gt;&gt;2.6666666666666665
1 / 72 = &lt;&lt;1/72=0.013888888888888888&gt;&gt;0.013888888888888888
Next, we subtract the second result from the first:
2.6666666666666665 - 0.013888888888888888 = &lt;&lt;2.6666666666666665-0.013888888888888888=2.6527777777777777&gt;&gt;2.6527777777777777

        Calculate the sum of the fractions 69/21 and 71/86.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 21 and 86 is 21*86 = &lt;&lt;21*86=1786&gt;&gt;1786.

69/21 = (69*86)/(21*86) = &lt;&lt;69*86=5914&gt;&gt;5914/1786
71/86 = (71*21)/(86*21) = &lt;&lt;71*21=1491&gt;&gt;1491/1786

Now we can add the fractions:

5914/1786 + 1491/1786 = (5914+1491)/1786 = &lt;&lt;5914+1491=7405&gt;&gt;7405/1786

The fraction 7405/1786 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

Therefore, the sum of the fractions is 7405/1786.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 45 is 180.

24/60 = (24\*3)/(60\*3) = 72/180
42/45 = (42\*4)/(45\*4) = 168/180

Now we can add the two fractions:

72/180 + 168/180 = (72+168)/180 = 240/180

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 60:

240/180 = (240/60)/(180/60) = 4/3

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: From the previous problem, we know that the sum of 24/60 and 42/45 is 4/3.

Now we need to add this to 66/12. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 12 is 12.

4/3 = (4\*4)/(3\*4) = 16/12
66/12 = 66/12

Now we can add the two fractions:

16/12 + 66/12 = (16+66)/12 = 82/12

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

82/12 = (82/2)/(12/2) = 41/6

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 67 is 2010.

24/60 = (24\*33.5)/(60\*33.5) = 804/2010
42/67 = (42\*30)/(67\*30) = 1260/2010

Now we can add the two fractions:

804/2010 + 1260/2010 = (804+1260)/2010 = 2064/2010

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:

2064/2010 = (2064/6)/(2010/6) = 344/335

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 64/76 and 35/33, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 76 and 33 is 2508.

64/76 = (64 \* 33)/(76 \* 33) = 2112/2508

35/33 = (35 \* 76)/(33 \* 76) = 2660/2508

Now we can add the two fractions:

2112/2508 + 2660/2508 = (2112 + 2660)/2508 = 4772/2508

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.

4772/2508 = (4772/4)/(2508/4) = 1193/627

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We have already found that the sum of 64/76 and 35/33 is 1193/627.

Now we need to find the sum of 1193/627 and 47/38. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 627 and 38 is 23862.

1193/627 = (1193 \* 38)/(627 \* 38) = 45334/23862

47/38 = (47 \* 627)/(38 \* 627) = 29589/23862

Now we can add the two fractions:

45334/23862 + 29589/23862 = (45334 + 29589)/23862 = 74923/23862

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

74923/23862 = (74923/1)/(23862/1) = 74923/23862

43/76 = (43 \* 33)/(76 \* 33) = 1419/2508

35/33 = (35 \* 76)/(33 \* 76) = 2660/2508

Now we can add the two fractions:

1419/2508 + 2660/2508 = (1419 + 2660)/2508 = 4079/2508

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 16 and 10 is 80.

47/16 = (47\*5)/(16\*5) = 235/80

96/10 = (96\*8)/(10\*8) = 768/80

Now, we can add the two fractions:

235/80 + 768/80 = (235+768)/80 = 1003/80

To express this as a mixed fraction, we divide 1003 by 80:

50/26 = (50\*45)/(26\*45) = 2250/1170

338/1170 + 2250/1170 = (338+2250)/1170 = 2588/1170

The fraction 2588/1170 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To calculate the sum of 80/98 and 92/82, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 98 and 82 is 4204.

80/98 = (80 \* 43)/(98 \* 43) = 3440/4204

92/82 = (92 \* 51)/(82 \* 51) = 4692/4204

Now we can add the two fractions:

3440/4204 + 4692/4204 = (3440 + 4692)/4204 = 8132/4204

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.

8132/4204 = (8132/4)/(4204/4) = 2033/1051

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 44 and 5 is 220.

89/44 = (89 * 5) / (44 * 5) = 445/220
69/5 = (69 * 44) / (5 * 44) = 3036/220

Now we can add the two fractions:

445/220 + 3036/220 = (445 + 3036) / 220 = 3481/220

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

3481/220 is already in its simplest form.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The sum of 89/44 and 69/5 is 3481/220.

To find the result of adding this sum to itself, we simply multiply the sum by 2:

2 * (3481/220) = (2 * 3481) / 220 = 6962/220

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

6962/220 = (6962/2) / (220/2) = 3481/110

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 44 and 38 is 748.

89/44 = (89 * 17) / (44 * 17) = 1513/748
69/38 = (69 * 20) / (38 * 20) = 1380/748

Now we can add the two fractions:

1513/748 + 1380/748 = (1513 + 1380) / 748 = 2893/748

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To calculate the expression, we first need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 32 and 55 is 1760.

79/32 = (79 \* 55) / (32 \* 55) = 4345 / 1760
52/55 = (52 \* 32) / (55 \* 32) = 1664 / 1760

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

4345 / 1760 - 1664 / 1760 = (4345 - 1664) / 1760 = 2681 / 1760

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: From the previous problem, we know that 79/32 - 52/55 = 2681 / 1760.

Now we need to add 42/99 to this result.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 1760 and 99 is 173280.

2681 / 1760 = (2681 \* 99) / (1760 \* 99) = 265319 / 173280
42 / 99 = (42 \* 1760) / (99 \* 1760) = 74880 / 173280

Now we can add the two fractions:

265319 / 173280 + 74880 / 173280 = (265319 + 74880) / 173280 = 340199 / 173280

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

7/55 = (7 \* 32) / (55 \* 32) = 224 / 1760

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

15/74 = (15 \* 48)/(74 \* 48) = 720/3518

Now we can add the two fractions:
