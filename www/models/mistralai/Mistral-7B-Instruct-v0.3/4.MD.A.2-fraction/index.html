        Steve started with 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days. Then he received an extra 11 dollars. John started with 18 dollars but then he spent the same amount of money as Steve had. John found 25 dollars on the street. How much money does John have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
1. Steve spent 38/8 = &lt;&lt;38/8=4.75&gt;&gt;4.75 dollars per day for 8 days, so he spent 4.75*8 = &lt;&lt;4.75*8=38&gt;&gt;38 dollars in total.
2. Steve had 0 dollars left after spending, but he received an extra 11 dollars, so he now has 11 dollars.
3. John spent the same amount of money as Steve, so he spent 38 dollars.
4. John found 25 dollars on the street, so he now has 38+25 = &lt;&lt;38+25=63&gt;&gt;63 dollars.

        Sally wants to measure the distance of her bike route. Initially, she hesitates and travels only 47/50 of a mile. Then, she gains confidence and rides another 31 miles. Every day for the next 28 days, she completes the same distance.

One day, she decided to detour and added an extra 32/24 miles to her regular bike route. How many miles in total did she travel after adding the extra traveling distance?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many miles Sally traveled in the 28 days without the detour:
Daily distance = 1 mile (since she completes the same distance every day)
Total distance without detour = Daily distance * Number of days = 1 * 28 = &lt;&lt;1*28=28&gt;&gt;28 miles

Now, let's find out how many miles she traveled during the detour:
Detour distance = 32/24 miles

Finally, let's add the total distance without the detour and the detour distance:
Total distance = Total distance without detour + Detour distance = 28 + 32/24 = &lt;&lt;28+32/24=35.5&gt;&gt;35.5 miles

        A truck can travel a distance of 34/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel. If 11 more kilometers are added to its journey, what is the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel? Then, if an additional 49 kilometers are added to the journey, what would be the total distance then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many liters of fuel the truck needs to travel 34/25 kilometers:
34/25 liters of fuel can travel 34/25 km.

To travel an additional 11 kilometers, the truck needs:
(11 - 34/25) liters of fuel = (11 * 25/34 - 25) liters of fuel = (125/34 - 25) liters of fuel.

Now, let's find the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel:
Total distance = Initial distance + Additional distance = (34/25 + (125/34 - 25)) km.

Simplify the expression:
Total distance = (34/25 + (125 - 25*34/34))/34 km = (34/25 + 100)/34 km = 134/25 km.

Now, let's find the total distance when an additional 49 kilometers are added:
Total distance = Initial distance + Additional distance (first part) + Additional distance (second part) = (134/25 + 49)/34 km.

Simplify the expression:
Total distance = (134/25 + 49*34/34)/34 km = (134/25 + 49)/34 km = 183/25 km.
### Answer:
1. The truck can travel 134/25 kilometers before running out of fuel.
2. With an additional 49 kilometers, the truck can travel 183/25 kilometers.</pre>

        John drank a special energy drink that increased his jogging speed. After the energy drink, he was able to jog 50/49 miles per hour faster. One day, he had a speed of 4/22 miles per hour without the use of the energy drink. After consuming the energy drink, at what rate would he jog if he continued for 46/30 hours?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The increase in speed due to the energy drink is 50/49 miles per hour.
John's speed without the energy drink is 4/22 miles per hour.
The new speed with the energy drink is the sum of his original speed and the increase: (4/22) + (50/49) = (200+49)/99 = 249/99 miles per hour.
To find the speed after 46/30 hours, we multiply the new speed by the time: (249/99) * (46/30) = (9636/297) miles.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many gallons the truck driver added at the first station: 21/36 * 36 = &lt;&lt;21*36/36=21&gt;&gt;21 gallons.
Then, let's find out how many gallons the truck driver added at the second station: 26/42 * 42 = &lt;&lt;26*42/42=26&gt;&gt;26 gallons.
Now, let's add the initial amount of gas and the amounts added at both stations: 9 + 21 + 26 = &lt;&lt;9+21+26=56&gt;&gt;56 gallons.

        John's house is (17 / 3) miles from his work. The supermarket is (25 / 41) miles closer to his work than his house. 

How far is the supermarket from his work?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's first find the distance between the supermarket and John's house. Since the supermarket is (25 / 41) miles closer to his work than his house, we can express the distance between the supermarket and John's house as:

Distance(supermarket - John's house) = Distance(John's house - work) - (25 / 41)

We know that the distance between John's house and work is (17 / 3) miles. So,

Distance(supermarket - John's house) = (17 / 3) - (25 / 41)

To solve this equation, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 3 and 41 is 123. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

(17 / 3) * (41 / 41) / 123 = (123 * 17) / (3 * 41)
(25 / 41) * (3 / 3) / 123 = (3 * 25) / (41 * 123)

Now, we can subtract the second fraction from the first:

Distance(supermarket - John's house) = ((123 * 17) - (3 * 25)) / (3 * 41)

Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 41 to eliminate the fraction:

Distance(supermarket - John's house) = (5089 - 125) / 126

Now, we can simplify the fraction:

Distance(supermarket - John's house) = 4964 / 126

Since the supermarket is (25 / 41) miles closer to John's work than his house, we can find the distance between the supermarket and work by adding this difference to the distance between the supermarket and John's house:

Distance(supermarket - work) = Distance(supermarket - John's house) + (25 / 41)

Plugging in the value we found for the distance between the supermarket and John's house:

Distance(supermarket - work) = (4964 / 126) + (25 / 41)

To solve this equation, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 126 and 41 is 4964. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

(4964 / 126) * (41 / 41) / 4964 + (25 * 126) / (41 * 4964)

Now, we can add the two fractions:

(4964 * 41 + 25 * 126) / (126 * 41)

Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 41 to eliminate the fraction:

(199844 + 3150) / 5276

Now, we can simplify the fraction:

Distance(supermarket - work) = 231344 / 5276

Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8:

Distance(supermarket - work) = 2904

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how much juice is in one part after Roberto split the juice into 17 equal parts.

Total juice = 50 ounces
Juice per part = Total juice / Number of parts = 50 / 17 = &lt;&lt;50/17=2.9411764705882358&gt;&gt;2.94 ounces per part (approximately)

Now, Roberto takes juice from one part and pours it into a container. So, the amount of juice in the container is 2.94 ounces.

Then, Roberto takes 34/44 of what is in that container and pours it into another container.

Amount of juice in the second container = (34/44) * 2.94 ounces = (7/8) * 2.94 ounces = 2.175 ounces (approximately)

        John wants to save some money to buy a video game. The game costs $40, but John already has $29. 

Every week, John is able to save 20/48 of the money he needs. 

After a certain period of time, he decides to put all his savings so far into an investment account. The account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested after a year. 

How much money will John have in his investment account after a year?

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how much money John needs to save to buy the game: $40 - $29 = $11.

Next, let's find out how much John saves per week: 20/48 of the money he needs = (20/48) * $11 = $1.25 per week.

Now, let's find out how many weeks it takes for John to save enough money to buy the game: $11 / $1.25 = 8.64 weeks. Since John can't save a fraction of a week, we'll round up to 9 weeks.

After 9 weeks, John will have saved $1.25 * 9 = $&lt;&lt;1.25*9=11.25&gt;&gt;11.25.

Now, let's find out how much money John will have in his investment account after a year: $11.25 * 41/11 = $&lt;&lt;11.25*41/11=45.04545454545455&gt;&gt;45.05 (rounded to two decimal places).

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we find out how many 1/5 euros Maria has in her pocket. Since she has 13/3 euros, she has 13*(5/3) = &lt;&lt;13*(5/3)=130/3=43.333333333333336&gt;&gt;43.33 euros in 1/5 euros.
Then, she buys a candy bar that costs 32/15 euros. To find out how many 1/5 euros the candy bar costs, we multiply 32/15 by 5/1, which gives us 32*(5/15) = &lt;&lt;32*(5/15)=20/3=6.666666666666667&gt;&gt;6.67 euros in 1/5 euros.
Since Maria starts with 43.33 euros and spends 6.67 euros, she has 43.33 - 6.67 = &lt;&lt;43.33-6.67=36.66&gt;&gt;36.66 euros left.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the speed of the sprinter for both parts combined, we can use the harmonic mean formula for two rates:

Harmonic Mean = 2 * (Rate1 * Rate2) / (Rate1 + Rate2)

Harmonic Mean = 2 * (34/14 * 21/26) / ((34/14) + (21/26))

Harmonic Mean = 2 * (34 * 21) / (34 + 21) * (26 * 14) / (26 * 14)

Harmonic Mean = 2 * (34 * 21) / 55 * (26 * 14) / 364

Harmonic Mean = (684 * 364) / 55 * 364

Harmonic Mean = 253,472 / 55

Harmonic Mean = 4608.727272727273 miles per hour

Since the question asks for the distance covered in one hour, we can multiply the combined speed by 1 hour:

Distance = Harmonic Mean * 1 hour

Distance = 4608.727272727273 miles

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find out how many miles Jenny ran in the second round. To do this, we convert the fraction 11/4 to a common denominator with 32 (which is 128). So, (11/4)*(32/32) = 11*8 = 88 miles.
Then, we add the miles she ran in the first round (41/32) and the miles she ran in the second round (88): (41/32 + 88).
To add the fractions, we find a common denominator (which is 96). So, (41*3*4/32 + 88*4/32) = (123/32 + 352/32) = 475/32.
To convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction, we multiply the whole number part (1) by the denominator (32) and add it to the numerator (123): 1*32 + 123 = 155.
So, Jenny ran a total of 155 + 88 = &lt;&lt;155+88=243&gt;&gt;243 miles.

41/48 \* 1 = 41/48 dollars

Next, let's add the quarter he found:
41/48 + 23/24 = (41*24 + 23*48) / (48*24) = 987/192 dollars

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

Now, let's find her new speed:
New speed = Original speed * (1 + (43/15)) = (32/24) * (1 + (43/15)) = (32/24) * (15/15 + 43/15) = (32/24) * (16/15) = 16/5 miles per hour.

        There are two containers of juice. The first one contains 23/35 gallon. The second one contains 50/41 gallon. 

After mixing the two containers of juice together, it was transferred into a bottle which can hold 28 gallons. 

How much space is left in the bottle after subtracting 11/19 gallon which was drunk by a customer?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we find the total amount of juice in both containers by adding their contents: (23/35 + 50/41) gallons.

To find a common denominator for the fractions, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of 35 and 41, which is 210. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

(23/35) * (6/6) + (50/41) * (5/5) = (138/210) + (250/210) = (388/210) gallons

Now, we subtract the 11/19 gallons that were drunk by the customer:

388/210 - 11/19 = (388 - 11 * (210/19)) / 210 = (388 - 110) / 210 = 278 / 210

Finally, we find the fraction of the bottle that is filled:

(278/210) / (28/1) = (278/210) * (1/28) = 1/210

Since the fraction is less than 1, the bottle is not completely full. To find the space left in the bottle, we subtract the fraction from 1:

1 - (1/210) = 210/210 - 1/210 = 209/210

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how much money Samuel has in total after finding the $30 on the street.
Total money = Initial money + Found money = $17 + $30 = $47
Now, we need to convert this amount to Euros using the given exchange rate of $47 to 33 Euros.

Exchange rate = $47 / 33 = 1.42 Euros per dollar

Total money in Euros = Total money in dollars * Exchange rate = $47 * 1.42 = &lt;&lt;47*1.42=66.94&gt;&gt;66.94 Euros

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

The difference between the initial count and the corrected count is 170 - 135 = &lt;&lt;170-135=35&gt;&gt;35 coins. Since Hannah has 5 piggy banks, the number of coins she found extra is 35 / 5 = &lt;&lt;35/5=7&gt;&gt;7 coins.

        Alex has $13/10 in his pocket. He finds $47/36 on the floor and picks it up adding to the money he already has. If he duplicates the amount of money he has by 43 times, how much money will he have?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find the amount of money Alex has after picking up the money on the floor.

The amount of money Alex has after picking up the money on the floor is $13/10 + $47/36.

To simplify the fraction, we can find the least common multiple of the denominators 10 and 36, which is 120.

So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

$13/10 = $13 * (120/120) / (10 * 120/120) = $13 * 12/10 * 1/120 = $1.5/120

$47/36 = $47 * (120/120) / (36 * 120/120) = $47 * 10/3 * 1/120 = $4.5/120

Now, we can add the amounts of money Alex has:

$1.5/120 + $4.5/120 = $6/120 = $0.05

Now, Alex duplicates the amount of money he has by 43 times:

$0.05 * 43 = $2.15

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many ounces of apple juice John consumes in 8 days. Since he consumes 48 ounces every 42 days, in 8 days he consumes 48/42 * 8 = &lt;&lt;48/42*8=16&gt;&gt;16 ounces of apple juice.

Next, let's find out how many pounds of apples John buys in 8 days. Since he buys 17 pounds every 8 days, in 8 days he buys 17 pounds.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The runner runs 17 miles each day for 49 days.

        A toy car travels 37 kilometers on a single tank of fuel. However, after a modification, the toy car can now travel an additional 33/40 of a kilometer. What is the total distance the toy car can now travel on a single tank of fuel after the modification?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The toy car can travel an additional 33/40 of a kilometer after the modification.
To find the total distance the toy car can travel after the modification, we add the original distance (37 kilometers) to the additional distance (33/40 of a kilometer).
To add the additional distance, we first convert it to a decimal by multiplying 33/40 by 10/10 (since 10/10 = 1).
33/40 * 10/10 = 7.75 kilometers
Now, we add the original distance (37 kilometers) to the additional distance (7.75 kilometers):
37 + 7.75 = &lt;&lt;37+7.75=44.75&gt;&gt;44.75 kilometers

        John traveled for 1/31 of an hour by car and then took a bus for another 30/12 hours. After taking a short break of 17/4 hours, how long in total was John on the move?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, convert the time units to a common denominator (36 hours).
Time traveled by car: (1/31)*36 = &lt;&lt;(1/31)*36=1.1&gt;&gt;1.1 hours
Time taken by bus: 30/12 * (36/4) = 30*3 = &lt;&lt;30*3=90&gt;&gt;90 hours
Time taken for the short break: 17/4 * 36 = 132/4 = &lt;&lt;132/4=33&gt;&gt;33 hours
Total time John was on the move: 1.1 + 90 + 33 = &lt;&lt;1.1+90+33=124.1&gt;&gt;124.1 hours

        Clara had 30 dollars initially. She spent 25/6 dollars on ice cream. After buying the ice cream, she used 11/21 of her remaining money to buy a book. How many dollars did she spend on the book?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how much money Clara had left after buying the ice cream.
Money left = Initial money - Money spent on ice cream
Money left = 30 - (25/6)
Money left = (30*6 - 25) / 6 = 120/6 - 25/6 = 20 - 25/6

Now, let's find out how much money Clara spent on the book.
Money spent on the book = Money left * Money spent on the book as a fraction of the remaining money
Money spent on the book = (20 - 25/6) * (11/21)
Money spent on the book = (20*11 - 25*11)/6*21 = (220 - 255)/6*21 = -35/6*21 = -35*3.5 = &lt;&lt;-35*3.5=122.5&gt;&gt;122.5 dollars

        Walter pays 23/21 dollars for a pen. After buying the pen, he still has 46 dollars left. How much money did he have originally?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's denote the original amount of money Walter had as x dollars.
The equation representing the situation is:
(x - 23/21) = 46

To solve for x, we first multiply both sides of the equation by 21 to eliminate the fraction:
21(x - 23/21) = 21 * 46

This simplifies to:
21x - 23 = 916

Now, we add 23 to both sides of the equation to isolate x:
21x = 939

Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by 21 to find the original amount of money Walter had:
x = 939 / 21

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: First, let's find the cost per bag for the old vendor:
Cost per bag (old vendor) = Cost per 8 bags / 8
Cost per bag (old vendor) = $34 / 8 = $4.25

Now, let's find the cost per bag for the new vendor:
Cost per bag (new vendor) = Cost per 30 bags / 30
Cost per bag (new vendor) = $19 / 30 = $0.6333...

To find the difference in cost per bag, subtract the new cost from the old cost:

        A bottle contains 22/43 liters of juice. If you drink 18/4 of the bottle, how many liters of juice do you drink?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we find out how much juice is left in the bottle after drinking 18/4 of it:

Juice left = Initial juice - Drank juice
= 22/43 - 18/4

To find a common denominator, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 11 (the least common multiple of 4 and 43):

Juice left = (22/43 - 198/443)

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

Juice left = (22*443 - 198*43)/443
= 9662/443

Since we are asked for the amount of juice drunk, we can find it by subtracting the remaining juice from the initial juice:

Juice drunk = Initial juice - Juice left
= 22/43 - 9662/443

To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. We can use the least common multiple of 43 and 443, which is 443:

Juice drunk = (22*1 - 9662*43)/443
= (-9662*42)/443
= -22088/443

Since the juice drunk is negative, it means that the amount of juice drunk is more than the total amount of juice in the bottle. This is not possible, so there seems to be an error in the problem.

### Answer: There is an error in the problem. The amount of juice drunk cannot be more than the total amount of juice in the bottle.</pre>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The time spent on the journey is 43/17 hours, and the time spent on the break is 31/4 hours.
The total time spent on the journey and the break is (43/17 + 31/4) hours.
To find a common denominator, we can multiply the denominators of both fractions: 17*4 = 68.
Now, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
(43/17)*(4/4) + (31/4)*(17/17) = (172/68) + (247/68)

        A turtle travels at a speed of 19/6 feet per second. How far, in feet, would the turtle travel in 24 seconds if it starts 20 feet ahead from the starting point?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The turtle travels a distance of speed * time = (19/6) * 24 = &lt;&lt;(19/6)*24=38 feet&gt;&gt;38 feet in 24 seconds.
Since the turtle starts 20 feet ahead, the total distance traveled is 38+20 = &lt;&lt;38+20=58&gt;&gt;58 feet.

        You have $15 in your savings account. You decided to spend 17/23 of a dollar on a small sweet. How much is left in your savings account after buying the sweet?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The fraction 17/23 can be converted to a decimal by dividing 17 by 23.
17/23 ≈ 0.7391304347826087

To find out how much money is spent on the sweet, we multiply the decimal by the initial amount of money:

Money spent = Initial amount * Fraction spent
= $15 * 0.7391304347826087
= $11.08945625614558

Now, to find out how much is left in the savings account, we subtract the amount spent from the initial amount:

Money left = Initial amount - Money spent
= $15 - $11.08945625614558
= $3.91054374385442

### Answer: $3.91

Note: The answer is rounded to two decimal places for simplicity. The exact value is $3.91054374385442.</pre>
