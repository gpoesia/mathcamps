    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say there were x craters on the moon before the new ones were spotted. After spotting 3 new craters, there are now 10 craters in total. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 3 = 10

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us:

x = 7

So, there were 7 craters on the moon before the new ones were spotted.

        Peter had 10 shirts in his closet. After buying a new shirt, he found out he only had one shirt before the purchase. How many shirts did he buy?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say Peter bought x shirts. He initially had 10 shirts, and after buying x shirts, he had 1 shirt left. This means that the total number of shirts he has now is 1 + x.
We know that the total number of shirts he has now is equal to the initial number of shirts he had (10) plus the number of shirts he bought (x). So, we can set up the equation:

1 + x = 10 + x

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

1 = 10

This is not possible, as Peter cannot have only 1 shirt after buying some shirts. This means that our initial assumption that Peter bought x shirts is incorrect.

Let's try again. Let's say Peter bought y shirts. He initially had 10 shirts, and after buying y shirts, he had 1 shirt left. This means that the total number of shirts he has now is 1 + y.
We know that the total number of shirts he has now is equal to the initial number of shirts he had (10) minus the number of shirts he had before the purchase (1). So, we can set up the equation:

1 + y = 10 - 1

Simplifying the equation gives us:

y = 9

So, Peter bought 9 shirts.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of strawberries Grace picked from the good area is x. Since she already had 2 strawberries, and she ended up with a total of 10 strawberries, we can set up the equation:

2 + x = 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 2
x = 8

So, Grace picked 8 strawberries from the good area.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Daisy arranged 10 shapes in a line, and she lined up 5 circles. This means she has 10 - 5 = 5 shapes left to arrange.
Since she has 5 shapes left, and she wants to fill the rest of the line, she must use all 5 shapes for the rest of the line. Since the problem asks how many squares she used for the rest of the line, and there is no information about the other shapes, we can assume that the remaining 5 shapes are all squares.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Amy has 10 tomatoes in total, and 2 of them are green tomatoes. To find the number of red tomatoes, we subtract the number of green tomatoes from the total number of tomatoes.

10 (total tomatoes) - 2 (green tomatoes) = 8

So, Amy has 8 red tomatoes.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The rocket ship needs 10 kilograms of fuel to launch, and 7 kilograms are already filled. To find out how many more kilograms are needed, we subtract the amount already filled from the total amount needed:

10 (total needed) - 7 (already filled) = 3

So, 3 kilograms of fuel are needed to fulfill the requirement.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the total number of parts is represented by the variable x. We know that the propellant tank and the engines make up 3 parts, and the total number of parts is 10. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x - 3 = 10

To solve for x, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation:

x = 10 + 3
x = 13

So, the total number of parts is 13. Since we know that the propellant tank and the engines make up 3 parts, we can subtract 3 from the total number of parts to find the number of additional parts:

13 - 3 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 additional parts in the rocket.

        Sophie has 10 scoops of ice cream in her bowl. If 3 of them are vanilla, how many scoops of chocolate ice cream does she have?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since Sophie has 10 scoops of ice cream in total, and 3 of them are vanilla, the remaining scoops are not vanilla. Let's subtract the number of vanilla scoops from the total number of scoops: 10 - 3 = 7.
This means Sophie has 7 scoops of ice cream that are not vanilla, and since we know that the remaining scoops are not vanilla, we can conclude that all 7 scoops are chocolate.

        In a fairy kingdom, there are 10 pixies. 3 of them have blue wings. How many pixies have green wings?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since there are 10 pixies in total, and 3 of them have blue wings, the remaining pixies must have green wings.
To find the number of pixies with green wings, subtract the number of pixies with blue wings from the total number of pixies:
10 (total pixies) - 3 (pixies with blue wings) = 7

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Sara has already composed 5 bars, and the total piece is 10 bars long. To find out how many more bars she needs to compose, we subtract the number of bars she has already composed from the total number of bars:

10 (total bars) - 5 (bars already composed) = 5

So, Sara still needs to compose 5 more bars.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since Rachel has 10 candles in total, and 8 of them are scented, the number of unscented candles can be found by subtracting the number of scented candles from the total number of candles.

10 (total candles) - 8 (scented candles) = 2

So, Rachel has 2 unscented candles.
