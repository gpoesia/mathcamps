    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Captain Paul had 3 boats initially. He gave away the same number of boats that Captain Jake has, which is 2 boats (as we found out earlier).

So, Captain Paul gave away 2 boats, which means he has 3 - 2 = 1 boat left.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Captain Jake started with 2 boats and purchased another boat, so we need to add the number of boats he had initially to the number of boats he purchased.

Let's say the number of boats he purchased is x. Then, the total number of boats Captain Jake has now is 2 + x.

Since he purchased one more boat, we know that x is equal to 1 (because he purchased one more boat). Therefore, the total number of boats Captain Jake has now is 2 + 1 = 3.

        Let's consider a different situation. Suppose that Johnny started the day with just 1 pink eraser. Later in the morning, a friend gives him another pink eraser, bringing his total count up. In the afternoon, his teacher gives him yet another eraser. How many erasers does Johnny have now?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Johnny starts with 1 pink eraser.
He receives 1 more pink eraser from his friend, so he now has 1 + 1 = 2 pink erasers.
His teacher gives him another eraser, so he now has 2 + 1 = 3 pink erasers.

It makes 2 complete rotations, which means it is now pointing in a direction 2 rotations away from north.
It is then spun back by 1 rotation in the same direction, which means it is now pointing in a direction 1 rotation away from north.
Since it was 2 rotations away from north and spun back 1 rotation, it is now 1 rotation away from north.

        Earlier, Sarah found 3 marshmallows around the campfire and then found 1 more marshmallow. Now, let's say Sarah initially found only 1 marshmallow around the campfire but still found 1 more in her marshmallow bag like before. How many marshmallows does Sarah have now?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Sarah found 1 marshmallow initially around the campfire.
She then found 1 more marshmallow in her bag.
The total number of marshmallows Sarah found is the sum of the initial 1 and the additional 1: 1 + 1 = &lt;&lt;1+1=2&gt;&gt;2.

        In the morning, James finds 2 socks under his bed. He picks up 1 sock and puts it in the laundry basket. After that, he goes back to check under the bed. How many socks are there under the bed now?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, James finds 2 socks under his bed.
He picks up 1 sock and puts it in the laundry basket, which means he removes 1 sock from under the bed.
So, there are 2 - 1 = &lt;&lt;2-1=1&gt;&gt;1 socks left under the bed now.

        Let's say originally before James and his brother started their actions, there were not 2 but 4 socks under the bed. If James still picks up 1 sock and puts it in the laundry basket, how many socks would be left under the bed then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, there are 4 socks under the bed.
James picks up 1 sock and puts it in the laundry basket, which means he removes 1 sock from under the bed.
So, there are 4 - 1 = &lt;&lt;4-1=3&gt;&gt;3 socks left under the bed now.

        The train station has four platforms, but two of them are currently under maintenance. How many platforms are available for use?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The train station has 4 platforms initially, but 2 of them are under maintenance, which means they are not available for use. To find the number of platforms available for use, we subtract the number of unavailable platforms from the total number of platforms.

4 (total platforms) - 2 (unavailable platforms) = 2

        Given the previous situation where two platforms are currently in use, an equal number of platforms become operational later in the day. How many working platforms are there now at the train station?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, there were 2 platforms available for use. Later, an equal number of platforms (2) become operational, which means they are now available for use.

The number of platforms available for use increases by 2, so we add 2 to the initial number of available platforms:

2 (initial available platforms) + 2 (newly operational platforms) = 4

        There are 3 birds singing in the forest. Then, 1 bird flies away. After a while, the same number of squirrels come and join the two remaining birds. How many animals are there in total in the forest now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, there are 3 birds. Then, 1 bird flies away, leaving 3 - 1 = 2 birds.
The same number of squirrels come and join the 2 remaining birds, so 2 + 2 = 4 animals join.
There are 2 birds and 4 animals (squirrels) in total, which is 2 + 4 = 6 animals.
