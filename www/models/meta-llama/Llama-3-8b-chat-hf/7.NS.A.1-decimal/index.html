    <pre class="model-raw-response">If there were originally 20 oranges, and we add 15.7 apples, the total amount would be:

20 (oranges) + 15.7 (apples) = ?

Since apples are not oranges, we can't combine them directly. We need to keep track of the oranges and apples separately.

Let's add the apples to the oranges:

20 (oranges) + 15.7 (apples) = 20 (oranges) + 15 (apples) + 0.7 (remaining apples)

We can't add apples to oranges, so we'll keep the oranges as 20. The apples become 15 + 0.7 = 15.7.

So, the total amount is:

20 oranges + 15.7 apples

1. Start with the number 97.75.
2. Subtract 92 from that number:

97.75 - 92 = 5.75

So, the result is 5.75.

3. Take the result (5.75) and add it to itself:

5.75 + 5.75 = 11.50

If we have two such eaten watermelons, the total weight of the parts eaten would be 2 x 37.1 = 74.2 kg.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Initially, there were 26 oranges. Then, 7.87 apples were added. To find the total number of pieces of fruit, I'll add the number of oranges and apples:

26 (oranges) + 7.87 (apples) = ?

First, I'll add the whole numbers: 26 + 7 = 33

Then, I'll add the decimal part: 0 (since there are no decimal oranges) + 0.87 = 0.87

I'll subtract the whole numbers: 63 - 28 = 35

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">The original problem asked for the sum of 55.1 and 8.7, which is 63.8. However, the new scenario introduces an apple, which is not part of the original problem.

The original problem only considered oranges, and the sum 55.1 + 8.7 = 63.8 is still valid. The addition of an apple does not affect the result of the original problem.

You have 82.52 left in your wallet, and you're going to spend the sum of 32.167. To find out how much you'll be left with, I'll subtract the sum from the initial amount:

82.52 - 32.167 = ?

First, I'll subtract the whole numbers: 82 - 32 = 50

Then, I'll subtract the decimal parts: 0.52 - 0.167 = 0.353
