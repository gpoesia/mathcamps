        In one month, a fireplace company sold 278 traditional wood-burning fireplaces. In the same month, they also sold 305 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones. How many gas fireplaces did the company sell?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of gas fireplaces sold is x. Since they sold 305 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones, we can set up the equation x = 305 + 278.

        Let's revisit our earlier scenario. Originally, the popular song had been played 84 times on Station A (not 54 as previously thought); it was still played 296 times on Station B, and 354 spins on Station C. Therefore, given the new count from Station A, what is the updated total number of spins that the song has received across Station A, Station B, and Station C?

        Suppose instead of 801 chocolate bars, the store initially had a smaller stock of 286 chocolate bars on one shelf, while the number of chocolate bars on the other shelf remained the same at 180. How many chocolate bars would then be in total on both shelves?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total number of chocolate bars, we need to add the number of chocolate bars on each shelf. We can do this by adding 286 and 180.

286 + 180 = ?

To add these numbers, we can start by adding the hundreds place: 200 + 180 = 380. Then, we add the remaining 86 to get 380 + 86 = 466.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's first find the total number of pirouettes she did before dinner. We know she did 212 pirouettes in the morning and 363 pirouettes after lunch, so the total number of pirouettes before dinner is 212 + 363 = 575. If she doubled this number, she would have done 575 x 2 = 1150 pirouettes. Since the total number of pirouettes she did for the day is 314 less than this, we can set up the equation:

575 + x = 1150 - 314

where x is the number of pirouettes she did after dinner. Solving for x, we get:

x = 1150 - 314 - 575
x = 261

So, the ballerina did 261 pirouettes after dinner.

        A furniture factory produces 90 single beds in a day. It produces 647 more double beds than single beds on the same day. How many double beds did the furniture factory produce?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of double beds produced is x. Since the factory produces 647 more double beds than single beds, we can set up the equation:

x = 90 + 647

To solve for x, we can add 90 to both sides of the equation:

x = 737

        Jack is a professional mountain climber. He has a rope that is 623 meters long. He buys an additional rope to make sure he is prepared for any situation. The total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. What is the total length of the two ropes?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the length of the additional rope be x meters.

The total length of both ropes is the length of the first rope (623 meters) plus the length of the additional rope (x meters). This can be represented by the equation:

623 + x = ?

The problem states that the total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope, so we can set up the equation:

623 + x = 623 + 377

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 377

So, the length of the additional rope is 377 meters.

The total length of both ropes is the sum of the lengths of the two ropes:

623 + 377 = ?

Adding the numbers, we get:

1000

        Considering that Jack is a professional mountain climber, he uses 623 meters of his rope on a massive mountain. He then buys an additional rope, ending up with a total length of 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, Jack has to use 675 meters of the combined length of rope in a rescue mission. How much length of rope does Jack have left now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, Jack has a rope of length 623 meters and buys an additional rope, making the total length of both ropes 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. We can represent this as:

Total length of both ropes = 623 + x
Total length of both ropes = 623 + 377 (since it's 377 meters more than the first rope)
Total length of both ropes = 1000

So, Jack has a total of 1000 meters of rope.

However, due to unforeseen circumstances, Jack has to use 675 meters of the combined length of rope in a rescue mission. To find out how much length of rope Jack has left, we need to subtract the amount used from the total length:

Length of rope left = Total length of both ropes - Amount used
= 1000 - 675
= 325

        Now, let's change the scenario a bit. Suppose originally, Jack had a shorter rope that was 472 meters long. Like before, he buys an additional rope, making the total length of both ropes 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. What is the total length of the two ropes in this situation?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's work through the problem again!

Let the length of the additional rope be x meters.

The total length of both ropes is the length of the first rope (472 meters) plus the length of the additional rope (x meters). This can be represented by the equation:

472 + x = ?

The problem states that the total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope, so we can set up the equation:

472 + x = 472 + 377

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 377

So, the length of the additional rope is 377 meters.

The total length of both ropes is the sum of the lengths of the two ropes:

472 + 377 = ?

Adding the numbers, we get:

849
