    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say Anne originally had x pairs of socks. After buying 15 new pairs, she now has a total of 20 pairs. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 15 = 20

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:

x = 5

So, Anne originally had 5 pairs of socks.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say Oliver originally had 'o' bones. If he gives 19 bones away, he would be left with o - 19 bones. According to the problem, he would be left with only 1 bone, so we can set up the equation o - 19 = 1.
To solve for o, we can add 19 to both sides of the equation: o - 19 + 19 = 1 + 19.
This simplifies to o = 20.

        The lifeguard started the day with a certain number of towels, but after handing some out, he only had 10 remaining. If he originally had 9 more than the remaining amount, how many towels did the lifeguard start with?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the number of towels the lifeguard started with is x.

Since he had 9 more towels than the remaining amount, we can set up the equation:

x = 9 + 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 9 from both sides:

x = 10 + 9
x = 19

So, the lifeguard started with 19 towels.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's find the difference between the original number of candy bars and the number of candy bars left. This difference will represent the number of candy bars taken.

Original number of candy bars = 14
Number of candy bars left = 10

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of stray cats she adopted is x. Since she had 7 cats initially and adopted x stray cats, the total number of cats she has now is 7 + x. We know that this total is equal to 20, so we can set up the equation:

7 + x = 20

To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

x = 20 - 7
x = 13

So, the crazy cat lady adopted 13 stray cats.

        A mountain climber starts at a point that is m feet high. After climbing downwards for a while, they reach a point that's 10 feet high. If they had climbed down 4 feet to reach this point, how high was the point where they started?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The mountain climber starts at a point that is m feet high.
2. They climb down to a point that is 10 feet high. This means they have descended m - 10 feet from the starting point.
3. At this point, they have climbed down 4 feet further to reach the 10 feet high point. This means they have descended an additional 4 feet from the previous point.
4. So, the total height they have descended from the starting point is m - 10 - 4 = m - 14 feet.
5. Since they have descended this height, the starting point must be 14 feet higher than the 10 feet high point. Therefore, the starting point is 10 + 14 = m feet high.

x = 6 + 4
x = 10

So, the speed of the river in the early morning was 10 km/hr.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of cans of beans distributed that day is x. We know that the number of cans of beans left at the end of the day is 13, which is the original number of cans minus the number of cans distributed. So, we can set up the equation:

17 - x = 13

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

17 = 13 + x

Subtracting 13 from both sides gives us:

4 = x

So, 4 cans of beans were distributed that day.

To solve for x, we can subtract 14 from both sides:

x = 16 - 14
x = 2

So, the fruit seller collected 2 oranges from his garden.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's find the number of binoculars the maker had in the morning. We know that by late afternoon, she had a total of 11 binoculars. To find the number of binoculars she made in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of binoculars she had in the morning from the total number of binoculars she had in the afternoon.

Number of binoculars made in the afternoon = Total number of binoculars - Number of binoculars in the morning

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of balls kids brought to the playground is x. Since there were originally 3 balls, the total number of balls at the end of the day is 3 + x. We know that the total number of balls at the end of the day is 8, so we can set up the equation:

3 + x = 8

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us:

x = 8 - 3
x = 5

So, kids brought 5 balls to the playground.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The pirate has 1 gold coin left with him, and he had stashed away 4 gold coins. To find the original number of gold coins, we need to add the number of gold coins he has left with him to the number of gold coins he has stashed away.

Let's say the pirate originally had x gold coins. He stashed away 4 gold coins, leaving him with x - 4 gold coins. Then, he took out 4 gold coins from the stash, leaving him with x - 4 - 4 = x - 8 gold coins. Since he has 1 gold coin left with him, we can set up the equation:

x - 8 = 1

To solve for x, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation:

x = 1 + 8
x = 9

So, the pirate originally had 9 gold coins before stashing them away.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of additional pencils the student put in the backpack is x.
The initial number of pencils in the backpack is 3.
The total number of pencils in the backpack after adding x pencils is 20.
We can set up an equation to represent this situation: 3 + x = 20
To solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 3
x = 17
So, the student put 17 additional pencils in the backpack.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of monkeys transferred is x. Initially, there were 6 monkeys in the enclosure. After the transfer, there are 7 monkeys. This means the number of monkeys transferred (x) plus the initial number of monkeys (6) equals the total number of monkeys (7).

We can set up an equation: x + 6 = 7

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides: x = 7 - 6
x = 1

So, 1 monkey was transferred.

        You have a music store with 18 guitars in stock. During the day, a customer comes and buys a number of guitars. By the end of the day, you count and find that you have 16 guitars left. How many guitars did the customer buy?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the customer bought x guitars. Initially, there were 18 guitars in stock. After the customer buys x guitars, there are 16 guitars left. This means that the number of guitars left is 18 - x. Since we know that the number of guitars left is 16, we can set up the equation:

18 - x = 16

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

18 = 16 + x

Subtracting 16 from both sides gives us:

2 = x

So, the customer bought 2 guitars.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of new mountain bikes shipped to the shop today is x. Since the shop had 4 mountain bikes initially and ended up with a total of 14, the number of mountain bikes they had at the end of the day is the sum of the initial number and the new shipments: 4 + x = 14.
To find the value of x, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: x = 14 - 4 = 10.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of blue colored pencils the classmate gave the child is x. The child initially had 2 blue colored pencils, and then they received x more. So, the total number of blue colored pencils the child has is 2 + x. We know that the child has 3 blue colored pencils in the end, so we can set up the equation:

2 + x = 3

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 3 - 2
x = 1

So, the classmate gave the child 1 blue colored pencil.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the total length of the rest of the pieces is x.

We know that the total length of the rope is 17 feet, and one of the pieces is 11 feet long. So, we can set up the equation:

11 + x = 17

To solve for x, we can subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:

x = 17 - 11
x = 6

So, the rest of the pieces together are 6 feet long.
