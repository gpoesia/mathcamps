        In a field, there are 25 bees on the roses and another 25 bees on the daisies. Meanwhile, in a nearby cluster of trees, there are 53 bees in total. After some time, the number of bees in the cluster of trees equals the number of bees in the field subtracted from the original number in the cluster. How many bees are left in the cluster of trees after some time?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's first find the total number of bees in the field. There are 25 bees on the roses and 25 bees on the daisies, so the total number of bees in the field is 25 + 25 = 50 bees.
The number of bees in the cluster of trees equals the original number in the cluster minus the number of bees in the field. So, we can set up the equation: 53 = x - 50, where x is the original number of bees in the cluster.
To solve for x, we can add 50 to both sides of the equation: x = 53 + 50 = 103.
This means that the original number of bees in the cluster was 103. After some time, the number of bees in the cluster equals the number of bees in the field subtracted from the original number in the cluster. So, the number of bees left in the cluster is 103 - 50 = 53.

        In the previous scenario, the pirate realized his treasure was 'g' paces away from the cove's entrance after the geologic changes. But, what if the geologic shift wasn't as dramatic and it only brought the cove's entrance 26 paces closer instead of 32 paces to his buried treasure? How many paces would the pirate now need to walk from the cove's entrance to reach his treasure?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, the pirate needs to walk 99 paces to reach the treasure. If the cove's entrance moved 26 paces closer, the distance between the entrance and the treasure is now 99 - 26 = 73 paces.

        In a video game, Jacob has 68 gems. He decided to give some of his gems away and was left with 62 gems. How many gems did he give away?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say Jacob gave away x gems. Since he had 68 gems initially and was left with 62 gems, the number of gems he gave away is the difference between the initial amount and the final amount. So, we can set up the equation:

68 - x = 62

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

68 = 62 + x

Subtracting 62 from both sides gives us:

6 = x

So, Jacob gave away 6 gems.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say Jacob gave away x gems. Since he had 100 gems initially and was left with 62 gems, the number of gems he gave away is the difference between the initial amount and the final amount. So, we can set up the equation:

100 - x = 62

To solve for x, we can subtract 62 from both sides of the equation:

100 - 62 = x

This simplifies to:

38 = x

So, Jacob gave away 38 gems.

        Following on from the previous scenario, let's say instead that Fiona began her practice session by practicing for 28 minutes and then decided to extend her practice time by an extra 20 minutes instead of 8. How many total minutes did Fiona practice piano that day in this scenario?

        An artisan has 75 beads for making bracelets. He uses 55 beads for a large commissioned piece, leaving a certain amount of beads. The artisan then receives another shipment with the equivalent number of beads as he currently has. How many beads does the artisan have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The artisan starts with 75 beads and uses 55 beads for the commissioned piece, leaving 75 - 55 = 20 beads.
He then receives another shipment with the same number of beads as he currently has, which is 20 beads.
So, the artisan now has 20 + 20 = 40 beads from the original shipment, plus the 20 beads he received in the new shipment, which is a total of 40 + 20 = 60 beads.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: There are 73 minutes past 12:00 noon, which means the minute hand is pointing at the 73rd minute mark.

        Continuing from the initial situation, suppose there are 73 minutes past 12:00 noon. But instead of subtracting 67 minutes from this as we did before, we subtract just 2 minutes. At what minute into the next hour will the minute hand on the clock be pointing now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: There are 73 minutes past 12:00 noon, which means the minute hand is pointing at the 73rd minute mark.
Subtracting 2 minutes from 73 minutes leaves 71 minutes, which means the minute hand will be pointing at the 71st minute mark of the same hour (12:71).
Since there is no 71st minute, we need to find the remainder when dividing 71 by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour). The remainder is 11, which means the minute hand will be pointing at the 11th minute mark of the next hour (1:11).

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

1 (driver) - 24 = -23

Since you can't have a negative number of people on the bus, we add 55 (the maximum capacity) to get:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The artist started with 88 tubes of paint and ended up with 69 tubes. To find out how many tubes he used, we need to subtract the number of tubes he has left from the original number of tubes.

88 (original number of tubes) - 69 (number of tubes left) = 19

The artist used 19 tubes of paint in this situation.

How many beach balls were originally in the storage unit before the party?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of beach balls originally in the storage unit is x.
After adding the played and newly received beach balls, the total number of beach balls fell short of 62, which means the total number of beach balls is 62 - 1 (since it fell short) = 61.
We know that the total number of beach balls is the sum of the played beach balls (21) and the newly received beach balls (21) and the beach balls in the storage unit (x): 21 + 21 + x = 61
Combine like terms: 42 + x = 61
Subtract 42 from both sides: x = 19
