        In a forest, there were originally 5840 trees. Over the course of a year, 1699 trees were cut down. How many trees remain in the forest now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The number of trees originally in the forest is 5840.
The number of trees cut down is 1699.
To find the number of trees remaining, subtract the number of trees cut down from the original number of trees: 5840 - 1699 = 5141.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The company starts with 4058 litres of red paint.
They use 3879 litres for a large project, leaving them with:

        After they used some paint for a large project, the company realized they actually used less paint than they originally thought. They only used 1779 litres of red paint instead of the previously thought 4058 litres. How many litres of red paint does the company now realize they have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The company initially thought they used 3879 litres, but they actually used 1779 litres.
To find the correct amount of paint used, subtract the actual amount from the initial amount:
4058 - 1779 = &lt;&lt;4058-1779=2280&gt;&gt;2280 litres of red paint used.
Since they used 1779 litres, they have:
4058 - 1779 = &lt;&lt;4058-1779=2280&gt;&gt;2280 litres of red paint left.

They distributed 7730 doors to various stores.
To find out how many doors they have left, we subtract the number of doors distributed from the total number of doors made: 8110 - 7730 = &lt;&lt;8110-7730=380&gt;&gt;380.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The first pirate initially had an unknown number of gold coins, which we'll call x.
After giving the second pirate 4496 coins, the first pirate is left with x - 4496 gold coins.
We know that the first pirate was left with 3979 gold coins after giving the second pirate his share.
So, we can set up the equation: x - 4496 = 3979.
To solve for x, we add 4496 to both sides of the equation: x = 3979 + 4496.
x = 8475.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The pizza place initially had 5292 boxes of pizza.
They received a new delivery of 197 boxes, so we add 5292 + 197 = &lt;&lt;5292+197=5489&gt;&gt;5489 boxes of pizza.

As a continuation, suppose that after Roberta's check, she spent 4087 additional seconds completing a task. Combining the time she spent on the task and the time that had passed since she checked, how many seconds total had passed since she first checked the clock?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The clock showed 4407 seconds when Roberta checked it. Since then, she spent 4087 additional seconds completing a task.
The total time that has passed since Roberta checked the clock is the time that had passed since she checked the clock (852 seconds) plus the time she spent on the task (4087 seconds). So, the total time that has passed is 852 + 4087 = 4939 seconds.

    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The company started with 9752 shirts and ended with 9475 shirts. To find the number of shirts sold, we subtract the number of shirts left from the initial number of shirts: 9752 - 9475 = -23.
However, this is not possible since the company cannot have a negative number of shirts. This means that there must be an error in the given information. Let's re-examine the problem: 9752 shirts were shipped out initially, and 9475 shirts were left at the end of the month. This means that the company must have received some shirts during the month, not just shipped them out. Let's call the number of shirts received x. Then, the number of shirts sold is the difference between the initial number of shirts and the number of shirts left, minus the number of shirts received: 9752 - 9475 + x = x.
Since the company cannot have a negative number of shirts, x must be positive. This means that the company received some shirts during the month, and the number of shirts sold is the difference between the initial number of shirts and the number of shirts left, minus the number of shirts received.

        Continuing from the original scenario, let's say the astronaut initially only spent 2630 hours of training before travelling to space, but still spent the same amount of time, 1713 hours, on exercises and tasks once in space. How many total hours has the astronaut spent between training and space tasks with this revised training time?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The astronaut spent 2630 hours on training before going to space.
He spent an additional 1713 hours on tasks once in space.
To find the total hours, we add the hours spent on training and tasks: 2630 + 1713 = &lt;&lt;2630+1713=4343&gt;&gt;.

In the second batch, it produced 2207 more bananas, so the total number of bananas produced in the second batch is 3811 + 2207 = 6018.
The total number of bananas produced is the sum of the bananas produced in both batches, which is 3811 + 6018 = 9839.

        Suppose that the count of elephants in the sanctuary initially was not 8483 but 6404. So in this case, if they still rescued 118 more, how many elephants would the sanctuary have in total then?
    </p>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The sanctuary initially had 6404 elephants.
After rescuing 118 more elephants, the total number of elephants is 6404 + 118 = 6522.

        A farmer had a successful year and harvested 5580 kg of potatoes. Unfortunately, 588 kg of these potatoes were of a low quality and couldn't be sold. How many kilograms of potatoes does the farmer have that are of good quality and can be sold?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The farmer harvested 5580 kg of potatoes initially. 588 kg of these potatoes are of low quality and cannot be sold. To find the number of potatoes that are of good quality and can be sold, we subtract the number of low-quality potatoes from the total number of potatoes harvested.

5580 kg - 588 kg = 4992 kg

        Let's consider the previous problem, where a farmer had a successful year and harvested 5580 kg of potatoes, with 588 kg being of low quality and couldn't be sold. 

But what if the original harvest was not as bountiful as we first thought, and the farmer only harvested 5080 kg instead of 5580 kg. In this case, keeping the same 588 kg of low quality that couldn't be sold, how many kg of good quality potatoes would the farmer have?

5080 kg - 588 kg = 4492 kg

        A child has 9007 grains of sand in his sandbox. He then removes 2233 grains of sand. How many grains of sand are left in his sandbox?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The child initially has 9007 grains of sand.
He removes 2233 grains of sand, so we subtract 2233 from 9007 to find the remaining grains of sand.
9007 - 2233 = 6774
