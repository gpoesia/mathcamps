        In the previous problem, the juice company produced 73528 liters of juice filled into 707 containers. Now consider instead that the juice company produced a new batch of fresh juice, a total of 2858 liters. If the new batch was also filled the same way into 707 containers, how many liters of juice are now in each container?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find the total amount of juice produced by the company, which is the sum of the initial batch and the new batch.

Total juice = Initial batch + New batch
= 73528 + 2858
= 76386 liters

Since the new batch is also filled into 707 containers, we can divide the total amount of juice by the number of containers to find the number of liters in each container.

76386 ÷ 707 = 108

So, there are 108 liters of juice in each container.

        A star emits 51750 units of light energy every 125 seconds. How much light energy does the star emit every second?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the amount of light energy emitted per second, we need to divide the total light energy emitted (51750 units) by the time it takes to emit that amount of energy (125 seconds).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say x yards of fabric are used to produce each blanket. Since the company can make 18 blankets from 19944 yards of fabric, we can set up the equation:

18x = 19944

        The farmer has now harvested a bigger lot of 7798 bushels of apples and once again distributes them equally into 5 bins. Now, how many bushels of apples does each bin contain?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of bushels of apples in each bin, we need to divide the total number of bushels (7798) by the number of bins (5).

7798 ÷ 5 = 1559.6

Since we can't have a fraction of a bushel, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

1559.6 ≈ 1559

So, each bin contains 1559 bushels of apples.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many times you can brush your teeth with this tube of toothpaste, we need to divide the total amount of toothpaste (9060 grams) by the amount used per brushing (306 grams).

9060 ÷ 306 = 29.58 (approximately)

Since you can't brush your teeth a fraction of a time, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

        Instead of 3318 Earth days, consider that the alien civilization uses a different form of time measurement, where each of their &quot;days&quot; represents 8212 of our Earth days. In this scenario, if they were still sending 43134 messages throughout this period, how many messages would they be sending per their &quot;day&quot;?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to convert the total number of Earth days to the alien civilization's &quot;days&quot;. Since each of their &quot;days&quot; represents 8212 Earth days, we can divide the total number of Earth days by 8212:

3318 Earth days ÷ 8212 = 0.404 (approximately)

So, the period of time is equivalent to approximately 0.404 of their &quot;days&quot;.

Now, we can divide the total number of messages by the number of their &quot;days&quot; to find the number of messages sent per their &quot;day&quot;:

43134 messages ÷ 0.404 = 106750 (approximately)

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

        A map has a scale of 91368 centimeters representing 216 kilometers. How many centimeters on the map represent 1 kilometer in real life?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's set up a proportion to relate the map distance to the real-life distance. We know that 91,368 centimeters on the map represents 216 kilometers in real life. We can set up the proportion as follows:

91,368 cm / 216 km = x cm / 1 km

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

91,368 = 216x

Now, divide both sides by 216:

x = 91,368 ÷ 216

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of square inches of glass required for a single window is x.

Since the manufacturer's current stock can cover 2118 same-sized windows, the total square inches of glass in the stock is 2118x.

We know that this stock can cover 6354 square inches of glass material, so we can set up the equation:

2118x = 6354

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2118:

x = 6354 ÷ 2118
x = 3

So, a single window requires 3 square inches of glass material.

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6122:

x = 6354 ÷ 6122
x = 1.04

So, each of the new model windows now requires approximately 1.04 square inches of glass material.

        A very active mouse runs 14824 meters in 4 hours. If he runs at a constant rate, how many meters per hour does he run?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the rate at which the mouse runs, we need to divide the total distance traveled (14824 meters) by the time it took to travel that distance (4 hours).

Rate = Total Distance ÷ Time
= 14824 meters ÷ 4 hours
= 3706 meters per hour

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many bananas each monkey will get, we need to divide the total number of bananas (88,508) by the number of monkeys (406).
