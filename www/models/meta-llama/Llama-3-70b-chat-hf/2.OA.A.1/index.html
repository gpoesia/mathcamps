        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's subtract the number of roller skates for children from the total number of roller skates to find the number of roller skates for adults.

Number of roller skates for adults = Total number of roller skates - Number of roller skates for children

        A town has 98 dogs in total. Some dogs relocated to another town, leaving 73 dogs. How many dogs relocated from the town?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's find the difference between the initial number of dogs and the number of dogs left after some relocated.

Initial number of dogs = 98
Number of dogs left = 73

To find the number of dogs that relocated, subtract the number of dogs left from the initial number of dogs:

Number of dogs that relocated = Initial number of dogs - Number of dogs left
= 98 - 73
= 25

        Captain Bruce's pirate ship weighs 78 tons with all the crew members and cargo. However, once they remove the cargo which weighs 74 tons, the weight of the ship with just the crew is needed. What is the weight of the pirate ship with just the crew (in tons)?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's first find the weight of the ship without the cargo. The total weight is 78 tons, and the cargo weighs 74 tons, so the weight of the ship without the cargo is 78 - 74 = 4 tons. This 4 tons includes the weight of the crew, so to find the weight of the ship with just the crew, we need to subtract the weight of the crew from 4 tons. However, we don't know the weight of the crew, so let's call it x. Then, the weight of the ship is 4 - x. But we know that the weight of the ship with the crew is 4 tons, so 4 - x = 4, which means x = 0. This doesn't make sense, because the crew must have some weight. The problem is that we assumed the weight of the ship without the cargo is 4 tons, but this includes the weight of the crew. So, let's try again. The total weight is 78 tons, and the cargo weighs 74 tons, so the weight of the ship with the crew is 78 - 74 = 4 tons. This means the weight of the ship is 4 tons minus the weight of the crew. Let's call the weight of the ship x. Then, x + (weight of the crew) = 4. We know that x + (weight of the crew) = 78 - 74, so x + (weight of the crew) = 4, and x + (weight of the crew) = 78 - 74. This means x = 4, and the weight of the crew is 4 - x = 4 - 4 = 0, which again doesn't make sense. The problem is that we are trying to find two unknowns (the weight of the ship and the weight of the crew) with one equation. We need another equation. Let's call the weight of the ship x and the weight of the crew y. Then, x + y = 4 (because the weight of the ship with the crew is 4 tons), and x + y + 74 = 78 (because the total weight is 78 tons). We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get 74 = 74, which is true but doesn't help us. We can also subtract the second equation from the first equation to get -74 = -74, which again is true but doesn't help us. We can try to add the equations, but this doesn't help either. We can try to multiply the equations, but this doesn't help either. The problem is that we have two equations with two unknowns, but the equations are not independent (one equation is a multiple of the other). This means we cannot find the weight of the ship with just the crew.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say Sam added x strings to his collection. We know that he initially had 22 strings and ended up with 41 strings. We can set up an equation to represent this situation: 22 + x = 41.

To solve for x, we can subtract 22 from both sides of the equation: x = 41 - 22.

x = 19

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step!

We know that John spends 7 hours working on the puzzle initially. Then, he takes an additional amount of time 'b' to finish the puzzle completely. The total time he spends working on the puzzle is 13 hours.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

7 (initial hours) + b (additional hours) = 13 (total hours)

To find the value of 'b', we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

b = 13 - 7
b = 6

So, John spends 6 additional hours to finish the puzzle.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of degrees the compass rotated, we need to subtract the initial bearing from the final bearing.

Therefore, we can simply subtract the initial bearing from the final bearing.

74 - 48 = 26

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's analyze the situation: the bear has already eaten 89 pounds of food, and it needs to reach a total of 92 pounds. To find out how much more food the bear needs to eat, we can subtract the amount it has already eaten from its goal.

Let t be the amount of food the bear still needs to eat. We can set up the equation:

89 + t = 92

To solve for t, we can subtract 89 from both sides of the equation:

t = 92 - 89
t = 3

So, the bear needs to eat 3 more pounds of food to reach its goal.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of jackets sold is x. Since the store had 25 jackets initially and 11 are left, we can set up the equation: 25 - x = 11.

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation: 25 - x + x = 11 + x, which simplifies to 25 = 11 + x.

Subtracting 11 from both sides gives us: 25 - 11 = x, which simplifies to 14 = x.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the number of romantic songs is x.

We know that if we subtract the number of romantic songs from the total, we have 20 songs left, so we can set up the equation:

40 - x = 20

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

40 = 20 + x

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:

20 = x

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the original number of sleeping bags in the shop is 'a'.

After selling 36 sleeping bags, the shop is left with 35 sleeping bags. This means that the number of sleeping bags sold (36) is equal to the difference between the original number of sleeping bags (a) and the number of sleeping bags left (35).

We can set up an equation:

a - 36 = 35

To solve for 'a', we can add 36 to both sides of the equation:

a = 35 + 36
a = 71

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say there were x apples on the farm originally.

We know that 21 apples fell from the trees, so the number of apples left is x - 21.

We are also told that there are 49 apples left, so we can set up the equation:

x - 21 = 49

To solve for x, we can add 21 to both sides of the equation:

x = 49 + 21
x = 70

So, there were 70 apples on the farm originally.

        A teacher initially had 'a' sheets of special star stickers in her drawer. She then used 60 stickers for rewarding her students in class, and now she has only 2 sheets left. How many sheets of star stickers did the teacher initially have in her drawer?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the initial number of sheets of star stickers be 'a'.

We know that the teacher used 60 stickers and now she has only 2 sheets left. Since each sheet contains some number of stickers (let's call it 'x'), we can set up the equation:

a - 60/x = 2

We need to find the value of 'a'. To do this, we need to know the number of stickers in each sheet (x). Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide this information. However, we can make an educated guess based on the context. Typically, a sheet of stickers contains a dozen or a multiple of a dozen stickers. Let's assume each sheet contains 12 stickers (x = 12).

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

a - 60/12 = 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

a - 5 = 2

Adding 5 to both sides, we get:

a = 7

So, the teacher initially had 7 sheets of star stickers in her drawer.

When he sells 39 cows, he is left with x - 39 cows.

        The zoo started the day with some number of animals, which we'll call s. During the day, 24 animals were moved to a separate area of the zoo for cleaning and care. After this, there were still 75 animals visible to visitors in the main section of the zoo. How many animals were there in total at the zoo at the start of the day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's start by using the information that after 24 animals were moved, there were 75 animals visible to visitors in the main section of the zoo. This means that the number of animals in the main section before the 24 animals were moved is 75 + 24 = 99.

Since this is the main section, it's the original number of animals minus the 24 that were moved. So, we can set up the equation:

s - 24 = 99

To solve for s, we can add 24 to both sides of the equation:

s = 99 + 24
s = 123

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say x animals were transferred to the other zoo. Since there are 18 animals left, we can set up the equation:

99 - x = 18

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

99 = 18 + x

Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us:

81 = x

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the initial number of strawberries is j.

We know that after eating 43 strawberries, Natalia is left with 13 strawberries. This means that the number of strawberries eaten (43) is the difference between the initial number of strawberries (j) and the number of strawberries left (13).

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

j - 43 = 13

To solve for j, we can add 43 to both sides of the equation:

j = 13 + 43
j = 56

After donating 9 bars to a local charity, there are now 81 bars of soap left. This means that the number of bars of soap left is equal to the initial number of bars minus 9.

We can set up an equation: f - 9 = 81

To solve for f, we can add 9 to both sides of the equation: f = 81 + 9
f = 90

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of oranges the farmer got from his other tree is x. We know that the total number of oranges is 72, and 57 of those came from one tree. So, we can set up the equation: x + 57 = 72.

To solve for x, we can subtract 57 from both sides of the equation: x = 72 - 57 = 15.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of bananas the farmer sold is x. Since the farmer is left with 15 bananas, we can set up the equation:

41 - x = 15

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

41 = 15 + x

Subtracting 15 from both sides gives us:

26 = x

So, the farmer sold 26 bananas.
