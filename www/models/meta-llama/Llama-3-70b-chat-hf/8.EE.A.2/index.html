        A child builds a sandcastle in a sandbox. The sandbox has the shape of a cubic box with 512 cubic feet of sand. What is the length of each side of the sandbox in feet?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Since the sandbox is a cubic box, all sides have the same length. Let's call this length &quot;s&quot;. The volume of the sandbox is given as 512 cubic feet, which is equal to the product of the length, width, and height of the box. Since it's a cube, the length, width, and height are all equal to &quot;s&quot;. So, we can set up the equation:

s × s × s = 512

This is a cubic equation, and we can solve for &quot;s&quot; by taking the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛512

s = 8

So, the length of each side of the sandbox is 8 feet.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Since each cubic centimeter of the flower holds 1 milliliter of nectar, and the flower holds 125 milliliters of nectar, we can set up the following equation:

Volume of the cube (in cubic centimeters) = 125

Since the flower grows in the shape of a cube, the volume of the cube is given by:

Volume = side^3

where &quot;side&quot; is the length of one side of the cube.

Equating the two expressions, we get:

side^3 = 125

To find the length of one side, we take the cube root of both sides:

side = ∛125
side = 5

We know the volume is 216 cubic cm, so we can set up the equation:

s³ = 216

To find the value of s, we take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛216

s = 6

        The number 27 appears in a dream of a person who loves cryptic letters. He knows this number corresponds to a number obtained by cubing a letter's position in the alphabet. Can you find that letter by its position? (Let's use 'a' as 1, 'b' as 2, and so on.)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's think about it! If the number 27 corresponds to a letter's position in the alphabet cubed, that means we need to find a number that, when cubed, gives us 27.

Let's try to find the cube root of 27:

³√27 = 3

So, the number that, when cubed, gives us 27 is 3. Now, we need to find the letter that corresponds to the position 3 in the alphabet.

Using the standard ordering of the alphabet, we get:

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's call the length of the object &quot;x&quot;. Since the temperature is directly proportional to the cube of its length, we can write an equation:

Temperature = k × x³

where k is the proportionality constant.

We are given that the temperature is 729 degrees, so we can plug this value into the equation:

729 = k × x³

To solve for x, we can start by noticing that 729 is a perfect cube: 729 = 9³. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

9³ = k × x³

Now, we can equate the cubes:

9 = x

So, the length of the object is 9 units.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the package is a cube, all its edges are equal. Let's call the length of each edge &quot;s&quot;. The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s³. We know the volume is 512 cubic centimeters, so we can set up the equation:

s³ = 512

To find the value of s, we take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛512
s = 8

So, each edge of the candy package is 8 centimeters long.

        A backpack has a cubical shape and can hold a volume of 216 cubic inches. What is the length of each side of the backpack in inches?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Since the backpack has a cubical shape, all sides are equal. Let's call the length of each side &quot;s&quot;. The volume of a cube is given by the formula:

Volume = s × s × s = s³

We know the volume of the backpack is 216 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

s³ = 216

To find the value of s, we take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛216
s = 6

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the volume of the cube is 729 cubic units, we can find the length of each side by taking the cube root of the volume.

Let's denote the length of each side as x. Then, the volume of the cube is x³ = 729.

To find x, we take the cube root of both sides:

x = ∛729
x = 9

        A cookie dough is kneaded into a cube shape before baking. If the dough has a volume of 512 cubic cm, what is the length of each side of the cube in cm?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the cookie dough is in the shape of a cube, all sides have the same length. Let's call the length of each side &quot;s&quot;. The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s³, where V is the volume and s is the length of each side.

We are given that the volume of the cookie dough is 512 cubic cm, so we can set up the equation:

512 = s³

To find the length of each side, we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:

s = ∛512
s = 8

        A tree has a cubical hole in its trunk. The volume of the cubical hole is 8 cubic feet. What is the length of the edge of this cubic hole in feet?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of the edge of the cube. We are given that the volume of the cubical hole is 8 cubic feet, so we can set up the equation:

s^3 = 8

To find the length of the edge, we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:

s = ∛8
s = 2

        A guitarist uses a particular type of guitar string. The thickness of the string, in hundreds of a millimeter, cubed, will determine the pitch of a certain note, the guitarist wishes to play. If he needs the pitch to equal 343 Hz, what is the thickness of the string he should choose?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's call the thickness of the string &quot;x&quot; in hundreds of a millimeter. Since the pitch is determined by the cube of the thickness, we can set up the equation:

x^3 = 343

To solve for x, we take the cube root of both sides:

x = ∛343

x = 7

So, the thickness of the string the guitarist should choose is 7 hundredths of a millimeter.

### Answer: 7 hundredths of a millimeter.</pre>

        The cubic area of the compass box is 729 cubic cm. What is the length of one edge of this cubical compass box, given that it is a cube?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the compass box is a cube, all its edges are equal. Let's call the length of one edge &quot;x&quot;. Then, the volume of the cube is x × x × x = x³. We are given that the volume is 729 cubic cm, so we can set up the equation:

x³ = 729

To find the value of x, we take the cube root of both sides:

x = ∛729
x = 9

        A book is written with a unique style where every page is in the shape of a cube. If the volume of one page is 64 cubic inches, what is the side length of each page?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Since the page is in the shape of a cube, all its sides are equal. Let's call the side length &quot;s&quot;. The volume of a cube is given by the formula:

Volume = s × s × s = s³

We know the volume of one page is 64 cubic inches, so we can set up the equation:

s³ = 64

To find the side length, we take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛64
s = 4

### Answer: 4 inches</pre>
