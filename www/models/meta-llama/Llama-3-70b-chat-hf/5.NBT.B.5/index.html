The dragon also has scales on its tail, which is the same amount as one side, so it has 904 scales on its tail. In total, the dragon has 1808 + 904 = 2712 scales on both sides and its tail. Since the dragon has a total of 5 parts (2 sides, tail, and 2 other parts), and each part has the same amount of scales, the total number of scales is 5 x 904 = 4520.

        A snail travels at a speed of 1681 millimeters per hour. If it continues moving for 37 hours, how many millimeters will it travel?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of sets of tires sold, we can divide the total number of tires by 21.

Since each set has 21 tires, we multiply the number of sets by 21 to find the total number of tires sold. 
189 × 21 = 3979. 
However, this is not possible since the bike shop only had 3978 tires. This means that the bike shop sold 189 sets of tires, which is a total of 189 × 21 = 3969 tires.
