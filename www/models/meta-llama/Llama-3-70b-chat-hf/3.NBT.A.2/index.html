    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The store initially had 130 computers in stock. They received a new shipment of 643 computers, so we need to add the new shipment to the initial stock.

To find the total number of computers, we add the initial stock and the new shipment: 130 + 643 = 773.

        Reconsidering the first sale at the sports store, let's say that instead of initially having 808 skateboards they actually had only 365 skateboards. If they still sold 337 skateboards during the big summer sale, how many skateboards would have been left in the store?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of skateboards left, we need to subtract the number of skateboards sold from the original number of skateboards.

Let's subtract 337 from 365:

365 - 337 = -28 (wait, this can't be right! You can't have a negative number of skateboards!)

This means that the store didn't have enough skateboards to sell 337. They would have run out of skateboards before selling 337.

Let's rethink this: if they sold 337 skateboards, but they only had 365, that means they sold 365 skateboards (since they can't sell more than they have). To find out how many skateboards are left, we subtract 365 from 365:

365 - 365 = 0

So, there would be 0 skateboards left in the store.

        Following on from the previous question: Now, there are 547 clouds in the sky. Then, a gust of wind blew in and added an additional 90 clouds. But after a while, due to the hot sun, 435 of those clouds evaporated. How many clouds are there in the sky now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's break this down step by step:

Initial number of clouds = 547
Number of clouds added by the gust of wind = 90
Total number of clouds after the gust of wind = Initial number of clouds + Number of clouds added
= 547 + 90
= 637

Now, 435 clouds evaporate due to the hot sun. To find the number of clouds remaining, we subtract the number of clouds that evaporated from the total number of clouds:

Number of clouds remaining = Total number of clouds - Number of clouds evaporated
= 637 - 435

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the total number of mice before the shipment.

Number of white mice = 312
Number of brown mice = 403

Total number of mice before shipment = Number of white mice + Number of brown mice

Then, the pet store received a shipment of 268 more brown mice. So, the new total number of brown mice is:

New total number of brown mice = Old total number of brown mice + Number of brown mice in shipment
= 403 + 268
= 671

Now, we can find the total number of mice:

Total number of mice now = Number of white mice + New total number of brown mice

Total number of clowns on the first day = 120 + 350 = 470

Then, 361 clowns had to leave due to other commitments. To find the number of clowns left, we subtract the number of clowns who left from the total number of clowns on the first day.

Number of clowns left = Total number of clowns on the first day - Number of clowns who left

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that 98 tables remained from the initial production. The factory then produced an additional 329 tables. To find the total number of tables produced that month, we need to add the initial production to the additional production.

        In the previous scenario, suppose that the furniture factory had initially produced 824 tables instead of 642. After discarding the same number of faulty tables (544), how many tables would have remained from that month's production?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The factory produced 824 tables, but 544 of them were discarded due to quality issues. To find the number of tables that remained, we need to subtract the number of discarded tables from the total number of tables produced.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the initial number of colored pencils to the number of colored pencils added to the stock.

Initial number of colored pencils = 91

Total number of colored pencils = 91 + 738

To find the total number of colored pencils, we add 91 and 738.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that there are 829 colored pencils in the art class. Now, we need to add the additional 67 colored pencils to the existing stock.

Total number of colored pencils before the donation = 829
Number of colored pencils donated = 67
Total number of colored pencils after the donation = 829 + 67

To find the total number of colored pencils, we add 829 and 67.

But what if we made a counting error and there were actually only 457 monkeys to start with? Considering the same decrease by 454 monkeys, how many monkeys would be left in the jungle in this case?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's recalculate the number of monkeys left in the jungle, assuming the initial population was 457 monkeys.

Initial population = 457
Reduction in population = 454

Number of monkeys left = Initial population - Reduction in population
= 457 - 454
= 3

However, since we can't have a negative number of monkeys, and 457 - 454 is very close to 0, we can conclude that there would be no monkeys left in the jungle. In other words, the monkey population would be extinct.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the total number of precious stones Captain Scallywag had initially.

Number of sapphires = 206
Number of emeralds = 312

Total number of precious stones initially = Number of sapphires + Number of emeralds

Then, Captain Scallywag loses 506 precious stones to the sea. To find the number of precious stones left, we subtract the number of stones lost from the total number of stones initially.

Number of precious stones left = Total number of precious stones initially - Number of stones lost
= 518 - 506

        Let's reconsider the scenario in the fruit market. What if initially there were 354 green grapes instead of 140 in one stall while the number of red grapes remained the same at 377 in another stall? How many grapes would there be in total then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total number of grapes, we need to add the number of green grapes and the number of red grapes.

Number of green grapes = 354
Number of red grapes = 377

Total number of grapes = Number of green grapes + Number of red grapes
= 354 + 377

        Considering the 182 children who play on the jungle gym every morning and the additional 223 children who come in the afternoon, we can see it's popular. What's more, an adjacent playground attracts 490 more children daily. So, how many children in total enjoy these facilities each day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that the jungle gym attracts a total of 182 + 223 = 405 children each day.

The adjacent playground attracts 490 more children daily.

To find the total number of children enjoying these facilities each day, we need to add the number of children at the jungle gym to the number of children at the adjacent playground.

Total number of children = 405 + 490 = 895

        After building the castle, Jack found an old box in his closet, which contained additional 715 building blocks. How many total building blocks does he have now?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Jack already had 23 blocks left after building the castle. Now, he found an additional 715 blocks. To find the total number of blocks he has now, we need to add the number of blocks he already had to the new blocks he found.

Let's add 23 and 715:

23 + 715 = 738

        Jack remembered incorrectly initially. He actually had 438 building blocks, not 391, before building his castle. Given this, how many building blocks does he have left after building the castle?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many blocks Jack has left, we need to subtract the number of blocks he used from the total number of blocks he had.

Let's subtract 368 from 438:

438 - 368 = 70

The baby also needs to consume 67 milliliters of water daily. To find the total liquid consumption, we add the amount of milk and water:
