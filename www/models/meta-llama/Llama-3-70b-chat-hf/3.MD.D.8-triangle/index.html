    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the triangle is equilateral, all three sides are equal. Let's call the length of each side &quot;x&quot;. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, which is 990cm. We can set up the equation: x + x + x = 990.

Combine like terms: 3x = 990.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 990/3.

x = 330.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's call the length of the third side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, so we can set up the equation:

2 + 667 + x = 997

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 and 667 from both sides of the equation:

x = 997 - 2 - 667
x = 328

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since it's an equilateral triangle, all three sides are equal. Let's call the length of each side &quot;x&quot;. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + x = 591

Combine like terms:

3x = 591

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 591/3
x = 197

So, the length of each side of the triangle is 197 cm.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the triangle is equilateral, all three sides are equal. Let's call the length of each side &quot;x&quot;. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, which is 657 meters. We can set up the equation: x + x + x = 657.

Combine like terms: 3x = 657.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 657/3.

x = 219.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the triangle is equilateral, all three sides are equal. Let's call the length of each side &quot;x&quot;. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, which is 114cm. We can set up the equation: x + x + x = 114.

Combine like terms: 3x = 114.

Divide both sides by 3: x = 114/3.

x = 38.

        A triangle has sides of lengths 464m and 377m respectively. If the total perimeter of the triangle is 907m, what is the length of the third side?

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's call the length of the third side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. So, we can set up the equation:

464 + 377 + x = 907

Combine the constants on the left-hand side:

841 + x = 907

Subtract 841 from both sides:

x = 907 - 841
x = 66
