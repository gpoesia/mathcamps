One day, she decided to detour and added an extra 32/24 miles to her regular bike route. How many miles in total did she travel after adding the extra traveling distance?

        Tom moved two rocks today. The first rock was moved for an interval of 20/50 hours, and the second was moved for an interval of 45/36 hours. If Tom can move rocks at a speed of 25/22 miles per hour, how far in miles did he move the rocks today?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The first rock was moved for an interval of 20/50 = &lt;&lt;20/50=0.4&gt;&gt;0.4 hours, and the second was moved for an interval of 45/36 = &lt;&lt;45/36=1.25&gt;&gt;1.25 hours.
Tom can move rocks at a speed of 25/22 = &lt;&lt;25/22=1.14&gt;&gt;1.14 miles per hour.
Tom moved the first rock for 0.4 hours at a speed of 1.14 miles per hour, so he moved the first rock 0.4 × 1.14 = &lt;&lt;0.4*1.14=0.456&gt;&gt;0.456 miles.
Tom moved the second rock for 1.25 hours at a speed of 1.14 miles per hour, so he moved the second rock 1.25 × 1.14 = &lt;&lt;1.25*1.14=1.425&gt;&gt;1.425 miles.
Tom moved the rocks a total of 0.456 + 1.425 = &lt;&lt;0.456+1.425=1.881&gt;&gt;1.881 miles.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The scientist mixes 10/42 + 32 = &lt;&lt;10/42+32=32+10/42=32+5/21=37/21&gt;&gt;37/21 liters of solution. She then removes 4/28 of this mixture, which is 4/28 * 37/21 = &lt;&lt;4/28*37/21=4/28*37/21=4*37/(28*21)=4*37/(28*3*7)=4*37/(84*7)=4*1/(84)=1/210&gt;&gt;1/210 of the mixture. The remaining mixture is therefore 37/21 - 1/210 = &lt;&lt;37/21-1/210=37/21-1/210=37*210/(21*210)-1/210=37*210-1/(21*210)=37*210-1/420=37*210-1/(2*210)=37*210-1/210=37*209/210=37*13/15=481/15&gt;&gt;481/15 liters. The scientist then extracts 11/29 of this remaining mixture, which is 11/29 * 481/15 = &lt;&lt;11/29*481/15=11/29*481/15=11*481/(29*15)=11*481/(29*3*5)=11*481/(145*5)=11*481/(725)=11*32/25=352/25&gt;&gt;352/25 liters.

The amount of juice left in the bottle is 4091/1435-11/19 = &lt;&lt;(4091/1435)-(11/19)=(4091*19-11*1435)/(1435*19)=78429-15795/27145=62634/27145&gt;&gt;62634/27145 gallon.

        A farmer harvests honey and sells it in kilograms. In a day, the farmer on average harvests 44/10 kilograms from each beehive. If there are 37 beehives, how many kilograms honey does he harvest in a day? If he sells 3/37 of the total honey harvested in a day, how many kilograms of honey does he sell?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The farmer harvests 44/10 × 37 = &lt;&lt;44/10*37=176/10=17.6&gt;&gt;17.6 kilograms of honey in a day.
The farmer sells 3/37 × 176/10 = &lt;&lt;3/37*176/10=48/10=4.8&gt;&gt;4.8 kilograms of honey in a day.
