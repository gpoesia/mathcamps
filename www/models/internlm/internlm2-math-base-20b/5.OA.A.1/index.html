        A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 2840/40 = &lt;&lt;2840/40=71&gt;&gt;71 packs of socks will be made. 71+93 = &lt;&lt;71+93=164&gt;&gt;164 packs of socks will be made in total.
Reasoning: 70-8 = &lt;&lt;70-8=62&gt;&gt;62 packs of socks were received. 164+62 = &lt;&lt;164+62=226&gt;&gt;226 packs of socks are now available.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The toy car's battery lasts 16 hours. However, if the car's lights are used, the battery life decreases by the equivalent of 36/9 = &lt;&lt;36/9=4&gt;&gt;4 hours. Therefore, the battery lasts 16-4 = &lt;&lt;16-4=12&gt;&gt;12 hours with the lights on. The toy car is run with the lights on for 12 full weeks, each week considered to be 60 hours. Therefore, the toy car is run with the lights on for 12*60 = &lt;&lt;12*60=720&gt;&gt;720 hours. The battery lasts 720/12 = &lt;&lt;720/12=60&gt;&gt;60 weeks. Therefore, the battery lasted 60 weeks.

        A farmer starts the day with 18 tomatoes in his basket. By midday, he manages to harvest some more, bringing the total to 18 + 82 tomatoes in the basket. Unfortunately, 37 of these tomatoes are deemed unsellable because they are not ripe enough. How many tomatoes does the farmer have left in the basket that are ready to sell?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The farmer has 18+82 = &lt;&lt;18+82=100&gt;&gt;100 tomatoes in the basket.
37 of these are not ripe enough, so the farmer has 100-37 = &lt;&lt;100-37=63&gt;&gt;63 tomatoes left in the basket that are ready to sell.
