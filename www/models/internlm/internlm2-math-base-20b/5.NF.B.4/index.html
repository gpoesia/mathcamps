        Mary has a garden with apple trees. Each tree produces 3 bushels of apples, and she has 6 trees in total. However, due to pests, only half of her trees produce apples this year. How many bushels of apples does Mary harvest from her garden this year?

        In the previous scenario, we calculated the product of the fraction 18/12 and the whole number 11. 

Now, consider what would happen if instead of multiplying by 11, we multiplied by 10. What would be the product of 18/12 and 10? Please write your answer as a simplified fraction or whole number as appropriate.

He found a new vineyard that produces a type of grape juice that is 15/6 more concentrated than the one he originally uses.

        Now, let's say that Michael tasted the juice made with the adjusted recipe and found it too concentrated for his liking. He decides to dilute the juice by adding water, making the juice only 7/13 as concentrated as before. 

In comparison to the old undiluted recipe, how much of the new grape juice should he use now, if he calculates it as (7/13) * the previous fraction ((12/16) * (15/6))?

        In a class, 10 out of 14 students participated in a school project. Each of those students prepared 8 models for the science fair. Calculate the total number of models prepared for the science fair by multiplying the fraction of students who participated (10/14) with the number of models each student made (8).

        Your pet dog, Bear, can chase and bring back the ball twice every minute during your playtime. After playing for 6 minutes, how many times did Bear bring the ball back?

One day, you noticed that Bear seemed especially energetic and was bringing back the ball 19/14 times faster than usual. Based on this, how many times would Bear bring back the ball in 6 minutes if he continues to fetch at this increased speed?

This can be represented by (19/14) * (2*6). Calculate and write your answer as a simplified fraction.
