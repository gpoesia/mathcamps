The sum of the lengths of the two known sides of the triangle is 180m+579m = &lt;&lt;180+579=759&gt;&gt;759m.
The sum of the lengths of the two known sides of the triangle is 759m, and the sum of the lengths of all three sides of the triangle is 1039m.
The length of the third side of the triangle is 1039m – 759m = &lt;&lt;1039-759=280&gt;&gt;280m.
