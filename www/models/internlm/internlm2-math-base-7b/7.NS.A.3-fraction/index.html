        Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?

        A giraffe at the local zoo has a peculiar eating habit. When it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves, it eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day. If the zoo calculates the weekly feeding amount by multiplying the daily intake by itself (making the result &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;) and then multiplying that with the regular daily intake, how many pounds of acacia leaves should they prepare for the giraffe for a week? Calculate ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26))^2 * ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26)) and provide your answer.
    </p>

        A compass maker is creating some specialty compasses. 

The compass needle is made from a special material. It takes 27/26 of a pound to create one needle. 

If the maker is trying to produce two identical needles, how much material will he require? 

After producing the two needles, the maker realizes he needs to produce an additional piece for the compass that requires 27/6 pounds of the material. 

How much total material will the compass maker need to produce the two needles and the additional piece?

        Imagine you're a music producer who is working on a new song. Your resources are divided into different sections.

- First, you dedicate 16/4 hours to composing the music and another 16/29 hours to writing the lyrics. This is your initial time investment for the song (let's call it p).

- Then, you spend 28/13 hours for mixing and mastering the song in addition to the initial time investment (let's call this new total time b).

- Suddenly, a drummer you hired for a session uses 18/4 hours less because he finished his parts quickly.

What is the final time you spent on producing the song, if your total time is expressed as (b - (18 / 4))?

The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspect’s involvement. Calculate the value of f.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The investigator needs to first find the ratio of the two changes. The first change is 26/6 = &lt;&lt;26/6=4.33333333333333&gt;&gt;4.33333333333333. The second change is 25/17 = &lt;&lt;25/17=1.47058823529412&gt;&gt;1.47058823529412. The ratio of these two changes is 4.33333333333333/1.47058823529412 = &lt;&lt;4.33333333333333/1.47058823529412=2.95&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;2.95&gt;&gt;2.95.

The next step is to find the difference of the two changes. The first change is 18/8 = &lt;&lt;18/8=2.25&gt;&gt;2.25. The second change is 17/23 = &lt;&lt;17/23=0.739130434782609&gt;&gt;0.739130434782609. The difference of these two changes is 2.25-0.739130434782609 = &lt;&lt;2.25-0.739130434782609=1.5108&gt;&gt;1.5108.

The last step is to multiply the two values. The value of f is 2.95*1.5108 = &lt;&lt;2.95*1.5108=4.45&gt;&gt;4.45.

        You have a paint mixing machine that creates specific shades of color.

The machine starts by mixing 24/8 gallons of red paint. It then pours away 12/8 gallons of the mix. Let 'd' represent the amount of red paint left in the machine.

Finally, the machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color, subtract that from 'd' to find 'x' in gallons, which is the total amount of paint. Find the value of 'x'.

        Let's suppose for a special recipe sandwich, you need to divide a wheel of cheese into 14 equal parts and a pickle jar into 18 equal parts. 

To make one special sandwich, you need 21 parts of the wheel of cheese and 7 parts from the pickle jar.

You've just made these sandwiches and you are down to ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of your original ingredients.

Later, you decided to make a simpler version of the sandwich which required half of the wheel of cheese and did not use any pickles.

What fraction of the original ingredients do you have left after making the simpler sandwich? Calculate the answer by subtracting (2 / 4) from the fraction you had after making the first sandwich.

        Sophia is a researcher who studies sunglasses. She was examining a batch of sunglasses and trying to calculate the average light blocking efficiency.

In the first test, she found that 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays completely, while in the second test, 20 out of every 18 sunglasses also blocked all UV rays.

Sophia decided to add these numbers to her total. Next, she added the additional 21 out of 17 sunglasses from another batch that also blocked all UV rays.

Later, she realized she made a mistake and needed to subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that actually did not block all UV rays.

What is the final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays, according to Sophia's tests and calculations? Please give your answer as a simplified fraction.

        In a beehive, there are sections for honey storage and bee rearing. Each section is classified into many sub-sections. One day, the beekeeper discovered that each honey storage sub-section had (25 / 9) gallons of honey. He also found the same amount of honey in each bee rearing sub-section. 

If he combined the honey from both a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the beekeeper would have a total quantity represented by 'p'. 

However, one honey storage sub-section had an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey. So, if the beekeeper was calculating the total amount from this sub-section plus a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be defined as 's'. 

What quantity of honey ('s') would the beekeeper have in total from this scenario?

        During rainy weather, a small snail moves at a snail-pace covering 17/21 of a meter in an hour. Another slightly faster snail covers 20/24 of a meter in the same time during such weather. 

One rainy day, the first snail started an hour earlier than the second. At the time when the second snail began, a third snail that covers 18/17 of a meter per hour also started moving. 

What is their total distance in meters 1 hour after all three have started moving? Compute the result using the operation ((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) for the first two snails' distance, and multiply this result by (18 / 17) for the total distance , including the third snail.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The first two snails' distance in 1 hour is ((17/21) + (20/24)) = &lt;&lt;(17/21) + (20/24) = 0.8 + 0.833 = 1.633&gt;&gt;1.633 meters. 

The total distance, including the third snail, is 1.633 * 18/17 = &lt;&lt;1.633 * 18/17 = 1.633 * 1.0588 = 1.73004&gt;&gt;1.73004 meters.

        Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements. 

What does Captain Alf’s final calculation come to? Use these steps and corresponding fractions to find your answer.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The distance to the island is 17/2 = &lt;&lt;17/2=8.5&gt;&gt;8.5 nautical miles, and the boat is currently 4/2 = &lt;&lt;4/2=2&gt;&gt;2 nautical miles away. The total distance to the island is 8.5-2 = &lt;&lt;8.5-2=6.5&gt;&gt;6.5 nautical miles. 

The tide is estimated to push the boat off course by 14/9 = &lt;&lt;14/9=1.5&gt;&gt;1.5 nautical miles. The total distance to the island, with the tide, is 6.5+1.5 = &lt;&lt;6.5+1.5=8&gt;&gt;8 nautical miles. 

The fuel efficiency of the boat is 22/15 = &lt;&lt;22/15=1.4&gt;&gt;1.4 nautical miles per gallon. The final calculation is 8 ⋅ 1.4 = &lt;&lt;8⋅1.4=11.2&gt;&gt;11.2.

The first recipe requires (27 / 3) cups flour and (11 / 7) cups sugar. She determines the ratio of flour to sugar by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar. She then subtracts (21 / 26) from this ratio because that's how many cups of sugar her friend says makes the cookies too sweet. After that, she adds (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio to see how many total cups of flour she will need. How many cups of flour will she have in the end?

        There are 26/13 chickens in one farm and 9/16 chickens in another farm. Farmer John calculated the difference between the number of chickens in the two farms. After a week, the number of chickens multiplied by 19/21 due to new chickens born. How many chickens are there now in Farmer John's farm?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of chickens in the first farm is 26/13. The number of chickens in the second farm is 9/16. The number of chickens in the first farm is greater than the number of chickens in the second farm by 26/13-9/16 = &lt;&lt;26/13-9/16= 8/24= 1/3&gt;&gt;1/3. The number of chickens in the first farm is 8/3. The number of chickens in the first farm is 8/3*19/21 = &lt;&lt;8/3*19/21= 8*19/3*21= 152/21&gt;&gt;152/21. The number of chickens in the first farm is 152/21.

        A helicopter traveled a distance of 24/14 miles for a training exercise. During a second exercise, the helicopter flew the same distance. If we let 'w' be the distance flown for each exercise and 't' be the total distance flown for both exercises represented as the product of 'w' times 'w', what is the value of 't'?

        A UFO has made two fuel stops. During the first refuel, the UFO was able to fill 20/16 of its fuel tank. At the second fuel stop, the UFO filled another 24/25 of its tank. Calculate the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The first refuel filled the tank 20/16 = &lt;&lt;20/16=5/4&gt;&gt;5/4 of the way. The second refuel filled the tank 24/25 = &lt;&lt;24/25=24/25&gt;&gt;24/25 of the way. The total refill is 5/4+24/25 = &lt;&lt;5/4+24/25= 9/5+24/25= 9/5+96/25= 9/5+3 21/25= 12 21/25= 12 21/25= 123/25= 123/25= 49/10&gt;&gt;49/10 of the tank.

        Professor Astro is working on his telescope. He believes the power of his telescope is directly proportional to the sum of two fractions. The first fraction is the light gathering power of the lens, which is 24 out of 27. The second fraction is the zooming potential, which is 30 out of 26. So, Professor Astro calculates the sum of these two fractions ((24 / 27) + (30 / 26)). What does he find?
