        A baker baked a total of 928 cookies. He decided to distribute equal amounts of cookies to 186 orphanages. After giving out as many entire sets of cookies as possible to each orphanage, how many cookies does the baker have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The baker distributed 928 cookies / 186 orphanages = 5 cookies per orphanage.
After distributing cookies to each orphanage, the baker has 928 cookies - 5 cookies/orphanage * 186 orphanages = 928 cookies - 930 cookies = -2 cookies left.
The baker has -2 cookies left, which means he doesn't have any cookies left.

        A pizza store has 975 slices of pizza ready to serve. If each pizza box can contain 196 slices, how many left over slices will there be after all the pizza boxes are full?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of leftover slices, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices in each box and find the remainder.
975 slices รท 196 slices/box = 4 boxes with 191 slices and 1 leftover slice.
Therefore, there will be 1 leftover slice after all the pizza boxes are full.

        A wizard casts a spell to summon 932 magical stones. Each powerful creature he summons requires 193 stones. After summoning several creatures, how many stones will the wizard have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The wizard summons several creatures, so the total number of stones used is 193 * number of creatures summoned. The number of creatures summoned is 932 / 193 = 4.82, but since the number of creatures must be a whole number, the wizard can summon 4 creatures. The total stones used is 193 * 4 = 772 stones. The stones left will be 932 - 772 = 160 stones.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The wizard originally summoned 932 / 544 = 1.71 creatures, but since the number of creatures must be a whole number, the wizard can summon only 1 creature.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The number of 22-gallon containers needed to hold 473 gallons of juice is 473/22 = 21.5, which means the company will need 22 containers to hold all the juice.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The gardener can fill up 982 flowers / 555 flowers per flowerbed = &lt;&lt;982/555=1.769&gt;&gt;1.769 flowerbeds.
Since the gardener can only plant whole flowerbeds, the gardener can fill up 1 flowerbed.
The number of flowers left to plant is 982 flowers - 555 flowers = &lt;&lt;982-555=427&gt;&gt;427 flowers.

To find out how many plants will be remaining after dividing 279 by 5, we need to find the remainder.
279 divided by 5 is 55 with a remainder of 4.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        A tailor has 925 meters of fabric. The tailor uses 529 meters of fabric to make each dress. If the tailor uses the fabric evenly for each dress, how many meters of fabric will be left over after completing the dresses?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: If the tailor uses 529 meters of fabric for each dress, the number of dresses that can be made is 925/529 = &lt;&lt;925/529=1.75&gt;&gt;1.75 dresses.
Since the tailor cannot make a fraction of a dress, the tailor can make only 1 dress using 529 meters of fabric.
The amount of fabric left over after making 1 dress is 925 - 529 = &lt;&lt;925-529=396&gt;&gt;396 meters.
### Answer: 396 meters.</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        After making some dresses, the tailor now only has 62 meters of fabric left. If the tailor continues to use 529 meters of fabric to make each dress, how many meters of fabric will be left over after making the dresses?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The tailor started with 925 meters of fabric and now has 62 meters left, so the tailor used 925 - 62 = &lt;&lt;925-62=863&gt;&gt;863 meters of fabric.
If the tailor uses 529 meters of fabric for each dress, the number of dresses that can be made is 863 / 529 = &lt;&lt;863/529=1.63&gt;&gt;1.63 dresses.
Since the tailor can only make whole dresses, the tailor can make only 1 dress using 529 meters of fabric.
The amount of fabric left over after making 1 dress is 863 - 529 = &lt;&lt;863-529=334&gt;&gt;334 meters.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        There are 976 tourists wanting to explore a castle. Each tour group throughout the day accommodates up to 530 people. After all the groups have taken off, how many tourists will be left for the last group of the day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The number of tourists left for the last group of the day is the remainder when 976 tourists are divided by 530 tourists per group.
976 divided by 530 is 1 with a remainder of 446.
Therefore, there will be 446 tourists left for the last group of the day.

        What would happen if the number of tourists wanting to explore the castle was still 976, but this time each group could accommodate up to 726 people? How many tourists would be left for the last group of the day now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The number of tourists left for the last group of the day is the remainder when 976 tourists are divided by 726 tourists per group.
976 divided by 726 is 1 with a remainder of 250.
Therefore, there will be 250 tourists left for the last group of the day.
