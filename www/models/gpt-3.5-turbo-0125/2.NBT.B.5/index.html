        After realizing the little prank his sister pulled on him, Ben sets off to retrieve his notes. He manages to find and get back some of his notes. After checking his collection, he realises that he now has just as many notes as he initially did minus the ones he has remaining after his sister's prank. How many notes did Ben manage to retrieve from his sister?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's denote the number of notes Ben managed to retrieve from his sister as \( x \). We know that Ben initially had 54 notes, his sister took 24 notes, and after the prank, Ben had 30 notes left. After retrieving some notes, Ben has 30 + x notes. This can be represented as the equation:

\[ 54 - 24 + x = 30 + x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 30 + x = 30 + x \]
\[ x = 0 \]

Ben did not manage to retrieve any notes from his sister.
