        Math problem: Determine the value of the sum when adding (74 / 63) and (91 / 78).

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of (74/63) and (91/78), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 63 and 78 is 882.

Converting the fractions to have a common denominator of 882:
(74/63) * (14/14) = 1036/882
(91/78) * (13/13) = 1183/1014

Adding the fractions:
1036/882 + 1183/1014 = (1036*1014 + 1183*882) / (882*1014)
= (1052424 + 1045026) / 896508
= 2097450 / 896508

Simplifying the fraction:
2097450 / 896508 = 233050 / 99612

So, we rewrite 471/25 as 471*89/2225 = 41919/2225. 

Now, we add 41919/2225 + 73/89 = (41919*89 + 73*2225) / 2225*89 = 3730567/198025.

Converting 72/35 to have a denominator of 1715:

11/17 + 72/35

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 17 and 35 is 595.

Converting 11/17 to have a denominator of 595:
(11/17) * (35/35) = 385/595

Adding the fractions:

Converting 65/31 to have a denominator of 1426:
65/31 = (65*46)/(31*46) = 2990/1426

Adding the two fractions:
2945/1426 + 2990/1426 = (2945+2990)/1426 = 5935/1426

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 25 over 63 and 74 over 6, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 63 and 6 is 126. 

So, we rewrite 25/63 as (25*2)/(63*2) = 50/126 and 74/6 as (74*21)/(6*21) = 1554/126.

Now, we add the fractions: 50/126 + 1554/126 = 1604/126.

Simplifying the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2, we get 802/63.

Rewriting 9/47 as (9*63)/(47*63) = 567/2961.

Subtracting, we get 802/63 - 567/2961 = (802*47 - 567*63) / 2961 = (37794 - 35721) / 2961 = 2073 / 2961.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 35/97 and 11/15, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 97 and 15 is 1455.

Converting 35/97 to have a denominator of 1455, we get (35/97) * (15/15) = 525/1455.

Converting 11/15 to have a denominator of 1455, we get (11/15) * (97/97) = 1067/1455.

Now, adding the fractions: 525/1455 + 1067/1455 = (525 + 1067) / 1455 = 1592 / 1455.

The sum of 35/97 and 11/15 in simplest form is 1592/1455.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To subtract fractions, we need to have a common denominator. The common denominator for 70 and 5 is 70. 

11/5 = 154/70 (by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 14)
79/70 = 79/70

Now, we can subtract the fractions:
11/5 - 79/70 = 154/70 - 79/70 = (154 - 79)/70 = 75/70 = 15/14

15/14 = 15*46/644 = 690/644
62/46 = 62*14/644 = 868/644

Now, we can add the fractions:
690/644 + 868/644 = (690 + 868)/644 = 1558/644 = 779/322

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

Converting 52/78 to have a denominator of 624, we get (52*8)/(78*8) = 416/624.

Converting 3068/624 to have a denominator of 23832, we get (3068*38)/(624*38) = 116584/23832.

Converting 37/38 to have a denominator of 23832, we get (37*624)/(38*624) = 23188/23832.

Converting 44/47 to have a denominator of 3525, we get (44/47) * (75/75) = 3300/3525.

Adding the two fractions together, we get 987/3525 + 3300/3525 = 4287/3525.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 84/97 and 25/2, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 97 and 2 is 97*2 = 194. 

Converting 84/97 to have a denominator of 194, we get (84/97)*(2/2) = 168/194.

Converting 25/2 to have a denominator of 194, we get (25/2)*(97/97) = 2425/194.

Now, adding 168/194 and 2425/194, we get (168+2425)/194 = 2593/194.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we found the sum of 84/97 and 25/2 to be 2593/194. 

Now, we need to subtract 100/71 from 2593/194. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 194 and 71 is 194*71 = 13774.

Converting 2593/194 to have a denominator of 13774, we get (2593/194)*(71/71) = 183803/13774.

Converting 100/71 to have a denominator of 13774, we get (100/71)*(194/194) = 19400/13774.

Now, subtracting 19400/13774 from 183803/13774, we get (183803-19400)/13774 = 164403/13774.

Converting 25/2 to have a denominator of 192, we get (25/2)*(96/96) = 1200/192.

Now, adding 168/192 and 1200/192, we get (168+1200)/192 = 1368/192 = 57/8.

Converting 4/78 to have a denominator of 780:
4/78 = (4*10)/(78*10) = 40/780

6/15 = (6*52)/(15*52) = 312/780

Adding 2534/780 and 312/780:

66/21 = (66*26)/(21*26) = 1716/546

Converting 4/78 to have a denominator of 546:
4/78 = (4*7)/(78*7) = 28/546

Now, the difference between the fractions is:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the sum of fractions, we need to have a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 20*97 = 1940.
Converting 23/20 to have a denominator of 1940, we get 23/20 * 97/97 = 2251/1940.
Converting 82/97 to have a denominator of 1940, we get 82/97 * 20/20 = 1640/1940.
Adding the two fractions together, we get (2251 + 1640) / 1940 = 3891 / 1940.

54/88 = 54 * 5 / 88 * 5 = 270/440
28/10 = 28 * 44 / 10 * 44 = 1232/440
Now, we add the fractions:
270/440 + 1232/440 = 1502/440

87/26 = 87 * 480 / (26 * 480) = 41760/12480
2305/480 remains the same.
Now, we add the fractions:

We found that 82/15 + 100/12 = 69/5.

Now, we need to add 46/83 to 69/5. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 83 is 415.

Converting 69/5 to have a denominator of 415, we get 69/5 = 2895/415.
Converting 46/83 to have a denominator of 415, we get 46/83 = 190/415.

Now, adding the fractions:
2895/415 + 190/415 = (2895 + 190) / 415 = 3085 / 415 = 617/83.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the value of ((49 / 57) + (89 / 99)), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 57 and 99 is 57 * 99 = 5643.

Now, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
((49 * 99) / (57 * 99)) + ((89 * 57) / (99 * 57))
= (4851 / 5643) + (5073 / 5643)
= (4851 + 5073) / 5643
= 9924 / 5643

Therefore, ((49 / 57) + (89 / 99)) = 9924 / 5643.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the value of (49 / 57) + (89 / 99) to itself, we first need to find the value of the expression and then add it to itself.

From the previous calculation, we found that (49 / 57) + (89 / 99) = 9924 / 5643.

Adding this value to itself:
(9924 / 5643) + (9924 / 5643) = (9924 + 9924) / 5643 = 19848 / 5643.

Therefore, the sum of adding the value of (49 / 57) + (89 / 99) to itself is 19848 / 5643.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of (59 / 57) + (89 / 99), we first calculate the value of each fraction separately.

For the first fraction:
59 / 57

For the second fraction:
89 / 99

Now, we find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 57 and 99 is 57 * 99 = 5643.

Rewriting the fractions with the common denominator:
(59 * 99) / (57 * 99) + (89 * 57) / (99 * 57)
= (5841 / 5643) + (5073 / 5643)
= (5841 + 5073) / 5643
= 10914 / 5643

Therefore, (59 / 57) + (89 / 99) = 10914 / 5643.

Therefore, the sum of 30/79 and 29/6 is 180/474 + 229/474 = 409/474.

Converting the fractions to have a common denominator:
58/23 = (58*26)/(23*26) = 1508/598
25/26 = (25*23)/(26*23) = 575/598

Converting the fractions to have a common denominator:
45/23 = (45*26)/(23*26) = 1170/598
25/26 = (25*23)/(26*23) = 575/598

Adding the fractions together:
1170/598 + 575/598 = (1170 + 575)/598 = 1745/598

Comparing the sum of 45/23 and 25/26 (1745/598) to the original sum of 58/23 and 25/26 (2083/598), we see that the sum of 45/23 and 25/26 is smaller than the original calculation.

Rewriting the fractions with the common denominator:
297/52 = 297*87/52*87 = 25839/4524
35/87 = 35*52/87*52 = 1820/4524

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We first simplify the division: 94 / 14 = 47 / 7 = 6 5/7 and 50 / 90 = 5 / 9. 

Subtracting these fractions gives us: 6 5/7 - 5/9 = 47/7 - 5/9 = (47*9 - 5*7) / (7*9) = (423 - 35) / 63 = 388 / 63.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know that 94 / 14 = 6 5/7.

Now, we need to calculate 50 / 19. This simplifies to 50 / 19.

Subtracting these fractions gives us: 6 5/7 - 50/19 = 47/7 - 50/19 = (47*19 - 50*7) / (7*19) = (893 - 350) / 133 = 543 / 133.

53/38 = 53*79/38*79 = 4187/3002
Now, we add the fractions:
2280/3002 + 4187/3002 = (2280 + 4187)/3002 = 6467/3002

Now, we add 5/11 to the result:
6467/3002 + 5/11 = (6467*11 + 5*3002)/(3002*11) = 71137/33022.

1 = 38/38

Converting 60/3 to have a denominator of 258, we get (60*86)/(3*86) = 516/258.

Now, adding 48/258 and 516/258, we get (48+516)/258 = 564/258.

8292/5546 + 84/30 = (8292*30 + 84*5546)/(5546*30) = (248760 + 465564) / 166380 = 714324 / 166380 = 357162 / 83190 = 119054 / 27730.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">In the altered scenario, the first recipe demands 94/84 gallons of milk and the second recipe demands 75/34 gallons of milk.

To find the total amount of milk needed for both recipes in the altered scenario, we add the amounts of milk needed for each recipe:
94/84 + 75/34

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 84 and 34 is 84*34 = 2856.

Converting the fractions to have a common denominator:
94/84 = (94*34)/(84*34) = 3196/2856
75/34 = (75*84)/(34*84) = 6300/2856

Adding the fractions:
3196/2856 + 6300/2856 = (3196 + 6300)/2856 = 9496/2856

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 78 and 83 is 78*83 = 6474. 

Converting both fractions to have a denominator of 6474:

44/83 = (44*78)/(83*78) = 3432/6474

Adding the fractions:
4233/6474 + 3432/6474 = (4233 + 3432)/6474 = 7665/6474

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found the sum of 51/78 and 44/83 to be 7665/6474. 

To add 7665/6474 and 71/92, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6474 and 92 is 6474*92 = 595368.

Converting both fractions to have a denominator of 595368:
7665/6474 = (7665*92)/(6474*92) = 705180/595368
71/92 = (71*6474)/(92*6474) = 457854/595368

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, we need to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 85 and 55 is 425. We rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

4772/2508 = (4772 * 38) / (2508 * 38) = 181336 / 95264

47/38 = (47 * 2508) / (38 * 2508) = 117676 / 95264

Adding these fractions:

43/76 = (43 * 33) / (76 * 33) = 1419 / 2508

Adding the fractions:

1419/2508 + 35/33 = (1419 + 2508*35) / 2508 = (1419 + 87780) / 2508 = 89199 / 2508

Converting 47/16 to have a denominator of 80:

Converting 96/10 to have a denominator of 80:
96/10 = (96*8)/(10*8) = 768/80

Now, we can add the fractions:
235/80 + 768/80 = (235 + 768)/80 = 1003/80

Expressing the sum as a mixed fraction:

Converting 72/22 to have a denominator of 80:
72/22 = (72*4)/(22*4) = 288/88

Subtracting 288/88 from 1003/80:

Subtracting 92/89 from 5176/2340:
5176/2340 - 92/89

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2340 and 89 is 2340*89 = 208260.

Rewriting the fractions with the common denominator:
5176/2340 = (5176*89)/(2340*89) = 460264/208260
92/89 = (92*2340)/(89*2340) = 214080/208260

Subtracting the fractions:
460264/208260 - 214080/208260 = (460264 - 214080)/208260 = 246184/208260 = 123092/104130

        If we had originally started with 93 instead of 54, and added 62/30 to that, what would be the new result? Express the answer in simplest terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we simplify 62/30 to 31/15. Then, we add 93 and 31/15 together:

93 + 31/15 = 93 + 2 1/15 = 95 1/15.

Therefore, the new result would be 95 1/15.
### Answer: 95 1/15.</pre>

        What value do you get by adding 85/29 and 47/7?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 29 and 7 is 203. So, we rewrite the fractions with a common denominator:
85/29 = (85*7)/(29*7) = 595/203
47/7 = (47*29)/(7*29) = 1363/203

Now, we add the fractions:
595/203 + 1363/203 = (595 + 1363)/203 = 1958/203

### Answer: 1958/203.</pre>

        After finding the result of adding 85/29 and 47/7, what is the new total if you also add 81/42?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add 1958/203 and 81/42, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 203 and 42 is 8586. So, we rewrite the fractions with a common denominator:
1958/203 = (1958*42)/(203*42) = 82136/8586
81/42 = (81*203)/(42*203) = 16443/8586

Now, we add the fractions:
82136/8586 + 16443/8586 = (82136 + 16443)/8586 = 98579/8586

        After calculating the result from the previous problem, consider a new situation: You have now 85/64 of a pound of oranges and 47/7 pounds of apples. What is the new total weight of your fruits in pounds?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total weight of the fruits, we need to add the weights of the oranges and apples. We already have the weights in fractions:

85/64 pounds of oranges
47/7 pounds of apples

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 64 and 7 is 448. So, we rewrite the fractions with a common denominator:
85/64 = (85*7)/(64*7) = 595/448
47/7 = (47*64)/(7*64) = 3008/448

Now, we add the fractions:
595/448 + 3008/448 = (595 + 3008)/448 = 3603/448

### Answer: 3603/448 pounds.</pre>
