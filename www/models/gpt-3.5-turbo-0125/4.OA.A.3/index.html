        A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins she’d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
- In the second part of the Antarctic, there were 598 penguins divided evenly among 26 ice floes, so there were 598/26 = 23 penguins on each ice floe.
- The penguin population in the first place increased by 49, so there were initially 35+49 = 84 penguins.
- She decided to take 33 more penguins into account, but then had to subtract 10, so she counted 84+33-10 = 107 penguins.
- Adding the penguins left at her base camp, there were 20 adults + 14 chicks = 34 penguins.
- In total, she counted 107 + 34 = 141 penguins.

        If a cloud releases 47 millimeters of rainfall per hour over a one hour period, and the average cloud typically releases 775 millimeters of rainfall over the course of 31 hours, find the amount of rainfall from the following condition. 

Subtract 22 from the average rainfall of the typical cloud per hour then multiply this by 23. Add this result to a constant cloud factor of 42. Add this new result to the hourly rainfall of the initial cloud and subtract 2 from it. What is the resultant millimeters of rainfall?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the steps:
1. Subtract 22 from the average rainfall of the typical cloud per hour: 775 - 22 = 753 millimeters.
2. Multiply this by 23: 753 * 23 = 17319 millimeters.
3. Add this result to a constant cloud factor of 42: 17319 + 42 = 17361 millimeters.
4. Add this new result to the hourly rainfall of the initial cloud: 17361 + 47 = 17408 millimeters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first find Tommy's speed when he slows down by 3 mph. His speed would be 74/37 - 3 = 74/37 - 111/37 = -37/37 = 1 mile per hour.

To find Tommy's average speed, we can use the formula: Average speed = 2 * (Initial speed * Slower speed) / (Initial speed + Slower speed).

Plugging in the values, we get: Average speed = 2 * (74/37 * 1) / (74/37 + 1) = 2 * (74/37) / (111/37) = 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the number of Velociraptor eggs that are expected to successfully hatch, we need to subtract the unfertilized eggs from the total number of eggs laid by the Velociraptors.

Total number of eggs laid by the Velociraptors: 49
Number of unfertilized eggs: 46

Number of eggs expected to hatch: 49 - 46 = 3

        Continuing off the previous scenario, the wardens realized that they had made a mistake in their calculations. Each box actually contained 46 dinosaurs, not 27. If this was the case, how many total eggs are expected to be laid by the Velociraptors this week?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">If each box actually contained 46 dinosaurs, then the total number of new dinosaur types added would be 972 / 46 = 21.
The difference in the number of Velociraptors and new dinosaur types is 43 - 21 = 22.
Multiplying this difference by 7 gives us 22 * 7 = 154 total eggs laid by the Velociraptors that week.

        A factory has just released a new robot model, where each model has 17 transistors and each transistor may have 16 separate connections. One of the newly manufactured robots by accident was made with one less connection than standard. However, to compensate for the mistake, an extra 41 connections were added elsewhere. What is the total number of connections in the strangely built robot?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Each robot should have 17 transistors * 16 connections = &lt;&lt;17*16=272&gt;&gt;272 connections.
Since one connection was missing, the robot had 272 - 1 = &lt;&lt;272-1=271&gt;&gt;271 connections.
After adding 41 extra connections, the total number of connections became 271 + 41 = &lt;&lt;271+41=312&gt;&gt;312 connections.

        There's this mystical ring that, after you perform a special chant, it will grant you powers based on a complex magic formula. If the first step of the magical formula is subtracting 5 from 23 and then multiplying by the number of magical chants you perform, which in this case is 6. After that, the result is multiplied by 7 and again by 1. However, for the final step, you subtract 48 from the result. If you follow these steps, how powerful will the ring's magic be?

        A jewelry maker starts with 38 beads to make a bracelet. However, the number of beads was not right, so she removed a number of beads equal to dividing 560 by 40. However, she thinks her initial count may have been wrong and she may have actually started with 15 more beads than she initially thought. After adjusting the count and removing some beads, she adds one more bead, and then 39 more. How many beads does the jewelry maker have now?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jewelry maker removed 560/40 = 14 beads.
2. If she actually started with 15 more beads, then her initial count was 38 + 15 = 53 beads.
3. After removing 14 beads, she had 53 - 14 = 39 beads.
4. She then added 1 bead, bringing the total to 39 + 1 = 40 beads.
5. Finally, she added 39 more beads, making the total number of beads 40 + 39 = 79 beads.

        In the continuation of the previous story, the jewelry maker decided to make another adjustment after adding beads to her bracelet. She then removed again the same number of beads she removed earlier, equal to dividing 560 by 40. After that, she finds a small box with an additional 20 beads in it that she decides to add to the bracelet. How many beads does the jewelry maker have now on her bracelet?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's calculate the number of beads on the bracelet after each step:

1. After the first adjustment, she had 40 beads on the bracelet.
2. She removed 560/40 = 14 beads again, leaving her with 40 - 14 = 26 beads.
3. She then found 20 more beads, bringing the total to 26 + 20 = 46 beads.

Therefore, the jewelry maker now has 46 beads on her bracelet.

        In a different scenario, suppose the jewelry maker initially had 50 beads instead of 38. She still removed a number of beads equal to 560 divided by 40. Afterwards, she realized she might have actually started with 15 more beads than she originally thought. After correcting her count and removing some beads, she added one more bead, and then 39 more beads. How many beads does the jewelry maker have now in this case?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's follow the same steps as before but with the initial count of 50 beads:

1. The jewelry maker removed 560/40 = 14 beads.
2. If she actually started with 15 more beads, then her initial count was 50 + 15 = 65 beads.
3. After removing 14 beads, she had 65 - 14 = 51 beads.
4. She then added 1 bead, bringing the total to 51 + 1 = 52 beads.
5. Finally, she added 39 more beads, making the total number of beads 52 + 39 = 91 beads.

        A company produces 36 marshmallow packs in an hour. To meet a sudden increase in demand, they decide to increase their production. They add an extra 350 marshmallows to their daily production, which is distributed evenly over 7 hours of their working day. Additionally, they add another 6 marshmallow packs to their hourly production. But, due to some limitations, they end up producing 43 less packs per hour than their goal. How many marshmallow packs per hour are they now producing?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first find the total number of marshmallow packs they produce in a day after adding the extra 350 marshmallows: 36 packs/hour * 7 hours/day = 252 packs/day.
Adding the extra 350 marshmallows, the total number of packs they produce in a day is 252 packs/day + 350 packs = 602 packs/day.
Now, let's find the total number of marshmallow packs they produce in an hour after adding the extra 6 marshmallow packs: 36 packs/hour + 6 packs = 42 packs/hour.
Since they are producing 43 less packs per hour than their goal, the total number of packs they are now producing per hour is 42 packs/hour - 43 packs/hour = 42 packs/hour - 1 pack/hour = 41 packs/hour.

        A tiger has an average step length of 9 meters. If a tiger took two steps and then leaped 44 meters, it would have covered a certain distance. Another tiger covered a distance combining 23 meters with a leap and a 46-meter run but then retraces the distance equal to the first tiger's steps and the leap. How much distance did the second tiger cover finally?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The first tiger covered 9*2 + 44 = 18 + 44 = 62 meters initially.
The second tiger covered 23 + 46 = 69 meters initially.
The second tiger retraced 62 meters, so the total distance covered by the second tiger is 69 - 62 = &lt;&lt;69-62=7&gt;&gt;7 meters.

        Continuing from the previous situation, after retracing the distance equal to the first tiger's steps and the leap, the second tiger then decides to run an additional 30 meters before making a 44-meter leap. How much total distance did the second tiger cover after all these movements?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: After retracing 62 meters, the second tiger ran an additional 30 meters and then leaped 44 meters.
Therefore, the total distance covered by the second tiger after all these movements is 62 + 30 + 44 = &lt;&lt;62+30+44=136&gt;&gt;136 meters.

        A toothpaste factory produces 26 tubes of toothpaste every hour. On Sundays, they work for 7 hours and produce additional 8 tubes of toothpaste. So, in one Sunday, they produce ((26 * 7) + 8) tubes.

The following Monday, they continue their production by adding another 31 tubes to their Sunday's total.

In parallel, in the packaging department, they have 50 empty boxes. They use 19 of them for another department, leaving them with (50 - 19) boxes.

The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is calculated by adding the packaged boxes number with Monday's production.

The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed.

        A treasure chest contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds. Unfortunately, 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed. The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest. 

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

What is the value (m) of the remaining treasure?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first find the value of the first chest (g):
Number of real stones in the first chest = 23 (emeralds) + 30 (diamonds) - 39 (fake stones) = 14 real stones
g = 14^2 - 37 = 196 - 37 = 159

Now, let's find the value of the second chest:
Number of rubies left after sharing = 540 / 45 - 3 = 12 rubies
x = 159 - 12 = 147

Now, let's find the value of the remaining treasure:
Number of stones left after discarding damaged ones = 23 (pearls) + 11 (zirconias) - 9 = 25 stones
m = 147 - 25 = 122

        A hiker traveled an average of 900 miles in 36 days. One day, he increases his daily average to 16 miles. This reduces his remaining journey by a certain number of days. After that, he finds a shortcut which saves him an additional 4 days, and a friendly traveller advised him of another path that will save him 40 days. If he also saves 21 days due to good weather, how many days in total did he save on his journey?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first find the total distance of the hiker's journey: 900 miles / 36 days = 25 miles per day.
After increasing his daily average to 16 miles, he reduces his remaining journey by 25 - 16 = 9 miles per day.
The reduction in days due to the increase in daily average is 9 miles/day * 36 days = 324 miles.
The shortcut saves him an additional 4 days, the new path saves him 40 days, and good weather saves him 21 days, for a total of 4 + 40 + 21 = 65 days saved.

        A cat started playing with yarn balls. In her first game, she managed to accumulate 5 yarn balls. In her second game, she got as many balls as the square of what she obtained in the first game plus 8 more. Finally, she lost some of her balls in her third game due to a playful dog. She ended the game with a number of balls which is 25 times the difference between 45 and what she accumulated from the second game. How many yarn balls does the cat have now?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's denote the number of yarn balls the cat had after the first game as \( x \).  
In the second game, the cat got \( x^2 + 8 \) yarn balls.  
After the third game, the cat had \( 25(45 - (x^2 + 8)) \) yarn balls.  
Since the cat started with 5 yarn balls, we have the equation:  
\( x + x^2 + 8 + 25(45 - (x^2 + 8)) = 5 \)  
Solving this equation, we find that \( x = 2 \).  
Therefore, the cat has \( 25(45 - (2^2 + 8)) = 25(45 - 12) = 25(33) = 825 \) yarn balls now.

        The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the steps your friend took to figure out the total number of squares needed:

1. Subtract 32 from 37: 37 - 32 = 5
2. Add 42 to the result: 5 + 42 = 47
3. Subtract 37 from that total: 47 - 37 = 10

Now, let's calculate the total number of squares needed for minutes and seconds:

1. Add 41 to 25: 41 + 25 = 66
2. Add 28 to the result: 66 + 28 = 94
3. Add 17 to the result: 94 + 17 = 111

Now, let's calculate the reduced total number of squares:

1. Reduce the total number of squares by 23: 111 - 23 = 88

Finally, let's add the number of squares needed for hours to the reduced total:

88 + 10 = 98

Therefore, your friend would need a total of 98 squares to complete their quirky clock project.

        Your clockmaker friend continues to work at their quirky clock. They thought about the previous calculation for hour squares and realized they made a mistake. Instead of subtracting 37 from the sum of the unfinished hour squares (after adding 42), they should have subtracted only 13. 

So, they re-did the maths: subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted only 13 from that total.

Everything else remained the same, including the additional 25 squares for the minutes, followed by another 28 squares for the seconds. The following calculations also didn't change: they added 41 to 25, added 28 to the result and then added 17 to the final number.

But, just like before, they realized they still lack some material and decided to go on with their decision to reduce the total number of squares by 23. In the end, they added this reduced total to the newly calculated number for hours (after subtracting 13 instead of 37).

Can you help your friend figure out (again!) how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock project with the new calculation?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first calculate the number of squares needed for hours using the corrected calculation:

1. Subtract 32 from 37: 37 - 32 = 5
2. Add 42 to the result: 5 + 42 = 47
3. Subtract 13 from that total: 47 - 13 = 34

Now, let's calculate the total number of squares needed for minutes and seconds:

1. Add 41 to 25: 41 + 25 = 66
2. Add 28 to the result: 66 + 28 = 94
3. Add 17 to the result: 94 + 17 = 111

Now, let's calculate the reduced total number of squares:

1. Reduce the total number of squares by 23: 111 - 23 = 88

Finally, let's add the number of squares needed for hours to the reduced total:
