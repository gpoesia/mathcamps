    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation 74 = 91g - 24 for g, we first add 24 to both sides to isolate the term with g:
74 + 24 = 91g - 24 + 24,
98 = 91g.

Next, we divide both sides by 91 to solve for g:
98/91 = (91g)/91,
g = 98/91.

Therefore, the solution to the equation is g = 98/91.
### Answer: g = 98/91.</pre>
