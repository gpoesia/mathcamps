        John has been learning to add and subtract fractions at school. He was given a problem during his homework that puzzled him. He had to take the sum of 48/56 and 95/23 and then subtract 34/26 from the result. What was the value that John found for this operation? Answer in simplest form.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we find the sum of 48/56 and 95/23:
48/56 + 95/23 = (48*23 + 95*56) / (56*23) = (1104 + 5320) / 1288 = 6424 / 1288 = 5.

Next, we subtract 34/26 from the result:
5 - 34/26 = 5 - (34*56) / (26*56) = 5 - 1904 / 1456 = 5 - 47/36 = (5*36 - 47) / 36 = 163 / 36.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65:
88/9 + 28/65 = (88*65 + 9*28) / (9*65) = (5720 + 252) / 585 = 5972 / 585

Next, we subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result:
5972/585 - 18/37 = (5972*37 - 18*585) / (585*37) = (221564 - 10530) / 21645 = 211034 / 21645

Therefore, the result expressed as a simple fraction is 211034/21645.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To simplify (63 / 41) + (44 / 50), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 41 and 50 is 2050.

(44 / 50) * (41 / 41) = 1804 / 2050

Adding the fractions:
(3150 + 1804) / 2050 = 4954 / 2050

Simplifying the fraction:
4954 and 2050 share a common factor of 2.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of cake, we need to add the fractions together. First, we need to find a common denominator for 41 and 77, which is 41 * 77 = 3157.

John had 71/41 of a cake left, which is equivalent to (71*77)/(41*77) = 547/3157 of a cake.
Emily added 41/77 of another cake, which is equivalent to (41*41)/(77*41) = 1681/3157 of a cake.

Adding these fractions together, we get:
547/3157 + 1681/3157 = 2228/3157.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions 37/18 and 24/60, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 60 is 180.

Converting 37/18 to have a denominator of 180:
37/18 = (37*10)/(18*10) = 370/180

Converting 24/60 to have a denominator of 180:
24/60 = (24*3)/(60*3) = 72/180

Now, we can add the fractions:
370/180 + 72/180 = (370 + 72)/180 = 442/180

Adding 221/90 to 92/28:
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 90 and 28 is 2520.

Converting 221/90 to have a denominator of 2520:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 73 and 77 is 73*77 = 5621. 

So, we rewrite 83/73 and 53/77 with the common denominator:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 14/89, 24/34, and 44/87, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 89, 34, and 87 is 89*34*87 = 264366. 

Converting the fractions to have a common denominator of 264366:
14/89 = (14*2974)/(89*2974) = 41516/264366,
24/34 = (24*7781)/(34*7781) = 186744/264366,
44/87 = (44*3042)/(87*3042) = 133848/264366.

Adding the fractions together:
41516/264366 + 186744/264366 + 133848/264366 = (41516 + 186744 + 133848)/264366 = 361108/264366.

Therefore, the sum of 14/89, 24/34, and 44/87 is 361108/264366, which simplifies to 180554/132183.

Now, let's add this result to the third fraction:
7125/2940 + 99/59 = (7125*59 + 2940*99) / (2940*59) = (420375 + 290460) / 173460 = 710835 / 173460

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Step 1: \( \frac{91}{16} - \frac{76}{30} \)

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 16 and 30 is 240.

\( \frac{91 \times 15}{16 \times 15} - \frac{76 \times 8}{30 \times 8} \)

\( = \frac{1365}{240} - \frac{608}{240} \)

\( = \frac{1365 - 608}{240} \)

\( = \frac{757}{240} \)

Step 2: \( \frac{757}{240} + \frac{18}{44} \)

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 240 and 44 is 5280.

\( \frac{757 \times 22}{240 \times 22} + \frac{18 \times 120}{44 \times 120} \)

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we find the sum of the new fractions:
(78/93) + (89/36) = (288/279) + (890/360) = (288*360 + 890*279) / (279*360) = (103680 + 248310) / 100440 = 351990 / 100440 = 11733 / 3348.

Next, we add this sum to itself:
(11733/3348) + (11733/3348) = (23466/3348) = 7833/1116.

        Let's consider that 93 is divided by 34 to get a fraction value, from which is subtracted another fraction 77/74. What would be the result as a simplified fraction?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first divide 93 by 34 to get a fraction value: 93/34.

Now, let's subtract 77/74 from this fraction: (93/34) - (77/74).

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is the least common multiple of 34 and 74, which is 34*74 = 2516.

Now, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
(93/34)*(74/74) - (77/74)*(34/34)
= (93*74)/(34*74) - (77*34)/(74*34)
= (6862/2516) - (2618/2516)
= (6862 - 2618)/2516

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 75 and 92 is 75 * 92 = 6900.
Converting the fractions:
92/75 = (92 * 92)/(75 * 92) = 8464/6900
66/92 = (66 * 75)/(92 * 75) = 4950/6900
Adding the fractions:
8464/6900 + 4950/6900 = (8464 + 4950)/6900 = 13414/6900

92/75 + 66/92 = 6707/3450

Now, we can subtract the sum from 97/17:
97/17 - 6707/3450 = (97*3450 - 6707*17) / (17*3450) = (333150 - 113819) / 58650 = 219331 / 58650

73/22 = (73*65)/(22*65) = 4745/1430

Adding the two fractions together:

Now, add (3 / 46) to the above result:
6893 / 483 + 3 / 46 = (6893 * 46 + 3 * 483) / (483 * 46) = (317878 + 1449) / 22158 = 319327 / 22158

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions 31/98 and 60/4, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 98 and 4 is 98. 

Converting 60/4 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 98:
60/4 = (60*24)/(4*24) = 1440/96

Now, we can add the fractions:
31/98 + 1440/96 = (31*96 + 1440*98)/(98*96) = (2976 + 141120)/9408 = 144096/9408 = 1512/98 = 756/49

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6:

13/6 + 7/2 = 13/6 + 21/6

        Compute ((75 / 66) + (81 / 61)), and give your answer as a fraction reduced to its lowest term.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we find a common denominator for the fractions:
((75 / 66) + (81 / 61)) = (75*61 / 66*61) + (81*66 / 61*66) = (4575 / 4026) + (5346 / 4026) = (4575 + 5346) / 4026 = 9921 / 4026.

The fraction 9921/4026 can be reduced to its lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
9921 / 4026 = 3307 / 1342.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We already found that ((75 / 66) + (81 / 61)) = 3307/1342. 

Now, we add (47 / 19) to this sum:
3307/1342 + 47/19 = (3307*19 + 47*1342) / (1342*19) = (62833 + 63374) / 25498 = 126207 / 25498.

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 13:
126207 / 25498 = 9701 / 1961.

        Consider two identical fractions, t, each equal to sum of 53/18 and 21/99. Find the total sum, l, of these fractions and present your answer as a simple fraction.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Given fractions:
t = 53/18 + 21/99

To find the common denominator, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 99:
18 = 2 * 3^2
99 = 3^2 * 11

LCM(18, 99) = 2 * 3^2 * 11 = 594

Rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
t = (53*33)/(18*33) + (21*6)/(99*6)
t = 1854/594 + 126/594
t = 1980/594

Since we have two identical fractions, the total sum l is:
l = 2 * t
l = 2 * 1980/594
l = 3960/594
l = 220/33

        First, calculate the result of 58/49 + 31/34. Then, add that result to the fraction 74/38. What is the final result as a simple fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, find a common denominator for the fractions 58/49 and 31/34. The least common multiple of 49 and 34 is 49*34 = 1666. 

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 1666:
58/49 = (58*34)/(49*34) = 1972/1666
31/34 = (31*49)/(34*49) = 1519/1666

Adding the fractions:
1972/1666 + 1519/1666 = (1972 + 1519)/1666 = 3491/1666

Now, add 74/38 to the result:
3491/1666 + 74/38 = (3491*38 + 74*1666)/(1666*38) = (132458 + 123524)/63308 = 255982/63308

        Given that Evan has read 51/18 of his novel, and Olivia has read (8/42) after reading the same amount of novel as Evan, how much of the novel has Olivia read in total? Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much of the novel Olivia has read, we first need to find the fraction of the novel Evan has read. 

Evan has read 51/18 of the novel, which simplifies to 17/6.

Olivia has read the same amount of the novel as Evan, which is 17/6.

Olivia has read an additional 8/42 of the novel, which simplifies to 4/21.

To find out how much of the novel Olivia has read in total, we add the fractions:
17/6 + 4/21 = (17*7)/(6*7) + 4/21 = 119/42 + 4/21 = (119*2)/(42*2) + 4/21 = 238/84 + 4/21 = 238/84 + 16/84 = 254/84 = 127/42.

Therefore, Olivia has read 127/42 of the novel in total.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Since Olivia has read 127/42 of the novel, Evan continues to read and finishes the same amount as Olivia had read. Therefore, Evan reads an additional 127/42 of the novel.

To find out how much of the novel Evan has read in total, we add the fractions:
17/6 + 127/42 = (17*7)/(6*7) + 127/42 = 119/42 + 127/42 = (119+127)/42 = 246/42 = 123/21.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Given that Olivia initially read 3/42 of the novel, which simplifies to 1/14.

Olivia then read the same amount of the novel as Evan, which is 17/6.

To find out how much of the novel Olivia has read in total, we add the fractions:
1/14 + 17/6 = (1*6)/(14*6) + 17/6 = 6/84 + 17/6 = 6/84 + 238/84 = 244/84 = 61/21.

Converting 7/47 to have a denominator of 3055, we get (7/47) * (65/65) = 455/3055.

Now, adding the fractions, we get 3525/3055 + 455/3055 = 3980/3055.

Simplifying the fraction 3980/3055, we get 796/611.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 74/52 and 70/32, we need to first find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 52 and 32 is 416.

Converting 74/52 to have a denominator of 416:
74/52 * 8/8 = 592/416

Converting 70/32 to have a denominator of 416:
70/32 * 13/13 = 910/416

Now, adding the fractions:
592/416 + 910/416 = (592 + 910) / 416 = 1502/416

To find the sum of 1457/836 and 94/59, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 836 and 59 is 49204.

Converting 1457/836 to have a denominator of 49204, we get (1457*59)/(836*59) = 85963/49204.

Converting 94/59 to have a denominator of 49204, we get (94*836)/(59*836) = 78584/49204.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To simplify the expression ((73 / 27) - (23 / 48)), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

First, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of 27 and 48, which is 432.

Rewriting the fractions with the common denominator:
((73 * 16) / (27 * 16)) - ((23 * 9) / (48 * 9))
= (1168 / 432) - (207 / 432)

Now, subtracting the fractions:
(1168 - 207) / 432

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We already found that the original expression ((73 / 27) - (23 / 48)) simplifies to 961/432.

Subtracting the fraction 61/59 from 961/432:

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 432 * 59 = 25488.

Rewriting the fractions with the common denominator:
(961 * 59) / (432 * 59) - (61 * 432) / (59 * 432)
= (56699 / 25488) - (26352 / 25488)

Now, subtracting the fractions:
(56699 - 26352) / 25488

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 23 * 67 = 1541.

Rewriting the fractions with the common denominator:
(827 * 67) / 1541 + (92 * 23) / 1541

18 = (18 * 23) / 23 = 414 / 23.

Substitute this back into the expression:

        Let's say there is a wholesaler who has 41/26 barrels of olive oil in their warehouse. They sell a portion of the oil which is equivalent to 41/72 barrels. How much olive oil do they have now? Express your answer as a simple fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much olive oil the wholesaler has left, we need to subtract the portion they sold from the total amount they had initially.

Total amount of olive oil = 41/26 barrels
Amount sold = 41/72 barrels

Amount left = Total amount - Amount sold
Amount left = 41/26 - 41/72
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 72 in this case.

Amount left = (41/26)*(72/72) - (41/72)
Amount left = 2952/1872 - 533/1872
Amount left = (2952 - 533)/1872
Amount left = 2419/1872

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 85/75 and 88/56, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 75 and 56 is 420.

85/75 = (85*4)/(75*4) = 340/300

88/56 = (88*7)/(56*7) = 616/392

Now, we add the fractions:

340/300 + 616/392 = (340*392 + 616*300) / (300*392) = (133280 + 184800) / 117600 = 318080 / 117600
