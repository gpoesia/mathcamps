        In their game, Kyle threw a ball for a distance of 18/4 yards, while Lisa threw the same ball for a distance of 19/9 yards. How many yards did the ball travel in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance the ball traveled, we need to add the distances Kyle and Lisa threw the ball.

Kyle threw the ball for a distance of 18/4 yards, which simplifies to 4.5 yards.
Lisa threw the ball for a distance of 19/9 yards, which simplifies to 2.11 yards (rounded to two decimal places).

Adding the distances:
4.5 yards + 2.11 yards = 6.61 yards.

Therefore, the ball traveled a total of 6.61 yards.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the lengths of the two pieces of rope, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 12 and 17 is 204. 

So, 15/12 meters is equivalent to 15/12 * 17/17 = 255/204 meters.
And 17/17 meters is equivalent to 17/17 * 12/12 = 204/204 meters.

        Now assume the farmer's first apple tree produced 10/9 bushels instead of 10/11 bushels in the morning. With the same amount of apples in the afternoon, how many bushels of apples did this tree produce in one day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for 10/9 and 17/11. The least common multiple of 9 and 11 is 99.

Converting 10/9 to have a denominator of 99:
10/9 * 11/11 = 110/99

Now we can add the two fractions:
110/99 + 17/11 = (110*11)/(99*11) + 17*9/(11*9) = 1210/99 + 153/99 = 1363/99

Therefore, the tree produced 1363/99 bushels of apples in one day.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of food Mary has given to the monkeys and giraffes, we need to add the amounts of food given to each animal.

Mary gave 6/20 + 18/15 pounds of food in total.
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 15 is 60.

Converting 6/20 to have a denominator of 60:
6/20 = (6*3)/(20*3) = 18/60

Converting 18/15 to have a denominator of 60:
18/15 = (18*4)/(15*4) = 72/60

Now, adding the fractions:
18/60 + 72/60 = 90/60 = 3/2

The total amount of food given to the monkeys, giraffes, and elephants is:
3/2 + 19/11

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 11 is 22.

Converting 3/2 to have a denominator of 22:
3/2 = (3*11)/(2*11) = 33/22

Now, adding the fractions:
33/22 + 19/11 = 33/22 + (19*2)/(11*2) = 33/22 + 38/22 = 71/22

    <pre class="model-raw-response">If Mary actually gave the giraffes 18/19 pounds of food instead of 18/15 pounds, we need to recalculate the total amount of food given to the monkeys and giraffes.

Mary gave 6/20 pounds of food to the monkeys and 18/19 pounds of food to the giraffes.

To find the total amount of food given to the monkeys and giraffes, we add the amounts of food given to each animal.

Converting 6/20 to have a denominator of 19:
6/20 = (6*19)/(20*19) = 114/380

Now, adding the fractions:
114/380 + 18/19 = 114/380 + (18*20)/(19*20) = 114/380 + 360/380 = 474/380 = 237/190

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of Bob's jacket after the alteration, we need to subtract 14/16 meters from the original length of 14/3 meters.

First, we need to find a common denominator for 3 and 16, which is 48.

14/3 = 14/3 * 16/16 = 224/48 meters
14/16 = 14/16 * 3/3 = 42/48 meters

Now, we can subtract 42/48 meters from 224/48 meters:

182/48 = 182/48 meters
9/4 = 9/4 * 12/12 = 108/48 meters

Now, we can subtract 108/48 meters from 182/48 meters:

        Mr. Carpenter makes crafting chairs a meticulous process. He takes 5/3 hours to build the frame and additional 10/13 hours to upholster it. How long does it take for him to build a chair from start to finish?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total time Mr. Carpenter takes to build a chair, we need to add the time it takes to build the frame and the time it takes to upholster it.

Building the frame takes 5/3 hours and upholstering takes 10/13 hours.

Total time = 5/3 + 10/13
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 39.

Total time = (5/3)*(13/13) + (10/13)*(3/3)
Total time = 65/39 + 30/39
Total time = 95/39

Therefore, it takes Mr. Carpenter 95/39 hours to build a chair from start to finish.

Total time = (5/3)*(247/247) + (10/13)*(57/57) + (8/19)*(39/39)
Total time = 1235/741 + 570/741 + 312/741

Total time = (5/10)*(13/13) + (10/13)*(2/2)
Total time = 65/130 + 20/26
Total time = 65/130 + 40/130

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Bob has 11/3 + 12/19 dollars in total in his wallet.
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 3*19 = 57.

Converting 12/19 to have a denominator of 57, we get 12/19 = 12*3/19*3 = 36/57.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many chairs are made by both machines in one hour, we need to add the number of chairs made by each machine.

Machine 1 makes 4/14 of a chair every hour, which simplifies to 2/7 of a chair.

Adding the number of chairs made by both machines:
2/7 + 5 = 5 2/7 = 37/7 chairs.

Therefore, both machines make 37/7 chairs in one hour.

The weight of the meat used in the sandwich is x + 13/9 pounds.

Given that the total weight of the two types of meat per sandwich is 229/68 pounds, we have:

x + 13/9 = 229/68

To solve for x, we first find a common denominator, which is 612:

x = 229/68 - 13/9
x = (229*9)/(68*9) - (13*68)/(9*68)
x = 2061/612 - 884/612

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The extension added 8/11 meters to the original length of 18/19 meters. The total length of the sleeping bag now is 18/19 + 8/11 = (18*11 + 8*19) / (19*11) = (198 + 152) / 209 = 350 / 209 meters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much magic dust the fairy has left, we first need to add up the total amount of magic dust she used over the field and apple trees.

The fairy used 11/12 oz + 9/10 oz of magic dust in total.
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12*10 = 120.
Converting 11/12 to have a denominator of 120, we get 110/120.
Converting 9/10 to have a denominator of 120, we get 108/120.
Adding these fractions together, we get 110/120 + 108/120 = 218/120 oz used.

To find out how much magic dust the fairy has left, we subtract the amount used from the original amount she had in the forest:
14/3 oz - 218/120 oz = (560/120 oz) - (218/120 oz) = 342/120 oz.

First, we need to convert 16/10 to have the same denominator as 12, which is 12*5 = 60. So, 16/10 = 96/60.

Now, we can add the amounts of magic dust sprinkled: 11/12 + 96/60.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 60. Converting 11/12 to have a denominator of 60, we get 55/60.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total weight of apples in the store, we need to add the weight of red apples and green apples.
Total weight of apples = 17/20 + 18/8 = (17/20) + (18/8) = (17/20) + (36/20) = 53/20 kg.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total time it takes for the drummer to hit the two beats together with the new rhythm:
Time for the first beat = 16/17 seconds
Time for the second beat = 2/12 seconds = 1/6 seconds

Total time = 16/17 seconds + 1/6 seconds
To add these two times, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 17 and 6 is 102.

Converting 16/17 to have a denominator of 102:
(16/17) * (6/6) = 96/102

Adding the times:
Total time = 96/102 seconds + 17/102 seconds = 113/102 seconds

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many cucumbers Bob has in total, we first need to add the two parts together. 

10/2 of a cucumber is equal to 5 cucumbers.
1/7 of a cucumber is equal to 1/7 cucumber.

Adding these two parts together, we get:
5 + 1/7 = 35/7 + 1/7 = 36/7 = 5 1/7.

So, Bob has a total of 5 1/7 cucumbers.
