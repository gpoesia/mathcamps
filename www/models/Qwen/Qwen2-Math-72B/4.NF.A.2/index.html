(9 / 4) _ (3 / 10)

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To compare the fractions, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 10 is 20. We can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 20:

(3 / 10) = (6 / 20)

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can compare the numerators directly. The numerator of the first fraction is 45, and the numerator of the second fraction is 6. Since 45 is greater than 6, the first fraction is greater than the second fraction.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: From the previous question, we know that (3 / 9) simplifies to (1 / 3). The fraction (8 / 3) is greater than 1 because the numerator is larger than the denominator. Therefore, (1 / 3) &lt; (8 / 3). Changing the denominator in the second fraction from 8 to 3 makes the second fraction larger, which increases the difference between the two fractions.

(3 / 4) _ (6 / 9)

Consider what happens if the second fraction changes, and 6 is divided by 9 instead of 5. How does this change affect the comparison between the two fractions?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's first compare the original fractions (3 / 4) and (6 / 5) as we did before.
(3 / 4) = 0.75
(6 / 5) = 1.2
Since 0.75 &lt; 1.2, we have (3 / 4) &lt; (6 / 5).

Now, let's consider the new fraction (6 / 9). We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.
(6 / 9) = (6 ÷ 3) / (9 ÷ 3) = 2 / 3

Now, let's compare (3 / 4) and (2 / 3) by converting them to decimals.
(3 / 4) = 0.75
(2 / 3) ≈ 0.6667

Since 0.75 &gt; 0.6667, we have (3 / 4) &gt; (2 / 3).

Therefore, changing the second fraction from (6 / 5) to (6 / 9) changes the comparison from (3 / 4) &lt; (6 / 5) to (3 / 4) &gt; (2 / 3).

        Considering the same comparison concept as the previous problem, but this time let's change the fractions. Still filling the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =, answer this question:

(9/6) _ (4/8)

Think about how this change, reducing the number in the numerator of the second fraction, affects the comparison between the two fractions.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To compare the two fractions, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 24:

(9 / 6) = (9 * 4) / (6 * 4) = 36 / 24
(4 / 8) = (4 * 3) / (8 * 3) = 12 / 24

Now, we can compare the two fractions:

36 / 24 &gt; 12 / 24

Therefore, (9 / 6) &gt; (4 / 8).
