        Steve started with 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days. Then he received an extra 11 dollars. John started with 18 dollars but then he spent the same amount of money as Steve had. John found 25 dollars on the street. How much money does John have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Steve spent 38/8 = &lt;&lt;38/8=4.75&gt;&gt;4.75 dollars per day.
John spent 4.75 dollars, so he has 18-4.75 = &lt;&lt;18-4.75=13.25&gt;&gt;13.25 dollars left.
John found 25 dollars, so he has 13.25+25 = &lt;&lt;13.25+25=38.25&gt;&gt;38.25 dollars now.

        Sally wants to measure the distance of her bike route. Initially, she hesitates and travels only 47/50 of a mile. Then, she gains confidence and rides another 31 miles. Every day for the next 28 days, she completes the same distance.

One day, she decided to detour and added an extra 32/24 miles to her regular bike route. How many miles in total did she travel after adding the extra traveling distance?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Sally travels 47/50 + 31 = &lt;&lt;47/50+31=31.94&gt;&gt;31.94 miles on the first day.
For the next 28 days, she travels 31.94 miles each day, so she travels 31.94 * 28 = &lt;&lt;31.94*28=894.32&gt;&gt;894.32 miles in total.
On the day she decided to detour, she traveled an extra 32/24 = &lt;&lt;32/24=1.33&gt;&gt;1.33 miles.
Therefore, she traveled a total of 894.32 + 1.33 = &lt;&lt;894.32+1.33=895.65&gt;&gt;895.65 miles after adding the extra traveling distance.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total distance Jenny ran, we need to add the distance she ran in the first round to the distance she ran in the second round.
First round: 41/32 miles
Second round: 11/4 miles
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 32 and 4 is 32.
First round: 41/32 miles
Second round: (11/4) * (8/8) = 88/32 miles
Total distance: 41/32 + 88/32 = 129/32 miles

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total distance Jenny covered in both her running and cycling exercise, we need to add the distance she ran to the distance she cycled.
Running distance: 129/32 miles
Cycling distance: 15 miles
To add these, we need to convert the cycling distance to a fraction with a denominator of 32.
Cycling distance: 15 * (32/32) = 480/32 miles
Total distance: 129/32 + 480/32 = 609/32 miles

        A scientist mixes 10/42 liters of solution A and 32 liters of solution B to create a mixture. She then removes 4/28 liters from this mixture. If she then decides to extract 11/29 of the remaining mixture for an experiment, how much solution is she using for her experiment?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The scientist mixes 10/42 + 32 = &lt;&lt;10/42+32=32.23809523809524&gt;&gt;32.238 liters of solution.
After removing 4/28 liters, the remaining mixture is 32.238 - 4/28 = &lt;&lt;32.238-4/28=32.142857142857146&gt;&gt;32.143 liters.
The scientist extracts 11/29 of the remaining mixture for her experiment, which is 32.143 * 11/29 = &lt;&lt;32.143*11/29=12.114827586206897&gt;&gt;12.115 liters.

        John bought a drone that can fly 3 kilometers, but when it's carrying a delivery package, it can only fly 50 / 43 kilometers less. When the drone is attached with an additional booster, it can fly an additional 47 / 15 kilometers. How far can the drone fly with the package and the additional booster attached?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The drone can fly 50 / 43 kilometers less when it's carrying a delivery package, which is 50 / 43 = &lt;&lt;50/43=1.1627906976744186&gt;&gt;1.1627906976744186 kilometers less.
So, the drone can fly 3 - 1.1627906976744186 = &lt;&lt;3-1.1627906976744186=1.8372093023255814&gt;&gt;1.8372093023255814 kilometers with the package.

So, the drone can fly 1.8372093023255814 + 3.1333333333333335 = &lt;&lt;1.8372093023255814+3.1333333333333335=4.970542635658915&gt;&gt;4.970542635658915 kilometers with the package and the additional booster attached.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The cargo ship carries 17 / 26 tons of cargo for every one of its 39 containers.
The cargo ship carries 17 / 26 * 39 = &lt;&lt;17/26*39=25.5&gt;&gt;25.5 tons of cargo for all 39 containers.
The cargo ship has an existing cargo load of 50 / 11 tons.
The total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after it loads all 39 containers is 25.5 + 50 / 11 = &lt;&lt;25.5+50/11=30.454545454545453&gt;&gt;30.454545454545453 tons.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

The total amount of juice in the bottle is 22/43 liters.
So, the amount of juice you drink is (9/2) * (22/43) = &lt;&lt;(9/2)*(22/43)=99/43&gt;&gt;99/43 liters.

        Following your juice consumption, you decide to balance it out with some water. You already have 28 liters of water in your jugs. After adding the same amount of juice you consumed, how many total liters of liquid do you now have?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: You add the amount of juice you consumed, which is 99/43 liters, to the 28 liters of water you already have.
To add these two quantities, you need to convert 28 liters to a fraction with a denominator of 43. Since 28 = 28 * 43 / 43, you can write 28 liters as 1204/43 liters.
Adding the two fractions, you get 1204/43 + 99/43 = &lt;&lt;1204/43+99/43=1303/43&gt;&gt;1303/43 liters.

        Originally, you consumed 18/4 of the bottle of juice. Now let's say instead that you consumed only 16/4 of the bottle. In that case, how many liters of juice would you have consumed?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many liters of juice you would have consumed, you need to multiply the fraction of the bottle you drink by the total amount of juice in the bottle.
The fraction of the bottle you drink is 16/4, which simplifies to 4.
The total amount of juice in the bottle is 22/43 liters.
So, the amount of juice you drink is (4) * (22/43) = &lt;&lt;(4)*(22/43)=88/43&gt;&gt;88/43 liters.

        James bought a jug of milk which contains 33/37 gallons. Later, he decided to add more milk into the jug, which was 3/25 gallons. How many gallons of milk does James have in total in the jug?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: James has 33/37 + 3/25 gallons of milk in total.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 37 and 25 is 925.
So, 33/37 = (33*25)/(37*25) = 825/925 and 3/25 = (3*37)/(25*37) = 111/925.
Adding these fractions, we get 825/925 + 111/925 = 936/925 gallons of milk in total.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find the combined volume of milk in one jug after adding the extra milk. From the previous problem, we know that the combined volume is 936/925 gallons.
To find the total amount of milk in 30 jugs, we multiply the combined volume of one jug by 30.
So, the total amount of milk in gallons for all 30 jugs is (936/925) * 30 = 28080/925 gallons.

        You have $15 in your savings account. You decided to spend 17/23 of a dollar on a small sweet. How much is left in your savings account after buying the sweet?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: You have $15 in your savings account.
You spent 17/23 of a dollar on a sweet.
To find out how much you spent, calculate 17/23 of a dollar: 17/23 * 1 = 17/23 dollars.
To find out how much is left in your savings account, subtract the amount spent from the initial amount: $15 - 17/23 = &lt;&lt;15-17/23=343/23&gt;&gt;343/23 dollars.
### Answer: 343/23 dollars
