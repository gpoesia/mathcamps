        Susan has a recipe that calls for 30 parts of flour to 27 parts of water. If she decides to use 29 parts of flour instead, and she keeps the water proportion the same, how much water will she use? Calculate this using fraction multiplication: ((30 / 30) * (29 / 27)).
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The original ratio of flour to water is 30:27. If Susan uses 29 parts of flour, the new ratio of flour to water will be 29:x, where x is the amount of water she will use.
To find x, we can set up a proportion: 30/27 = 29/x
Cross-multiplying gives us: 30x = 27*29
Solving for x gives us: x = (27*29)/30 = &lt;&lt;(27*29)/30=26.1&gt;&gt;26.1

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately.
19/12 * 20/6 = (19 * 20) / (12 * 6) = 380 / 72
To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 380 and 72, which is 4.
380 / 4 = 95
72 / 4 = 18
So, the simplified fraction is 95/18.

420 / 50 = (420 / 10) / (50 / 10) = 42 / 5

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We already calculated that 14/10 * 30/5 = 42/5.
Now, we multiply 42/5 by 13/15.
(42/5) * (13/15) = (42 * 13) / (5 * 15) = 546 / 75
To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.
546 / 75 = (546 / 3) / (75 / 3) = 182 / 25

Next, we divide 26 by 29/14: 26 / (29/14) = 26 * (14/29) = 364/29.

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2128 and 600, which is 8.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we calculate the division: 29 / 16 = &lt;&lt;29/16=1.8125&gt;&gt;1.8125 and 21 / 27 = &lt;&lt;21/27=0.7777777777777778&gt;&gt;0.7777777777777778.
Then, we multiply the results: 1.8125 * 0.7777777777777778 = &lt;&lt;1.8125*0.7777777777777778=1.4074074074074075&gt;&gt;1.4074074074074075.
To express this as a simplified fraction, we convert it to a fraction and simplify: 1.4074074074074075 = &lt;&lt;1.4074074074074075=14074074074074075/10000000000000000&gt;&gt;14074074074074075/10000000000000000.
Simplifying this fraction, we get: 14074074074074075/10000000000000000 = &lt;&lt;14074074074074075/10000000000000000=14074074074074075/10000000000000000&gt;&gt;14074074074074075/10000000000000000.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Earlier, you calculated the result of ((27 / 3) / (12 / 12)) and labeled that answer as 's'. Consider the same scenario, but this time, instead of having 27 items, you only have 24. Calculate the result of (24 / (12 / 12)) and report the answer as a simplified fraction. What effect does this change have on the answer 's'?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses: (12 / 12) = 1.
Then, divide 24 by 1: 24 / 1 = 24.
### Answer: 24
The change in the number of items from 27 to 24 results in a different answer, which is 24 instead of 9.</pre>

(320 / 221) * (20 / 26) = (320 * 20) / (221 * 26) = 6400 / 5746
To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator.
GCD(6400, 5746) = 2
Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD, we get:
6400 / 5746 = (6400 / 2) / (5746 / 2) = 3200 / 2873

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, calculate the fraction (30 / 23) = &lt;&lt;30/23=1.3043478260869565&gt;&gt;1.3043478260869565.
Next, calculate the fraction (19 / 24) = &lt;&lt;19/24=0.7916666666666666&gt;&gt;0.7916666666666666.
Then, multiply the two fractions: 1.3043478260869565 * 0.7916666666666666 = &lt;&lt;1.3043478260869565*0.7916666666666666=1.0309278350515464&gt;&gt;1.0309278350515464.
To convert the decimal to a fraction, we can use the fact that 1.0309278350515464 is approximately equal to 10309278350515464/10000000000000000.
Simplifying the fraction, we get: 10309278350515464/10000000000000000 = &lt;&lt;10309278350515464/10000000000000000=10309278350515464/10000000000000000&gt;&gt;10309278350515464/10000000000000000.

        After solving the previous problem, now evaluate the new expression ((25 / 8) * (29 / 4)). This means we have changed the second fraction from (3 / 4) to (29 / 4).

Under the previous scenario where the fractions referred to sharing or dividing amongst a group, consider what would happen if the proportions you multiplied with were changed to this new ratio. 

Write the result of ((25 / 8) * (29 / 4)) as a simplified fraction and reflect on the impact of this change in the real-world scenario.

### Answer: 725/32

In the real-world scenario, if the proportions you multiplied with were changed from (3 / 4) to (29 / 4), it would mean that each person or group is now receiving a larger portion or share. This could be interpreted as an increase in the amount of resources or items being shared among the group.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately.
(21 / 26) * (20 / 9) = (21 * 20) / (26 * 9) = 420 / 234
To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 420 and 234, which is 6.
420 / 234 = (420 / 6) / (234 / 6) = 70 / 39
Now, we multiply the result by the fraction (15 / 21).
(70 / 39) * (15 / 21) = (70 * 15) / (39 * 21) = 1050 / 819
To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1050 and 819, which is 3.
1050 / 819 = (1050 / 3) / (819 / 3) = 350 / 273

Multiplying 1 by 27/15 gives us 27/15.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Suppose you reevaluate the previous problem but use 22 instead of 28 when you perform the multiplication ((22 / 6) * (16 / 24)). What would be the result this time? Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: (22 / 6) = &lt;&lt;22/6=11/3&gt;&gt;11/3
(16 / 24) = &lt;&lt;16/24=2/3&gt;&gt;2/3
(11/3) * (2/3) = &lt;&lt;(11/3)*(2/3)=22/9&gt;&gt;22/9
### Answer: 22/9
