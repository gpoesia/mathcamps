        Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the second equation by 40/30 to make the coefficients of s the same:

(40/30) * (30 * s) + (40/30) * (12 * q) = (40/30) * 121

This simplifies to:

40 * s + (160/30) * q = (40/30) * 121

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate s:

(40 * s + (160/30) * q) - ((40 * s) - (91 * q)) = (40/30) * 121 - 37

This simplifies to:

(160/30 + 91) * q = (40/30) * 121 - 37

Now, we can solve for q:

q = ((40/30) * 121 - 37) / (160/30 + 91)

Once we have the value of q, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of s.

### Answer: q = &lt;&lt;(40/30) * 121 - 37) / (160/30 + 91)&gt;&gt;, s = &lt;&lt;(40 * q - 37) / 91&gt;&gt;</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 4 to make the coefficients of b the same:
24 * b + 264 * m = 1080
316 * m - 24 * b = 192
Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate b:
264 * m + 316 * m = 1080 + 192
580 * m = 1272
m = 1272 / 580 = &lt;&lt;1272/580=2.19&gt;&gt;2.19
Now, we can substitute the value of m into one of the original equations to solve for b:
4 * b + 44 * 2.19 = 180
4 * b + 96.36 = 180
4 * b = 180 - 96.36 = &lt;&lt;180-96.36=83.64&gt;&gt;83.64
b = 83.64 / 4 = &lt;&lt;83.64/4=20.91&gt;&gt;20.91

        Solve the following system of equations to find the values of o and g: 

42 * o - 15 * g = 28 

47 * o + 29 * g = 141.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 
First, we can solve the first equation for o: 
42 * o = 28 + 15 * g 
o = (28 + 15 * g) / 42 
Next, we can substitute this expression for o into the second equation: 
47 * ((28 + 15 * g) / 42) + 29 * g = 141 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
(47 * 28 + 47 * 15 * g) / 42 + 29 * g = 141 
Multiplying both sides by 42, we get: 
47 * 28 + 47 * 15 * g + 29 * 42 * g = 141 * 42 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
1316 + 705 * g + 1218 * g = 5922 
Combining like terms, we get: 
1923 * g = 4606 
Dividing both sides by 1923, we get: 
g = 4606 / 1923 
g = &lt;&lt;4606/1923=2.4&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;2.4&gt;&gt; 
Substituting this value of g back into the expression for o, we get: 
o = (28 + 15 * 2.4) / 42 
o = (28 + 36) / 42 
o = 64 / 42 
o = &lt;&lt;64/42=1.52&gt;&gt; 
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is o = &lt;&lt;1.52&gt;&gt;1.52 and g = &lt;&lt;2.4&gt;&gt;2.4.

        Given the following system of equations, determine the values of v and o: 
The first equation is: ((12 * v) - (6 * o)) = 21
The second equation is:  ((76 * v) - (45 * o)) = 50.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Multiply the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 12 to eliminate v:
(76 * ((12 * v) - (6 * o))) = 76 * 21
(12 * ((76 * v) - (45 * o))) = 12 * 50
This simplifies to:
(912 * v) - (456 * o) = 1596
(912 * v) - (540 * o) = 600
Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate v:
(912 * v) - (456 * o) - ((912 * v) - (540 * o)) = 1596 - 600
This simplifies to:
84 * o = 996
Divide both sides by 84 to solve for o:
o = &lt;&lt;84/996=12&gt;&gt;12
Substitute o = 12 into the first equation to solve for v:
((12 * v) - (6 * 12)) = 21
(12 * v) - 72 = 21
Add 72 to both sides:
(12 * v) = 93
Divide both sides by 12 to solve for v:
v = &lt;&lt;93/12=7.75&gt;&gt;7.75

4 * (7 = 65 * n - 79 * y) =&gt; 28 = 260 * n - 316 * y
Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate y:

From the second equation, we can express l in terms of g: l = (6 + 53 * g) / 41.
Substituting this expression for l into the first equation, we get: 146 = 28 * g + 26 * ((6 + 53 * g) / 41).

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 56 to make the coefficients of y the same:

1) 140 * p + 392 * y = 630
2) 4876 * p + 392 * y = 5488

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate y:

4876 * p - 140 * p = 5488 - 630
4736 * p = 4858

Now, we can solve for p:

p = 4858 / 4736
p = &lt;&lt;4858/4736=1.0258&gt;&gt;1.0258

Now that we have the value of p, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's use the first equation:

20 * 1.0258 + 56 * y = 90
20.516 + 56 * y = 90
56 * y = 90 - 20.516
56 * y = 69.484

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 69.484 / 56
y = &lt;&lt;69.484/56=1.2404&gt;&gt;1.2404

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is p = 1.0258 and y = 1.2404.

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate k: 756*d + 759*k - (72*k - 22*d) = 1056 - 17, which simplifies to 734*d = 1039.

From equation 1, we can express q in terms of e: q = (29 + 44 * e) / 43.
Substituting this expression for q in equation 2, we get: 30 * ((29 + 44 * e) / 43) + 43 * e = 130.
Simplifying this equation, we get: 290 + 1320 * e + 1809 * e = 5590.

        Find the values of r and a in the following system of equations:

    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.
From the first equation, we can express r in terms of a: r = (53 + 74 * a) / 89.
Substituting this expression for r in the second equation, we get: 109 = ((37 * a) + (6 * ((53 + 74 * a) / 89))).
Simplifying this equation, we get: 109 = (37 * a) + (6 * (53 + 74 * a) / 89).
Multiplying both sides by 89, we get: 9681 = (37 * a) * 89 + (6 * (53 + 74 * a)).
Expanding and simplifying, we get: 9681 = 3293 * a + 318 + 444 * a.
Combining like terms, we get: 9681 = 3737 * a + 318.
Subtracting 318 from both sides, we get: 9363 = 3737 * a.
Dividing both sides by 3737, we get: a = 9363 / 3737 = &lt;&lt;9363/3737=2.504&gt;&gt;2.504.
Substituting this value of a back into the expression for r, we get: r = (53 + 74 * 2.504) / 89 = &lt;&lt;(53 + 74 * 2.504) / 89=2.504&gt;&gt;2.504.

        Given the following pair of equations where 'g' and 'q' represent the quantities of two different types of grains in a mix, solve for 'g' and 'q':

1. The sum of the weights of 42 units of 'g' and 12 units of 'q' equals 169 kg.
2. The weight of 12 units of 'q' minus the weight of 50 units of 'g' results in 19 kg.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

From the first equation, we have:
42g + 12q = 169

From the second equation, we have:
12q - 50g = 19

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Multiply the second equation by 42/50 to align the coefficients of 'g':
(42/50) * (12q - 50g) = (42/50) * 19
(42/50) * 12q - (42/50) * 50g = (42/50) * 19
(252/50)q - 42g = (798/50)

Now, add this to the first equation to eliminate 'g':
42g + 12q + (252/50)q - 42g = 169 + (798/50)
12q + (252/50)q = 169 + (798/50)
(600/50)q + (252/50)q = (8450/50) + (798/50)
(852/50)q = (9248/50)
q = (9248/50) / (852/50)
q = 9248 / 852
q = &lt;&lt;9248/852=10.84&gt;&gt;10.84

Now, substitute the value of 'q' back into one of the original equations to solve for 'g':
42g + 12 * 10.84 = 169
42g + 129.68 = 169
42g = 169 - 129.68
42g = 39.32
g = 39.32 / 42
g = &lt;&lt;39.32/42=0.936&gt;&gt;0.936

37 * s - 11 * v = 54

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the method of elimination.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of s the same:

74 * s - 22 * v = 108

Now, we can subtract the second equation from this new equation to eliminate s:

(74 * s - 22 * v) - (82 * s - 62 * v) = 108 - 41

This simplifies to:

-8 * s + 40 * v = 67

Now, we can solve for v:

v = (67 + 8 * s) / 40

Substituting this expression for v into the first equation, we get:

37 * s - 11 * ((67 + 8 * s) / 40) = 54

Solving this equation for s, we get:

s = &lt;&lt;37 * s - 11 * ((67 + 8 * s) / 40) = 54|solve for s|&gt;&gt;1.5

Substituting this value of s back into the expression for v, we get:

v = (67 + 8 * 1.5) / 40 = &lt;&lt;(67 + 8 * 1.5) / 40|calculate v|&gt;&gt;2.5

Subtract the second equation from the first:

Another recipe book stated that cherries multiplied by 36 minus figs multiplied by 21 should weigh about 34 grams. Can you find the quantity of cherries (c) and figs (f)?

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We have two equations:
(75 * a) - (4 * i) = 42
(10 * i) + (13 * a) = 160
We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination method.
Let's use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 10 and the second equation by 75 to make the coefficients of a equal:
(750 * a) - (40 * i) = 420
(750 * i) + (975 * a) = 12000
Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate a:
(750 * a) - (40 * i) + (750 * i) + (975 * a) = 420 + 12000
(1725 * a) + (710 * i) = 12420
Now, we can solve for i:
i = (12420 - 1725 * a) / 710
Substituting this expression for i into the first equation, we get:
(75 * a) - (4 * ((12420 - 1725 * a) / 710)) = 42
Solving for a, we get:
a = 2
Substituting a = 2 into the expression for i, we get:
i = (12420 - 1725 * 2) / 710
i = 16

37 * p + 74 * c = 183

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 27 and the second equation by 37 to make the coefficients of p equal:

1009 * p + 2028 * c = 4941
999 * c - 666 * p = 481

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate p:

1009 * p + 2028 * c + 999 * c - 666 * p = 4941 + 481
1375 * c = 5422

Now, we can solve for c:

c = 5422 / 1375
c = &lt;&lt;5422/1375=3.94&gt;&gt;3.94

Next, we can substitute the value of c back into one of the original equations to solve for p:

37 * p + 74 * 3.94 = 183
37 * p + 290.76 = 183
37 * p = 183 - 290.76
37 * p = -107.76

Now, we can solve for p:

p = -107.76 / 37
p = &lt;&lt;-107.76/37=-2.91&gt;&gt;-2.91

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is p = -2.91 and c = 3.94.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 53 and the second equation by 69 to make the coefficients of v the same:

1. 3975v - 3657f = 742
2. 3174f + 3657v = 7590

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate v:

3174f + 3657v - (3975v - 3657f) = 7590 - 742
3174f + 3657v - 3975v + 3657f = 6848
6831f = 6848
f = 6848/6831
f = &lt;&lt;6848/6831=0.999854&gt;&gt;0.999854

Now, we can substitute the value of f into one of the original equations to find the value of v:

75v - 69(0.999854) = 14
75v - 68.9879 = 14
75v = 82.9879
v = 82.9879/75
v = &lt;&lt;82.9879/75=1.106505&gt;&gt;1.106505

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

Simplifying, we get: 
89 * g - 10 * (131 - 13 * g) = 37.
Expanding and simplifying, we get: 
89 * g - 1310 + 130 * g = 37.
Combining like terms, we get:

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate k:
1980 * k - 660 * d - (88 * d - 60 * k) = 2760 - 38
1920 * k - 748 * d = 2722
Now, we can solve for d:
d = (2722 - 1920 * k) / 748
Substituting this expression for d into the first equation, we can solve for k:
88 * ((2722 - 1920 * k) / 748) - 60 * k = 38

To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 52 and the second equation by 55 to make the coefficients of 'r' in both equations equal:

1) 2184 * m + 2860 * r = 6604 
2) 3630 * m - 2860 * r = 2420 

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate 'r':

Dividing both sides by 5814, we get:

Substituting the value of 'm' in the first equation, we get:

Solving for 'r', we get:

Now, we can solve for u:

u = 10696 / 7406 = &lt;&lt;10696/7406=1.44&gt;&gt;1.44

Substituting u = 1.44 into equation 1, we can solve for a:

72 * a + 26 * 1.44 = 112

72 * a + 37.44 = 112

72 * a = 112 - 37.44

72 * a = 74.56

a = 74.56 / 72 = &lt;&lt;74.56/72=1.03&gt;&gt;1.03

First, we can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of b the same:
162n + 54b = 429
174n - 186b = 96
Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate b:
336n = 525
n = 525/336 = &lt;&lt;525/336=1.5625&gt;&gt;

What are the costs of electricity (e) and petroleum (p)?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 88 and the second equation by 7 to make the coefficients of p the same:

4664 * e + 616 * p = 8804
483 * e - 616 * p = 42

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate p:

4664 * e + 483 * e = 8804 + 42
5147 * e = 8846

Now, we can solve for e:

e = 8846 / 5147
e = &lt;&lt;8846/5147=1.72&gt;&gt;1.72

Now that we have the value of e, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of p. Let's use the first equation:

53 * 1.72 + 7 * p = 103
91.84 + 7 * p = 103
7 * p = 103 - 91.84
7 * p = 11.16

Now, we can solve for p:

p = 11.16 / 7
p = &lt;&lt;11.16/7=1.59&gt;&gt;1.59

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of linear equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 24 and the second equation by 7 to make the coefficients of p the same:

(24 * ((18 * p) - (7 * s))) = 24 * 21
(7 * ((51 * s) - (24 * p))) = 7 * 14

This gives us:

(432 * p) - (168 * s) = 504
(357 * s) - (168 * p) = 98

Now, we can add these two equations to eliminate p:

(432 * p) - (168 * s) + (357 * s) - (168 * p) = 504 + 98

This simplifies to:

(264 * p) + (189 * s) = 602

Now, we can solve for s:

s = (602 - (264 * p)) / 189

Substituting this expression for s into the first equation, we get:

(18 * p) - (7 * ((602 - (264 * p)) / 189)) = 21

Solving this equation for p, we get:

p = &lt;&lt;(21 + (7 * (602 / 189))) / (18 - (7 * (264 / 189)))&gt;&gt;1.5

Substituting this value of p back into the expression for s, we get:

s = (602 - (264 * 1.5)) / 189

s = &lt;&lt;(602 - (264 * 1.5)) / 189&gt;&gt;1.5

Therefore, the values of p and s that satisfy both equations are:

p = 1.5
s = 1.5

First, we can multiply the first equation by 11 and the second equation by 59 to make the coefficients of c the same:
59*11c - 34*11w = 84*11
59*59c + 42*59w = 98*59
Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate c:
(59*11c - 34*11w) + (59*59c + 42*59w) = 84*11 + 98*59
59*11c + 59*59c = 84*11 + 98*59
59*(11c + 59c) = 84*11 + 98*59
59*70c = 84*11 + 98*59
Now, we can solve for c:
c = (84*11 + 98*59) / (59*70)
c = (924 + 5782) / 4130
c = 6706 / 4130
c = &lt;&lt;6706/4130=1.624&gt;&gt;1.624

Next, we can substitute this expression for f into the second equation: 60 * z - 42 * ((101 - 42 * z) / 45) = 13.
Simplifying this equation, we get: 60 * z - (42 * 101 - 42 * 42 * z) / 45 = 13.
Multiplying both sides by 45, we get: 2700 * z - 42 * 101 + 42 * 42 * z = 585.
Combining like terms, we get: 1146 * z = 1015.
Dividing both sides by 1146, we get: z = 1015 / 1146.
Substituting this value of z back into the expression for f, we get: f = (101 - 42 * (1015 / 1146)) / 45.
Simplifying this expression, we get: f = (101 - 42 * 1015 / 1146) / 45.

Now, we can solve for p: p = (1705 + 7 * q) / 130.
Substituting this expression for p into the second equation, we get: 6 * q + 5 * ((1705 + 7 * q) / 130) = 177.
Solving this equation for q, we get q = &lt;&lt;67q-80p=65; 6q+5p=177; q=(1705+7q)/130; 6q+5((1705+7q)/130)=177; q=13; p=11&gt;&gt;13.
Substituting this value of q into the expression for p, we get p = &lt;&lt;67q-80p=65; 6q+5p=177; q=(1705+7q)/130; 6q+5((1705+7q)/130)=177; q=13; p=11&gt;&gt;11.
### Answer: p = &lt;&lt;67q-80p=65; 6q+5p=177; q=(1705+7q)/130; 6q+5((1705+7q)/130)=177; q=13; p=11&gt;&gt;11, q = &lt;&lt;67q-80p=65; 6q+5p=177; q=(1705+7q)/130; 6q+5((1705+7q)/130)=177; q=13; p=11&gt;&gt;13

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 41 and the second equation by 48 to make the coefficients of f equal:
410 * k + 1968 * f = 6601
1584 * k - 1968 * f = 1488
Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate f:
410 * k + 1584 * k = 6601 + 1488
1994 * k = 8089
k = 8089 / 1994
k = &lt;&lt;8089/1994=4.05&gt;&gt;4.05
Now, we can substitute the value of k into one of the original equations to find f:
10 * 4.05 + 48 * f = 161
40.5 + 48 * f = 161
48 * f = 161 - 40.5
48 * f = 120.5
f = 120.5 / 48

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 
From the first equation, we can express n in terms of l: n = 58 * l - 31.
Substituting this expression for n into the second equation, we get: 103 = (58 * l - 31) + 73 * l.
Simplifying this equation, we get: 103 = 131 * l - 31.
Adding 31 to both sides, we get: 134 = 131 * l.
Dividing both sides by 131, we get: l = 134 / 131 = &lt;&lt;134/131=1.0225563909774431&gt;&gt;1.0225563909774431.
Substituting this value of l back into the expression for n, we get: n = 58 * 1.0225563909774431 - 31 = &lt;&lt;58*1.0225563909774431-31=27.288000000000002&gt;&gt;27.288000000000002.

725y + 1073j = 3364

Next, we can subtract the first new equation from the second new equation to eliminate y:

29y - 37.688 = 39
29y = 76.688

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 23 and the second equation by 61 to make the coefficients of g the same:

23 * (97 * u - 61 * g) = 23 * 15
61 * (85 * u + 23 * g) = 61 * 186

This gives us:

2231 * u - 1403 * g = 345
5185 * u + 1403 * g = 11346

Now, we can add these two equations to eliminate g:

2231 * u + 5185 * u = 345 + 11346
7416 * u = 11691

Now, we can solve for u:

u = 11691 / 7416
u = &lt;&lt;11691/7416=1.57&gt;&gt;1.57

Now that we have the value of u, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of g. Let's use the first equation:

97 * 1.57 - 61 * g = 15

Now, we can solve for g:

151.29 - 61 * g = 15
-61 * g = 15 - 151.29
-61 * g = -136.29

Now, we can solve for g:

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate n:

(2550 * n) - (1620 * t) + (2052 * t) + (1530 * n) = 1230 + 6804

This simplifies to:

Now, we can solve for t:

t = (4080 * n - 8034) / 568

Substituting this expression for t back into one of the original equations, we can solve for n:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 94 and the second equation by 68 to make the coefficients of u the same:
7672w + 6368u = 15980,
4828w - 6368u = 544.
Adding these two equations, we get:
12500w = 16524.
Dividing both sides by 12500, we get:
w = &lt;&lt;16524/12500=1.32192&gt;&gt;1.32192.
Substituting this value of w into the first equation, we get:
8(1.32192) + 68u = 170.

        Given the equations below, find the values of r and d:

For the first equation, consider 67 apples, each worth d dollars, and 37 ragdolls, each worth r dollars. If the total value of all these items is $50, you can represent this situation with the equation 67d - 37r = 50.

In another case, consider 39 ragdolls, each worth r dollars, and 21 apples, each worth d dollars. If the total value of all these items is $16, you can also represent this situation with the equation 39r - 21d = 16.

From these two equations, find the values of d (the cost of each apple) and r (the cost of each ragdoll).

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We have two equations:

67d - 37r = 50
39r - 21d = 16

To solve for d and r, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 21 and the second equation by 67 to make the coefficients of d the same:

1407d - 777r = 1050
2553r - 1407d = 1072

Now, we can add these two equations to eliminate d:

1407d - 777r + 2553r - 1407d = 1050 + 1072
1776r = 2122

Now, we can solve for r:

r = 2122 / 1776
r = &lt;&lt;2122/1776=1.2}}1.2

Now that we have the value of r, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of d. Let's use the first equation:

67d - 37(1.2) = 50
67d - 44.4 = 50
67d = 94.4
d = 94.4 / 67
d = &lt;&lt;94.4/67=1.4}}1.4

        To find the values of x and a, solve the following system of simultaneous linear equations: 

First equation: 163 equals 50 times x plus a
Second equation: 24 equals 98 times x minus 84 times a.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 
First, we can simplify the first equation to 163 = 50x + a.
Then, we can simplify the second equation to 24 = 98x - 84a.
Next, we can solve for a in the first equation: a = 163 - 50x.
Substituting this expression for a into the second equation, we get 24 = 98x - 84(163 - 50x).
Simplifying this equation, we get 24 = 98x - 13752 + 4200x.
Combining like terms, we get 4298x = 13776.
Dividing both sides by 4298, we get x = &lt;&lt;4298/13776=0.3125&gt;&gt;0.3125.
Substituting this value of x back into the expression for a, we get a = 163 - 50(0.3125) = &lt;&lt;163-50*0.3125=140&gt;&gt;140.

(33/24)*24*a - (33/24)*26*c = (33/24)*29

Simplifying the second equation, we get:

First, we can multiply the first equation by 61 and the second equation by 46 to eliminate s:

2886 * s - 3721 * w = 122 
2886 * s + 3062 * w = 8188.
Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

6783 * w = 8066.
Dividing both sides by 6783, we get:

w = &lt;&lt;8066/6783=1.19&gt;&gt;1.19.
Substituting this value of w into the first equation, we get:

46 * s - 61 * 1.19 = 2.

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate 'f':

2. 3465m - 110s = 5390

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate s:

m = &lt;&lt;5389/3381=1.6000&gt;&gt;1.6000

Next, we can substitute the value of m back into one of the original equations to solve for s. Let's use the first equation:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 4 to make the coefficients of c the same:

20 * c + 112 * p = 408

Now, we can subtract the second equation from this new equation:

(20 * c + 112 * p) - (20 * c - 67 * p) = 408 - 13

This simplifies to:

179 * p = 395

Now, we can solve for p:

p = 395 / 179

Next, we can substitute this value of p back into one of the original equations to solve for c. Let's use the first equation:

5 * c + 28 * (395 / 179) = 102

This simplifies to:

5 * c + 56 = 102

Now, we can solve for c:

5 * c = 102 - 56

5 * c = 46

c = 46 / 5

        You are given the following system of equations:
The result of 89 multiplied by p minus 41 multiplied by q equals 60.
The result of 27 multiplied by p plus 91 multiplied by q equals 124.
What are the values of p and q?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 27 and the second equation by 89 to make the coefficients of p the same:
27(89p - 41q) = 27(60)
89(27p + 91q) = 89(124)
This gives us:
2403p - 1107q = 1620
2403p + 8099q = 11036
Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate p:
(2403p + 8099q) - (2403p - 1107q) = 11036 - 1620
This simplifies to:
9206q = 9416
Now, we can solve for q:
q = 9416 / 9206
q = &lt;&lt;9416/9206=1.022&gt;&gt;1.022
Now that we have the value of q, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for p. Let's use the first equation:
89p - 41(1.022) = 60
89p - 42.002 = 60
89p = 102.002
p = 102.002 / 89
p = &lt;&lt;102.002/89=1.146&gt;&gt;1.146
Therefore, the values of p and q are p = &lt;&lt;1.146&gt;&gt;1.146 and q = &lt;&lt;1.022&gt;&gt;1.022.
### Answer: p = 1.146, q = 1.022</pre>

        Find the values of u and d that make these equations true: 

The first equation is: (88 * u) - (96 * d) = 12 

The second equation is: (27 * u) + (36 * d) = 71
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 
First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing both sides by 8: 
11u - 12d = 1.5
Next, we can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 9: 
3u + 4d = 7.89
Now we have a system of two equations with two variables: 
11u - 12d = 1.5
3u + 4d = 7.89
We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. 
Using the substitution method, we can solve the second equation for u: 
u = (7.89 - 4d) / 3
Substituting this expression for u into the first equation, we get: 
11((7.89 - 4d) / 3) - 12d = 1.5
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
26.37 - 44d - 36d = 4.5
Combining like terms, we get: 
-80d = -21.87
Dividing both sides by -80, we get: 
d = 0.273375
Substituting this value of d back into the expression for u, we get: 
u = (7.89 - 4(0.273375)) / 3
Simplifying this expression, we get: 
u = 2.23
Therefore, the values of u and d that make these equations true are: 
u = 2.23
d = 0.273375
### Answer: u = 2.23, d = 0.273375

Solving this equation for f, we find that f = &lt;&lt;20 * ((70 + 2f) / 3) - 18 * f = 9; f = 10&gt;&gt;10.

11(66u - 68w) = 11(21)

2640 * y + 616 * z = 5056.
Next, we can add the two equations to eliminate z:

Now, we can solve for y:

Substituting this expression for y into the first equation, we get:

58 * (69 * h + 11 * t) = 58 * 124

This gives us:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.
From the first equation, we can express h in terms of o: h = (9 + 61 * o) / 79.
Substituting this expression for h into the second equation, we get: ((16 * ((9 + 61 * o) / 79)) - (12 * o)) = 9.
Solving this equation for o, we get: o = &lt;&lt;(16 * ((9 + 61 * o) / 79)) - (12 * o) = 9, solve for o&gt;&gt;.
Substituting the value of o back into the expression for h, we get: h = &lt;&lt;(9 + 61 * o) / 79&gt;&gt;.
### Answer: o = &lt;&lt;(16 * ((9 + 61 * o) / 79)) - (12 * o) = 9, solve for o&gt;&gt;, h = &lt;&lt;(9 + 61 * o) / 79&gt;&gt;</pre>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 45 and the second equation by 4 to make the coefficients of z the same:

1890 * d - 180 * z = 3375
160 * d + 180 * z = 648

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate z:

1890 * d + 160 * d = 3375 + 648
2050 * d = 4023

Now, we can solve for d:

d = 4023 / 2050
d = &lt;&lt;4023/2050=2.001&gt;&gt;2.001

Now, we can substitute the value of d back into one of the original equations to find z:

42 * 2.001 - 4 * z = 75
84.042 - 4 * z = 75
-4 * z = 75 - 84.042
-4 * z = -9.042

Now, we can solve for z:

z = -9.042 / -4
z = &lt;&lt;-9.042/-4=2.2605&gt;&gt;2.2605

Let's use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the second equation by 4 to make the coefficients of 'o' the same:
(42 * a) + (6 * o) = 75
(168 * a) + (24 * o) = 300
Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation:
(168 * a) + (24 * o) - (42 * o) - (24 * a) = 300 - 142
(144 * a) + (24 * o) = 158
Now, we can solve for 'a':
a = (158 - 24 * o) / 144
Substitute this value of 'a' into the first equation:
(42 * o) + (24 * ((158 - 24 * o) / 144)) = 142
Solving this equation will give us the value of 'o', and then we can substitute this value back into the equation for 'a' to find its value.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.
From the first equation, we can express p in terms of r: p = &lt;&lt;39*r-45/2&gt;&gt;(39*r-45)/2.
Substituting this expression for p into the second equation, we get: 16*(39*r-45)/2 - 84*r = 36.
Simplifying this equation, we get: 312*r - 360 - 84*r = 36.
Combining like terms, we get: 228*r = 396.
Dividing both sides by 228, we get: r = &lt;&lt;396/228&gt;&gt;1.7368421052631579.
Substituting this value of r back into the expression for p, we get: p = &lt;&lt;39*1.7368421052631579-45/2&gt;&gt;(39*1.7368421052631579-45)/2.

        Given the following system of equations, solve for the values of 'd' and 'w':

1. (23 * d) - (52 * w) = 7
2. (64 * w) - (8 * d) = 58
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve for 'd' and 'w', we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 8 and the second equation by 52 to make the coefficients of 'd' the same:

1. (184 * d) - (416 * w) = 56
2. (3328 * w) - (416 * d) = 3016

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate 'd':

(184 * d) - (416 * w) + (3328 * w) - (416 * d) = 56 + 3016

This simplifies to:

(184 * d) - (416 * d) + (3328 * w) - (416 * w) = 3072

Which further simplifies to:

(184 - 416) * d + (3328 - 416) * w = 3072

-232 * d + 2912 * w = 3072

Now, we can solve for 'w':

w = (3072 + 232 * d) / 2912

Substituting this value of 'w' into the first equation, we can solve for 'd':

(23 * d) - (52 * ((3072 + 232 * d) / 2912)) = 7

Solving this equation will give us the value of 'd', and substituting this value back into the equation for 'w' will give us the value of 'w'.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 47 and the second equation by 60 to make the coefficients of n the same:

(47 * 71 * z) + (47 * 60 * n) = 47 * 184 
(60 * 52 * z) - (60 * 47 * n) = 60 * 19.

This gives us:

(3337 * z) + (2820 * n) = 8648 
(3120 * z) - (2820 * n) = 1140.

Next, we can add the two equations together to eliminate n:

(3337 * z) + (3120 * z) = 8648 + 1140.

This simplifies to:

6457 * z = 9788.

Dividing both sides by 6457 gives us:

z = &lt;&lt;9788/6457=1.515&gt;&gt;1.515.

Substituting this value of z back into one of the original equations, we can solve for n:

(71 * 1.515) + (60 * n) = 184.

This simplifies to:

107.715 + 60 * n = 184.

Subtracting 107.715 from both sides gives us:

60 * n = 76.285.

Dividing both sides by 60 gives us:

n = &lt;&lt;76.285/60=1.271&gt;&gt;1.271.

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the second equation by 89 to make the coefficients of f the same:
(89 * 3 * f) + (89 * 10 * s) = 89 * 93
267f + 890s = 8277
Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate f:
(267f + 890s) - ((71 * s) - (89 * f)) = 8277 - 5
267f + 890s - 71s + 89f = 8272
356f + 819s = 8272
Now, we can solve for s:
819s = 8272 - 356f
s = (8272 - 356f) / 819
Now, we can substitute this expression for s into the second equation:
(3 * f) + (10 * ((8272 - 356f) / 819)) = 93
3f + (82720 - 3560f) / 819 = 93
(2457f + 82720 - 3560f) / 819 = 93
(82720 - 1103f) / 819 = 93
82720 - 1103f = 93 * 819
82720 - 1103f = 76237
-1103f = 76237 - 82720
-1103f = -6483
f = -6483 / -1103
f = 5.88
Now, we can substitute this value of f back into the expression for s:
s = (8272 - 356 * 5.88) / 819
s = (8272 - 2092.48) / 819
s = 6179.52 / 819
