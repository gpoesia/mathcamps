    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's denote the strength of Green Gauntlet as G. According to the problem, Jetstream has 5 times the strength of Green Gauntlet, so Jetstream's strength is 5G.
Since Green Gauntlet can multiply his strength by a factor of 3, his strength becomes 3G.
Therefore, Jetstream's strength is 5 times the strength of Green Gauntlet, which is 5 * 3G = &lt;&lt;5*3=15&gt;&gt;15G.
