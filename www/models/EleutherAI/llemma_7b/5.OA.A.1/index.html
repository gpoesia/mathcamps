        A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 2840/40 = &lt;&lt;2840/40=71&gt;&gt;71 packs of socks will be needed to package all the socks.
The company has 93+71 = &lt;&lt;93+71=164&gt;&gt;164 packs of socks now.
The company returned 8 packs of socks due to quality issues.
The company has 164-8 = &lt;&lt;164-8=156&gt;&gt;156 packs of socks now.

        At the end of a rainbow, a leprechaun is guarding a pot of gold coins. He adds 39 gold coins to the pot, then another 47. However, while he is distracted, a fairy takes away 8 gold coins from the pot. The new total of coins becomes a code to a magical lock. The code must be enhanced by adding 48 to it only once, and then multiplied by 24. What is the final value to unlock the magical lock?

        If each pair of binoculars costs $27 and a store adds a tax of $9 after buying 23 pairs, how much will the total cost be?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total cost of the binoculars is 23*27 = &lt;&lt;23*27=621&gt;&gt;621.
The store adds a tax of 9*23 = &lt;&lt;9*23=207&gt;&gt;207.
The total cost is 621+207 = &lt;&lt;621+207=828&gt;&gt;828.
