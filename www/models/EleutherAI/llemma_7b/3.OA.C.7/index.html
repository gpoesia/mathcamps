        On a slide, for each 1 meter of sliding, Isaac gains 3 times the speed. If Isaac slides down 1 meter, how much speed does he gain?

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Isaac gains 3 times the speed for each 1 meter of sliding.
If Isaac slides down 1 meter, he gains 3 times the speed for each 1 meter of sliding.
3 times the speed for each 1 meter of sliding is 3 times 1 = &lt;&lt;3*1=3&gt;&gt;3 times 1 = 3.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Isaac gains 5 times the speed for each 1 meter of sliding.
If Isaac slides down 1 meter, he gains 5 times the speed for each 1 meter of sliding.
5 times the speed for each 1 meter of sliding is 5 times 1 = &lt;&lt;5*1=5&gt;&gt;5 times 1 = 5.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The penguin's height is 4 times the depth it reaches.
Let the penguin's height be h.
Let the depth the penguin reaches be d.
The penguin's height is 4 times the depth it reaches.
h = 4d
The penguin takes 28 seconds to reach the depth.
28 = d/h
28 = d/(4d)
28 = 1/4d
d = 28*4
d = 112
The square of the depth the penguin reaches in seconds is &lt;&lt;d^2=112^2=12544&gt;&gt;12544.
