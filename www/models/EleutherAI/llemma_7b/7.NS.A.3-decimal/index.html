        A giraffe eats 22.3 pounds of leaves in the morning and 6.1 pounds later in the afternoon. If 7.58 pounds of the eaten leaves were not digested, how many pounds were digested?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 22.3 + 6.1 = &lt;&lt;22.3+6.1=28.4&gt;&gt;28.4 pounds of leaves were eaten.
7.58 + 28.4 = &lt;&lt;7.58+28.4=35.98&gt;&gt;35.98 pounds of leaves were digested.
