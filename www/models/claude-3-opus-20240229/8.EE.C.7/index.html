    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation 122 = 92 + 28 * u for the variable u, we need to isolate u on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 92 from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by 28.

Step 1: Subtract 92 from both sides of the equation.
122 - 92 = 92 - 92 + 28 * u
30 = 28 * u

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 28.
30 ÷ 28 = 28 * u ÷ 28
30/28 = u
&lt;&lt;30/28=1.0714285714285714&gt;&gt;1.0714285714285714 = u

Step 1: Add 34 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing i.
42 + 34 = ((35 * i) - 34) + 34
76 = 35 * i

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 35 to solve for i.
76 ÷ 35 = (35 * i) ÷ 35
76/35 = i

Now, simplify the fraction 76/35:

Step 1: Subtract 26 from both sides of the equation.
92 - 26 = 33 * t + 26 - 26
66 = 33 * t

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 33.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation 77 = (33 + (14 * x)), we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation.

Step 1: Simplify the right side of the equation by removing the parentheses.
77 = 33 + 14x

Step 2: Subtract 33 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing x.
77 - 33 = 33 - 33 + 14x
44 = 14x

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for x.
44 ÷ 14 = 14x ÷ 14
x = 44 ÷ 14
x = 3.142857...

Since the question asks for the value of x, we can round the answer to a reasonable number of decimal places, such as 3.14 or 3.143.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation 110 = 12 + 88 * y for y, we need to isolate y on one side of the equation.

Step 1: Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing y.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation 179 = 82 * s + 80 for the variable 's', we need to isolate 's' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 80 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the right side. Then, we'll divide both sides by 82 to isolate 's'.

Step 1: Subtract 80 from both sides of the equation.
179 - 80 = 82 * s + 80 - 80
99 = 82 * s

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 82.
99 ÷ 82 = 82 * s ÷ 82
99 ÷ 82 = s

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation 147 = 36 * o + 74 for o, we need to isolate the variable o on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 74 from both sides of the equation and then dividing both sides by 36.

Step 1: Subtract 74 from both sides of the equation.
147 - 74 = 36 * o + 74 - 74
73 = 36 * o

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 36.
73 ÷ 36 = 36 * o ÷ 36
73 ÷ 36 = o

Now, we need to perform the division 73 ÷ 36.
73 ÷ 36 = 2 remainder 1
1 ÷ 36 = 1/36

Therefore, 73 ÷ 36 = 2 + 1/36 = 2 1/36 (or 2.027777... as a decimal).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation 71 = 93 - (13 * d), we need to isolate the variable d on one side of the equation.

Step 1: Simplify the right side of the equation by distributing the negative sign.
71 = 93 - 13d

Step 2: Subtract 93 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing d on the right side.
71 - 93 = 93 - 93 - 13d
-22 = -13d

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by -13 to solve for d.
-22 ÷ (-13) = -13d ÷ (-13)
&lt;&lt;-22/-13=1.6923076923076923&gt;&gt;1.6923076923076923 = d

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation 96 = ((29 * f) + 10) for the value of f, we need to isolate the variable f on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations on both sides of the equation.

Step 1: Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing f.
96 - 10 = ((29 * f) + 10) - 10
86 = 29 * f

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 29 to solve for f.
86 ÷ 29 = (29 * f) ÷ 29
86 ÷ 29 = f
&lt;&lt;86/29=2.9655172413793105&gt;&gt;2.9655172413793105 = f

Therefore, the value of f that satisfies the equation 96 = ((29 * f) + 10) is approximately 2.9655172413793105.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation 80 = (19 + (14 * q)) for the variable q, we need to isolate q on one side of the equation. We can do this by using inverse operations to undo the operations performed on q.

Given:
80 = (19 + (14 * q))

Step 1: Simplify the right side of the equation by removing the parentheses.
80 = 19 + 14q

Step 2: Subtract 19 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing q.
80 - 19 = 19 - 19 + 14q
61 = 14q

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for q.
61 ÷ 14 = 14q ÷ 14
&lt;&lt;61/14=4.357142857142857&gt;&gt;4.357142857142857 = q

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation 122 = (36 + (56 * c)) for c, we need to isolate the variable c on one side of the equation. We can do this by using inverse operations.

Given:
122 = (36 + (56 * c))

Step 1: Simplify the right side of the equation by removing the parentheses.
122 = 36 + 56c

Step 2: Subtract 36 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing c.
122 - 36 = 36 - 36 + 56c
86 = 56c

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 56 to solve for c.
86 ÷ 56 = 56c ÷ 56
c = 86 ÷ 56
c = 43 ÷ 28 (simplified fraction)
c = 1.5357... (decimal form)

103 = (52 + 6j)

Step 2: Subtract 52 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing j.

60 ÷ 6 = (6 * g) ÷ 6
10 = g

Therefore, the solution to the linear equation 79 = ((6 * g) + 19) is g = 10.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation 145 = (50 + (91 * g)) for the variable g, we need to isolate g on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations on both sides of the equation.

Step 1: Subtract 50 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing g.
145 - 50 = (50 + (91 * g)) - 50
95 = 91 * g

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 91 to solve for g.
95 ÷ 91 = (91 * g) ÷ 91
95/91 = g

Therefore, the solution to the linear equation 145 = (50 + (91 * g)) is:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation 123 = ((44 * l) + 73) for the value of l, we need to isolate the variable l on one side of the equation.

Step 1: Subtract 73 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing l.
123 - 73 = ((44 * l) + 73) - 73
50 = 44 * l

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 44 to solve for l.
50 ÷ 44 = (44 * l) ÷ 44
50 ÷ 44 = l
&lt;&lt;50/44=1.136363636363636&gt;&gt;1.136363636363636 = l

Therefore, the value of l that satisfies the equation 123 = ((44 * l) + 73) is approximately 1.136363636363636.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation 165 = ((19 * q) + 75), we need to isolate the variable q on one side of the equation.

Step 1: Subtract 75 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing q.
165 - 75 = ((19 * q) + 75) - 75
90 = 19 * q

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 19 to solve for q.
90 ÷ 19 = (19 * q) ÷ 19
90/19 = q
&lt;&lt;90/19=4.736842105263158&gt;&gt;

Therefore, the value of q that satisfies the equation 165 = ((19 * q) + 75) is approximately 4.74.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation 149 = ((18 * g) + 62) for the value of g, we need to isolate the variable g on one side of the equation.

Step 1: Subtract 62 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term containing g.
149 - 62 = ((18 * g) + 62) - 62
87 = 18 * g

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 18 to solve for g.
87 ÷ 18 = (18 * g) ÷ 18
87/18 = g
&lt;&lt;87/18=29/6&gt;&gt;29/6 = g

Therefore, the value of g is 29/6, which can also be written as 4 5/6 or approximately 4.83.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation 84 = 20 * d + 21 for the variable d, we need to isolate d on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 21 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the right side, and then dividing both sides by 20.

Step 1: Subtract 21 from both sides of the equation.
84 - 21 = 20 * d + 21 - 21
63 = 20 * d

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 20.
63 ÷ 20 = 20 * d ÷ 20
3.15 = d

Therefore, the solution to the linear equation 84 = 20 * d + 21 is d = 3.15.

61 - 50 = (50 + (6 * g)) - 50
11 = 6 * g
