    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) The ^ symbol represents exponentiation. In this case, 1^3 means 1 raised to the power of 3, or 1 cubed.

2) Exponentiation is repeated multiplication. 1^3 is equivalent to 1 * 1 * 1.

3) 1 multiplied by itself any number of times is always 1.

   1 * 1 * 1 = 1

Therefore, 1^3 = 1.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great question! Let's solve 3^3 step by step.

1) As before, the ^ symbol represents exponentiation. 3^3 means 3 raised to the power of 3, or 3 cubed.

2) Exponentiation is repeated multiplication. 3^3 is equivalent to 3 * 3 * 3.

3) Let's perform the multiplication:
   
   3 * 3 = 9
   9 * 3 = 27

Therefore, 3^3 = 27.

This is different from the previous problem where we had 1^3. When you raise a number other than 1 to a power, the result is different. In this case, 3 multiplied by itself 3 times is 27.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the value of 1 raised to the power of 9, we can use the basic exponentiation rule:

1. For any real number a, a^1 = a
2. For any real number a (except 0), a^0 = 1
3. For any real number a and positive integers m and n, a^(m+n) = a^m × a^n

In this case, we have 1^9. Since any number raised to the power of 1 is equal to itself, and any number (except 0) raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, we can conclude that 1 raised to any power will always be equal to 1.

Therefore, 1^9 = 1.

        What would the result be if we change the exponent from 9 to 6 and compute the value of 1 raised to the power of 6 instead?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">If we change the exponent from 9 to 6 and compute the value of 1 raised to the power of 6, the result will still be 1.

As explained in the previous answer, any number raised to the power of 1 is equal to itself, and any number (except 0) raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1. This means that 1 raised to any power will always be equal to 1.

So, 1^6 = 1, just like 1^9 = 1.

The reason for this is that multiplying 1 by itself any number of times will always result in 1:

1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 × 1 × 1 = 1
...and so on.

Therefore, regardless of the exponent, as long as the base is 1, the result will always be 1.

When you square a number, you multiply it by itself once. For example:
1^2 = 1 × 1 = 1
2^2 = 2 × 2 = 4
3^2 = 3 × 3 = 9
4^2 = 4 × 4 = 16

In the expression 8^1, the base is 8 and the exponent is 1. This means that we need to multiply 8 by itself 1 time.

        What is the result if we replace the base number from the previous problem (which was 10), with 7? In other words, what is the value of 7^3?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve 7^3 step by step, just like we did with 10^3.

1) 7^3 means 7 multiplied by itself 3 times.

2) So, 7^3 = 7 × 7 × 7

3) First, 7 × 7 = 49

4) Then, 49 × 7 = 343

Therefore, 7^3 = 343.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great question! Let's solve 6^2 and compare it with the previous result of 4^2.

6^2 means we need to multiply 6 by itself 2 times.

6^2 = 6 × 6
    = 36

Comparing the results:
4^2 = 16
6^2 = 36

We can see that 6^2 is 20 more than 4^2.

36 - 16 = 20

Therefore, if we raise 6 to the power of 2 instead of 4, the outcome will be 20 more than the previous result.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) 10 raised to the power of 3 can be written as 10³.

2) This means we need to multiply 10 by itself 3 times:

   10³ = 10 × 10 × 10

3) Let's perform the multiplication:
   
   10 × 10 = 100
   100 × 10 = 1000

Therefore, 10³ = 1000.

3) Let's perform the multiplication:

   1 × 1 = 1

Therefore, 1³ = 1.

This is a special property of the number 1. Any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 1, and 1 raised to any power is always equal to 1.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this, let's break it down step-by-step:

1) The expression 3^3 means 3 to the power of 3, or 3 multiplied by itself 3 times.

1) The expression 5^3 means 5 to the power of 3, or 5 multiplied by itself 3 times.

3) Let's perform the multiplication:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) The ^ symbol represents exponentiation. In this case, 1^3 means 1 raised to the power of 3, or 1 cubed.

2) Exponentiation is repeated multiplication. 1^3 is equivalent to 1 × 1 × 1.

3) 1 multiplied by itself any number of times is always equal to 1.

1) 9^3 means 9 raised to the power of 3, or 9 cubed.

2) This is equivalent to 9 × 9 × 9.

3^6 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3

Let's calculate this step by step:

3 × 3 = 9
9 × 3 = 27
27 × 3 = 81
81 × 3 = 243
243 × 3 = 729

So, 3^1 = 3

This is true for any number raised to the power of 1. For example:

1^1 = 1
2^1 = 2
4^1 = 4
10^1 = 10

Therefore, 3 raised to the power of 1 is equal to 3.

This is because 3^1 = 3 × 1 = 3

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the value of 7^3, we need to multiply 7 by itself 3 times.

7^3 = 7 × 7 × 7

First, let's multiply 7 by 7:
7 × 7 = 49

Now, we multiply 49 by 7:
49 × 7 = 343

Therefore, 7^3 = 343.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Following on from the previous question, what would the outcome be if we replaced 7 with 9 in our exponent calculation? In other words, what is the value of 9^3?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great question! Let's apply the same process we used for 7^3 to find the value of 9^3.

To find the value of 9^3, we need to multiply 9 by itself 3 times.

9^3 = 9 × 9 × 9

First, let's multiply 9 by 9:
9 × 9 = 81

Now, we multiply 81 by 9:
81 × 9 = 729

Therefore, 9^3 = 729.

        What is the result when 1 is raised to the 5th power?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to understand what it means to raise a number to a power.

When a number is raised to a power, it means we multiply the number by itself the number of times indicated by the power.

In this case, 1 is raised to the 5th power, which means we multiply 1 by itself 5 times:

1^5 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 = 1

No matter how many times we multiply 1 by itself, the result will always be 1.

        What would be the result if 1 is raised to the 9th power instead of the 5th power?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">The process for solving this problem is the same as the previous one, but now we are raising 1 to the 9th power instead of the 5th power.

1^9 means we multiply 1 by itself 9 times:

1^9 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 1

Let's perform the multiplication:

1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 = 1
1 × 1 = 1

As we saw in the previous problem, no matter how many times we multiply 1 by itself, the result will always be 1. This is true for any positive integer power.
