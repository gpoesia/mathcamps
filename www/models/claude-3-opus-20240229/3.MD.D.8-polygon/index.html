        A sum of several measurements taken along the edge of a plot of land totals to 368 miles. The individual measurements are 41 miles, 28 miles, 90 miles, 32 miles, 10 miles, and 98 miles. What is the remaining measurement that hasn't been included in the total yet?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The total sum of all measurements is 368 miles.
   * The given individual measurements are 41, 28, 90, 32, 10, and 98 miles.

2. Add up the given individual measurements:
   * 41 + 28 + 90 + 32 + 10 + 98 = 299 miles

3. Subtract the sum of the given measurements from the total sum to find the remaining measurement:
   * Remaining measurement = Total sum - Sum of given measurements
   * Remaining measurement = 368 - 299 = 69 miles

Therefore, the remaining measurement that hasn't been included in the total yet is 69 miles.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) We know that a pentagon has 5 sides. We are given the lengths of 4 sides: 70cm, 36cm, 53cm, and 45cm. Let's call the length of the fifth side $x$.

2) The perimeter of a shape is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. We are told that the perimeter of this pentagon is 300cm.

3) We can set up an equation:

   $70 + 36 + 53 + 45 + x = 300$

4) Simplify the left side of the equation:

   $204 + x = 300$

5) Subtract 204 from both sides:

   $x = 300 - 204$
   $x = 96$

Therefore, the length of the fifth side is 96cm.

   $14 + 94 + 3 + 20 + 57 + 83 + 96 + 85 + x = 521$

3) Simplify the left side of the equation:

   $452 + x = 521$

4) Subtract 452 from both sides:

   $x = 521 - 452$

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall that the perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

2) We are given the lengths of five sides: 54cm, 51cm, 5cm, 22cm, and 93cm. Let's add these up:

   54 + 51 + 5 + 22 + 93 = 225 cm

3) We are also told that the total perimeter is 274cm. If we subtract the sum of the five known sides from the total perimeter, we will get the length of the sixth side:

   274 - 225 = 49 cm

Therefore, the length of the sixth side is 49cm.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) In a regular pentagon, all sides are equal in length. Let's call the length of each side $x$.

2) The perimeter of a shape is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 310 m, and there are 5 sides (because it's a pentagon).

3) We can express this as an equation:

   $5x = 310$

4) To find $x$, we divide both sides by 5:

   $x = 310 \div 5 = 62$

5) Therefore, each side of the pentagon is 62 m long.

1) First, let's recall the definition of perimeter. The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

2) We are given the lengths of 5 sides of the polygon: 78cm, 93cm, 21cm, 4cm, and 21cm. Let's call the unknown length of the last side x.

3) We also know that the total perimeter is 315cm. We can set up an equation:

   78 + 93 + 21 + 4 + 21 + x = 315

4) Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

   217 + x = 315

5) To solve for x, we subtract 217 from both sides:

   x = 315 - 217
   x = 98

Therefore, the length of the last side is 98cm.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) In a regular polygon, all sides are equal in length. Let's call the length of each side $x$.

2) The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 160m and there are 8 sides.

3) We can set up an equation:
   
   8 * $x$ = 160

4) Solving for $x$:
   
   $x$ = 160 / 8 = 20

2) We also know that the perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 224cm.

3) Let's call the missing side length x. We can set up an equation:

   6 + 4 + 95 + 34 + 19 + 14 + 26 + x = 224

4) Now, let's solve for x:

1) In a regular hexagon, all sides are equal in length. Let's call the length of one side $x$.

2) The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 174 meters.

3) Since a hexagon has 6 sides, and all sides are equal, we can set up the equation:

   $6x = 174$

4) Solving for $x$:

   $x = 174 \div 6 = 29$

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's approach this step by step:

1) A dodecagon is a 12-sided polygon. We are given the lengths of 10 sides, and the total perimeter.

2) To find the length of the 11th side, we can subtract the sum of the given 10 sides from the total perimeter. The remaining length will be the sum of the 11th and 12th sides.

3) Sum of the given 10 sides:
   65 + 22 + 32 + 31 + 78 + 88 + 7 + 29 + 36 + 54 = &lt;&lt;65+22+32+31+78+88+7+29+36+54=442&gt;&gt;442 cm

4) Remaining length (11th side + 12th side):
   538 - 442 = &lt;&lt;538-442=96&gt;&gt;96 cm

5) Since we are not given any information to distinguish the 11th and 12th sides, we can assume they are equal in length. So, each of these sides is half of the remaining length.

3) Let's call the unknown length of the last side x.

4) We can set up an equation:

2) In a regular polygon, all sides have equal length. Let's denote the length of each side as $s$.

3) The heptagon has 7 sides, so its perimeter formula is:

   Perimeter = 7 * $s$

4) We are given that the perimeter is 203m. Let's substitute this into the formula:

   203 = 7 * $s$

5) Now, we can solve for $s$ by dividing both sides by 7:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of the regular heptagon, we need to divide the perimeter by the number of sides.

Given:
- The perimeter of the regular heptagon is 329m.
- A heptagon has 7 sides.

Step 1: Divide the perimeter by the number of sides to find the length of each side.
Length of each side = Perimeter ÷ Number of sides
Length of each side = 329m ÷ 7
Length of each side = 47m

Therefore, the length of each side of the regular heptagon is 47m.

        The sides of a heptagon have lengths of 86m, 80m, 47m, 93m, and 99m. If the total perimeter of the heptagon is 486m, what is the length of the sixth side?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall that a heptagon has 7 sides. We are given the lengths of 5 sides and the total perimeter.

2) To find the length of the sixth side, we can:
   - Add up the lengths of the 5 known sides
   - Subtract this sum from the total perimeter
   - The difference will be the sum of the lengths of the two unknown sides

3) Sum of the lengths of the 5 known sides:
   86 + 80 + 47 + 93 + 99 = 405 m

4) Subtract this from the total perimeter:
   486 - 405 = 81 m

5) This 81 m is the sum of the lengths of the two unknown sides. Let's call the sixth side 'x' and the seventh side 'y'.
   x + y = 81 m

6) We need one more piece of information to solve for x and y individually. But the question only asks for the length of the sixth side, so we can conclude that the length of the sixth side is 81 m minus the length of the seventh side.

### Answer: The length of the sixth side is 81 m minus the length of the seventh side.</pre>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) A heptagon is a polygon with 7 sides.

2) If the heptagon is regular, all sides are equal in length. Let's call the length of each side $x$.

3) The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 546m.

4) Since all 7 sides are equal in length, we can set up the equation:

   7$x$ = 546

5) Dividing both sides by 7:

   $x$ = 546 ÷ 7 = 78

Therefore, the length of each side of the regular heptagon is 78m.

2) Now, we know that the perimeter of the nonagon is 532cm. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides. So, if we subtract the sum of the known sides from the perimeter, we'll get the length of the ninth side.

   532 - 457 = &lt;&lt;532-457=75&gt;&gt;75 cm

2) We are also told that all sides are equal in length. Let's call this length $x$.

3) The perimeter of the decagon is given as 452m. Since the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides, we can set up an equation:

   $62 + 76 + 98 + 74 + x + 54 + 4 + 24 + 48 + x = 452$

4) Simplify the left side of the equation:

3) We are told that the perimeter is 171m. Therefore:

1) A nonagon is a 9-sided polygon. We are given 8 side lengths and the perimeter. Let's call the unknown side length $x$.

2) The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of all its side lengths. We know the perimeter is 318 cm. So we can set up an equation:

   8 + 17 + 30 + 17 + 86 + 55 + 68 + $x$ = 318

3) Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation by adding the known side lengths:

   8 + 17 + 30 + 17 + 86 + 55 + 68 = &lt;&lt;8+17+30+17+86+55+68=281&gt;&gt;281

   So, 281 + $x$ = 318

4) To find $x$, we subtract 281 from both sides:

3) If we divide the perimeter by the number of sides, we will get the length of each side.

4) Number of sides in a decagon = 10

5) Length of each side = Perimeter ÷ Number of sides

3. Plug in the known values and solve for the length of each side:

   54 + 49 + 85 + 48 + 85 + 19 + 94 + 44 + 54 = 532 m

4) Now, we can subtract this sum from the total perimeter to get the length of the 10th side:

   575 - 532 = 43 m

Therefore, the length of the 10th side is 43 m.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) In a regular octagon, all sides are equal in length. Let's denote the length of each side as $s$.

2) The perimeter of the octagon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 248m.

3) Since there are 8 sides in an octagon, we can set up the following equation:

   $8s = 248$

4) To find the length of each side, we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

   $s = 248 \div 8 = 31$

Therefore, the length of each side of the regular octagon is 31m.

2) The perimeter of a shape is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 390m, and there are 5 sides (because it's a pentagon).

3) We can express this as an equation:

   $5x = 390$

4) To find the length of each side, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

   $x = 390 \div 5 = 78$

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.

2) If we denote the length of each side as $s$, then the perimeter of the hexagon is $6s$.

3) We are given that the perimeter is 36m. So we can write an equation:

   $6s = 36$

4) Solving for $s$:
   
   $s = 36 \div 6 = 6$

Therefore, the length of each side of the hexagon is 6m.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's find the sum of the lengths of the 11 sides that are already measured.

   88 + 24 + 83 + 64 + 16 + 14 + 90 + 36 + 47 = &lt;&lt;88+24+83+64+16+14+90+36+47=462&gt;&gt;462 cm

2) Now, we know that the total perimeter of the dodecagon is 492 cm. If we subtract the sum of the 11 sides from the total perimeter, we will get the length of the twelfth side.

   492 - 462 = &lt;&lt;492-462=30&gt;&gt;30 cm

Therefore, the length of the twelfth side is 30 cm.

1) A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.

2) If we know the perimeter, we can find the length of each side by dividing the perimeter by the number of sides.

3) Perimeter = 306m
   Number of sides = 6

4) Length of each side = Perimeter ÷ Number of sides
                       = 306m ÷ 6
                       = 51m

2) The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the heptagon has 7 sides, each of length $x$. So the perimeter is $7x$.

3) We are told that the perimeter is 238 meters. So we can set up an equation:

   $7x = 238$

4) To solve for $x$, we divide both sides by 7:

   $x = 238 \div 7 = 34$

1) First, let's understand what we know:
   - The polygon has 9 sides with known lengths.
   - The total perimeter of the polygon is 468 meters.

2) To find the length of the 10th side, we need to:
   - Sum up the lengths of the 9 known sides.
   - Subtract this sum from the total perimeter.

3) Sum of the 9 known sides:
   17 + 13 + 61 + 16 + 11 + 83 + 28 + 48 + 93 = 370 meters

4) Length of the 10th side:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's approach this step by step:

1) We know that the perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

2) We are given the lengths of 8 sides of the nonagon and the total perimeter. Let's call the length of the ninth side $x$.

3) We can set up an equation:

   $50 + 31 + 24 + 28 + 13 + 97 + 63 + 88 + x = 402$

4) Simplify the left side of the equation:

   $394 + x = 402$

5) Subtract 394 from both sides:

   $x = 402 - 394$
   $x = 8$

Therefore, the length of the ninth side is 8m.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) In a regular polygon, all sides are equal in length. Let's call the length of each side $x$.

2) The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the heptagon has 7 sides, each of length $x$. So the perimeter is $7x$.

3) We are told that the perimeter is 385m. So we can set up an equation:

   $7x = 385$

4) To find $x$, we divide both sides by 7:

   $x = 385 \div 7 = 55$

Therefore, each side of the heptagon is 55m long.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) Let the length of each side be x meters.

2) Since an octagon has 8 sides, and the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides, we can write an equation:

   This equation means: 8 times the length of each side (x) equals the total perimeter (496).

3) To find x, divide both sides of the equation by 8:

   x = 496 ÷ 8
   
   x = 62

3) Since there are 5 sides in a pentagon, we can set up the equation:

   $5x = 385$

4) To find the length of one side, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

   $x = 385 \div 5 = 77$

Therefore, the length of one side of the pentagon is 77 meters.

1) First, let's recall that a regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.

2) However, in this problem, we are given different lengths for 5 of the sides. Therefore, this is not a regular hexagon.

3) To find the length of the sixth side, we can use the given total perimeter and the lengths of the other five sides.

4) We know that the perimeter of a hexagon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Let's call the unknown length of the sixth side $x$.

   $9 + 49 + 100 + 73 + 84 + x = 380$

5) Simplify the left side of the equation:

   $315 + x = 380$

6) Subtract 315 from both sides:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. To find the length of one of the unknown sides, we need to use the given information about the total perimeter and the lengths of the known sides.

Given:
- The decagon has 10 sides.
- Eight of the sides measure 24m, 25m, 75m, 38m, 18m, 42m, and 61m.
- The total perimeter of the decagon is 359m.

Step 1: Calculate the sum of the lengths of the known sides.
Known sides sum = 24 + 25 + 75 + 38 + 18 + 42 + 61 = 283m

Step 2: Calculate the sum of the lengths of the two unknown sides by subtracting the sum of the known sides from the total perimeter.
Unknown sides sum = Total perimeter - Known sides sum
Unknown sides sum = 359m - 283m = 76m

Step 3: Assume that the two unknown sides have equal lengths. Calculate the length of one unknown side by dividing the sum of the unknown sides by 2.
Length of one unknown side = Unknown sides sum ÷ 2
Length of one unknown side = 76m ÷ 2 = 38m

Therefore, the length of each side of the regular decagon is 14m.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's recall the formula for the perimeter of a polygon:
   
   Perimeter = sum of the lengths of all sides

2) We are given the lengths of 10 sides. Let's sum them up:

   44 + 5 + 96 + 78 + 49 + 84 + 72 + 74 + 21 + 39 = 562 cm

3) We are also told that the total perimeter is 655 cm. If we know the total perimeter and the sum of 10 sides, we can find the length of the 11th side by subtracting:

   Length of 11th side = Total perimeter - Sum of other sides
                       = 655 cm - 562 cm
                       = 93 cm

Therefore, the length of the 11th side is 93 cm.

        A polygon has sides that measure 69m, 81m, 34m, 35m, and 38m respectively. If the polygon's total perimeter is 265m, what is the length of the remaining side?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's recall what perimeter means. The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

2) We are given that the polygon has sides that measure 69m, 81m, 34m, 35m, and 38m. Let's add these up:

   69m + 81m + 34m + 35m + 38m = 257m

3) We are also told that the polygon's total perimeter is 265m. Since we've accounted for all sides except one, the remaining side must account for the difference between the total perimeter and the sum of the known sides:

   Remaining side length = Total perimeter - Sum of known sides
                         = 265m - 257m
                         = 8m

Therefore, the length of the remaining side is 8m.

        A pentagon has four of its side lengths as 22m, 14m, 93m, and 75m respectively. If its total perimeter is 234m, find the length of the fifth side.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) We know that the perimeter of a pentagon is the sum of all its side lengths. Let's call the unknown fifth side length $x$.

2) We can set up an equation based on the given information:

   $22 + 14 + 93 + 75 + x = 234$

3) Simplify the left side of the equation:

   $204 + x = 234$

4) Subtract 204 from both sides:

   $x = 234 - 204$
   $x = 30$

Therefore, the length of the fifth side is 30m.
