        In their game, Kyle threw a ball for a distance of 18/4 yards, while Lisa threw the same ball for a distance of 19/9 yards. How many yards did the ball travel in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance the ball traveled, we need to add the distances thrown by Kyle and Lisa.

Given:
- Kyle threw the ball for a distance of 18/4 yards.
- Lisa threw the ball for a distance of 19/9 yards.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimals or find a common denominator to add the fractions.
Let's convert the fractions to decimals:
Kyle's throw: 18/4 = 4.5 yards
Lisa's throw: 19/9 ≈ 2.11 yards

Step 2: Add the distances thrown by Kyle and Lisa.
Total distance = Kyle's throw + Lisa's throw
Total distance = 4.5 yards + 2.11 yards
Total distance = 6.61 yards

Therefore, the ball traveled a total distance of approximately 6.61 yards.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the number of bananas Johnnie received in the morning and afternoon. However, the fractions have different denominators, so we first need to find a common denominator to add them together.

Given:
- Johnnie received 18/7 bananas in the morning.
- Johnnie received 12/14 bananas in the afternoon.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 7 and 14.
LCM(7, 14) = 14

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 14.
Morning bananas: 18/7 × 2/2 = 36/14
Afternoon bananas: 12/14 (already has a denominator of 14)

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
36/14 + 12/14 = 48/14

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction.
48/14 = 24/7 = 3 3/7

Therefore, Johnnie the monkey received a total of 3 3/7 bananas.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We already know that Johnnie received 3 3/7 bananas on the first day. Now, we need to find the total number of bananas Johnnie received over the two days.

Given:
- Johnnie received 3 3/7 bananas on the first day.
- The zookeeper gives Johnnie the same total amount of bananas the next day.

Step 1: Determine the number of bananas Johnnie received on the second day.
Second day bananas = 3 3/7 (same as the first day)

Step 2: Add the number of bananas from both days.
Total bananas = First day bananas + Second day bananas
Total bananas = 3 3/7 + 3 3/7

Step 3: Simplify the resulting fraction.
3 3/7 + 3 3/7 = 6 6/7

Therefore, Johnnie the monkey received a total of 6 6/7 bananas over the two days.

        The bottom of a door measures 4/19 inches from the floor, and the top of the door measures 9/10 inches from the ceiling. What is the total distance of the bottom and top of the door from the floor and ceiling, respectively?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. The bottom of the door is 4/19 inches from the floor.
2. The top of the door is 9/10 inches from the ceiling.
3. To find the total distance, we need to add these two fractions.

4/19 + 9/10

4. Before adding, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the product of the denominators: 19 × 10 = 190.

5. Now, we convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 190:

4/19 = (4 × 10)/(19 × 10) = 40/190
9/10 = (9 × 19)/(10 × 19) = 171/190

6. Add the fractions:

40/190 + 171/190 = 211/190

7. Simplify the fraction:

211/190 = 1 21/190 = 1 1/10

Therefore, the total distance of the bottom and top of the door from the floor and ceiling, respectively, is 1 1/10 inches.

        Ralph's juice recipe requires 17/3 liters of apple juice. However, he only uses 15/11 liters of it. How many liters of apple juice are left unused?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Ralph's recipe requires 17/3 liters of apple juice.
2. But he only uses 15/11 liters.
3. To find the unused amount, we need to subtract the used amount from the required amount.

Required amount: 17/3 liters
Used amount: 15/11 liters

4. To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 3 × 11 = 33.

17/3 = 17 × 11 / 3 × 11 = 187/33
15/11 = 15 × 3 / 11 × 3 = 45/33

5. Now we can subtract:

187/33 - 45/33 = 142/33

6. Simplify the fraction:

142/33 = 4 10/33 = 4 30/99 = 4 10/33

Therefore, 4 10/33 liters of apple juice are left unused.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's continue from the previous problem:

1. We found that 4 10/33 liters of apple juice were left unused.
2. Now, Ralph adds an additional 3/18 liters to the mix.
3. To find the new amount of unused apple juice, we need to subtract 3/18 from 4 10/33.

Unused amount: 4 10/33 liters
Added amount: 3/18 liters

4. To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 33 × 18 = 594.

4 10/33 = 4 × 18 + 10 × 18 / 33 × 18 = 72 + 180 / 594 = 252/594
3/18 = 3 × 33 / 18 × 33 = 99/594

5. Now we can subtract:

252/594 - 99/594 = 153/594

6. Simplify the fraction:

153/594 = 51/198 = 17/66

Therefore, after adding 3/18 liters of apple juice to the mix, 17/66 liters of apple juice are left unused.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, similar to the previous one.

Given:
- Ralph initially started with 17/3 liters of apple juice.
- He only used 14/11 liters.

Step 1: Find the common denominator to subtract the fractions.
The common denominator is 3 × 11 = 33.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
17/3 = 17 × 11 / 3 × 11 = 187/33
14/11 = 14 × 3 / 11 × 3 = 42/33

Step 3: Subtract the used amount from the initial amount.
187/33 - 42/33 = 145/33

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction.
145/33 = 4 13/33

Therefore, if Ralph had initially started with 17/3 liters of apple juice but had only used 14/11 liters, he would have 4 13/33 liters of apple juice left unused.

1. Billy initially travels 4 miles forward.

2. He then rolls back 17/20 of a mile.
   To convert 17/20 to a decimal, divide 17 by 20:
   17 ÷ 20 = 0.85 miles

3. To find the distance he ultimately traveled forward, subtract the distance he rolled back from the initial distance:
   4 miles - 0.85 miles = 3.15 miles

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Distance traveled on the first day:
   * The rocket traveled 15/3 light years on the first day.
   * 15/3 = 5 light years

2. Distance traveled on the second day:
   * The rocket traveled an additional 2/7 light years on the second day.

3. Total distance traveled:
   * Total distance = Distance on first day + Distance on second day
   * Total distance = 15/3 + 2/7
   * To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is 21 (the product of 3 and 7).
   * 15/3 = (15 × 7)/(3 × 7) = 105/21
   * 2/7 = (2 × 3)/(7 × 3) = 6/21

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 10/13 and 16/19. The least common multiple of 13 and 19 is 13 × 19 = 247.

2. Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 247:
   10/13 = 10 × 19/13 × 19 = 190/247
   16/19 = 16 × 13/19 × 13 = 208/247

3. Now we can add these fractions:
   190/247 + 208/247 = 398/247

4. Simplify the fraction:
   398/247 cannot be simplified further as 398 and 247 have no common factors other than 1.

Therefore, the total portion of the treasure map that Captain Silverbeard found is 398/247.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off and add the newly found portion to the total.

Given:
- Captain Silverbeard had already found 398/247 of the treasure map.
- He discovered another piece which is 15/17 of the total map.

Step 1: Convert 15/17 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 247 (the common denominator we found earlier).
15/17 = 15 × 247/17 × 247 = 3705/4199

Step 2: Add the new portion to the previously found portion.
398/247 + 3705/4199 = (398 × 4199 + 3705 × 247) / (247 × 4199)
                   = (1671202 + 915135) / 1037553
                   = 2586337 / 1037553

Step 3: Simplify the fraction.
2586337 and 1037553 have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the total portion of the treasure map that Captain Silverbeard has now is 2586337/1037553.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this new scenario, Captain Silverbeard found 10/9 of the map at the first site and 16/19 at the second site. Let's solve this step by step:

1. Convert 10/9 to an improper fraction: 10/9 = 1 1/9

2. Add the fractions 1 1/9 and 16/19:
   - First, convert the mixed number 1 1/9 to an improper fraction: 1 1/9 = 9/9 + 1/9 = 10/9
   - Now, find the common denominator of 9 and 19, which is 171 (9 × 19 = 171)
   - Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 171:
     10/9 = 10 × 19/9 × 19 = 190/171
     16/19 = 16 × 9/19 × 9 = 144/171
   - Add the fractions: 190/171 + 144/171 = 334/171

3. The sum 334/171 is an improper fraction. Convert it to a mixed number:
   334 ÷ 171 = 1 remainder 163
   So, 334/171 = 1 163/171

Therefore, the total portion of the treasure map that Captain Silverbeard found is 1 163/171, which is greater than 1. This means he found more than one complete map.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. The hiker walks 9/6 miles North.
   9/6 = 1 1/2 miles = 1.5 miles

2. Then, the hiker walks 2/16 miles East.
   2/16 = 1/8 miles = 0.125 miles

3. To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances:

        In Jessica's sandbox, she has a pile of sand that is 16/9 cubic feet. She then removes 4/13 cubic feet of sand from the sandbox. How much sand does she have left in her sandbox?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jessica's sandbox initially has 16/9 cubic feet of sand.
   * She removes 4/13 cubic feet of sand from the sandbox.

2. To find out how much sand is left, we need to subtract the removed amount from the initial amount:
   * Sand left = Initial amount - Removed amount
   * Sand left = 16/9 - 4/13

3. To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 13.
   * LCM(9, 13) = 117

4. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:
   * 16/9 = (16 × 13) / (9 × 13) = 208/117
   * 4/13 = (4 × 9) / (13 × 9) = 36/117

5. Now we can subtract the fractions:
   * Sand left = 208/117 - 36/117
   * Sand left = (208 - 36) / 117
   * Sand left = 172/117

6. Simplify the fraction if possible:
   * 172/117 cannot be simplified further as the greatest common factor (GCF) of 172 and 117 is 1.

Therefore, Jessica has 172/117 cubic feet of sand left in her sandbox.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off and find out how much sand Jessica has in her sandbox after adding more sand.

Given:
- Jessica had 172/117 cubic feet of sand in her sandbox.
- She adds an extra 19/15 cubic feet of sand.

Step 1: To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 117 and 15.
LCM(117, 15) = 1755

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:
- 172/117 = (172 × 15) / (117 × 15) = 2580/1755
- 19/15 = (19 × 117) / (15 × 117) = 2223/1755

Step 3: Add the fractions:
Total sand = 2580/1755 + 2223/1755
Total sand = (2580 + 2223) / 1755
Total sand = 4803/1755

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible:
4803/1755 cannot be simplified further as the greatest common factor (GCF) of 4803 and 1755 is 1.

Therefore, after adding an extra 19/15 cubic feet of sand, Jessica now has 4803/1755 cubic feet of sand in her sandbox.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jessica's sandbox initially has 16/9 cubic feet of sand.
   * She removes 4/8 cubic feet of sand from the sandbox.

2. To find out how much sand is left, we need to subtract the removed amount from the initial amount:
   * Sand left = Initial amount - Removed amount
   * Sand left = 16/9 - 4/8

3. To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 8.
   * LCM(9, 8) = 72

4. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:
   * 16/9 = (16 × 8) / (9 × 8) = 128/72
   * 4/8 = (4 × 9) / (8 × 9) = 36/72

5. Now we can subtract the fractions:
   * Sand left = 128/72 - 36/72
   * Sand left = (128 - 36) / 72
   * Sand left = 92/72

6. Simplify the fraction if possible:

1. First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The common denominator will be the product of the denominators: 12 * 17 = 204.

   15/12 = (15 * 17) / (12 * 17) = 255/204
   17/17 = (17 * 12) / (17 * 12) = 204/204

2. Now we can add the fractions:

   255/204 + 204/204 = (255 + 204) / 204 = 459/204

3. To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). The GCF of 459 and 204 is 51.

   459/204 = (459 ÷ 51) / (204 ÷ 51) = 9/4

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by using the result from the previous problem.

Given:
- Jacob starts with a rope that is ((15 / 12) + (17 / 17)) meters long.
- He wants to double the length by adding another piece of the same length.

Step 1: Determine the length of the initial rope.
From the previous problem, we know that ((15 / 12) + (17 / 17)) = 9/4 meters.

Step 2: Double the length of the initial rope.
To double the length, we multiply the initial length by 2.
(9/4) × 2 = 18/4

Step 3: Simplify the fraction.
18/4 = 9/2 meters or 4 1/2 meters.

Therefore, after adding another piece of the same length to the initial rope, the total length of the combined ropes will be 9/2 meters or 4 1/2 meters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem using the same steps as before:

1. Convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The common denominator will be the product of the denominators: 12 * 17 = 204.

   7/12 = (7 * 17) / (12 * 17) = 119/204
   17/17 = (17 * 12) / (17 * 12) = 204/204

2. Add the fractions:

   119/204 + 204/204 = (119 + 204) / 204 = 323/204

3. Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). The GCF of 323 and 204 is 17.

   323/204 = (323 ÷ 17) / (204 ÷ 17) = 19/12

4. The total length of the rope is 19/12 meters.

To convert 19/12 to a mixed number:
19 ÷ 12 = 1 remainder 7

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll first calculate the number of pants Mark had initially, and then add the new pants he bought.

Given:
- Mark initially had 1 full pair of pants and 13/4 pairs from incomplete sets.
- He buys an additional 13/3 pairs of pants.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pants Mark had initially.
- Convert 13/4 to a mixed number: 13 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 1, so 13/4 = 3 1/4
- Add the full pair to the incomplete pairs: 1 + 3 1/4 = 4 1/4 pairs of pants

Step 2: Convert the additional pants (13/3) to a mixed number.
- 13 ÷ 3 = 4 remainder 1, so 13/3 = 4 1/3 pairs of pants

Step 3: Add the initial number of pants to the newly bought pants.
- 4 1/4 + 4 1/3 = (17/4) + (13/3)
- To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 12 (LCM of 4 and 3).
- (17/4) = (51/12) and (13/3) = (52/12)
- (51/12) + (52/12) = 103/12
- Convert 103/12 to a mixed number: 103 ÷ 12 = 8 remainder 7, so 103/12 = 8 7/12

   8/8 = 152/152 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 19)
   152/152 = 152/19 ÷ 8 = 19/19 = 1

3. Now we can add the fractions:

The common denominator is 228 (19 × 12).

Step 2: Convert 39/19 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 228.

Step 3: Convert 1/12 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 228.
1/12 = (1 × 19)/(12 × 19) = 19/228

Step 4: Add the fractions.
468/228 + 19/228 = 487/228

Step 5: Simplify the fraction if possible.
The greatest common factor (GCF) of 487 and 228 is 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

4. To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
   The GCF of 264 and 104 is 8.
   264 ÷ 8 = 33
   104 ÷ 8 = 13

   So, 264/104 = 33/13

Therefore, with the updated information, Miss Jenny spent a total of 33/13 hours grading papers.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initial height of the cloud:
   * The cloud was initially observed at a height of 12/3 kms.
   * 12/3 = 4 kms

2. Height ascended by the cloud:
   * The cloud later ascended by 15/12 kms.
   * 15/12 = 1.25 kms

3. Resultant height of the cloud:
   * Resultant height = Initial height + Height ascended
   * Resultant height = 4 kms + 1.25 kms
   * Resultant height = 5.25 kms

Therefore, the resultant height of the cloud from the ground is 5.25 kms.

        Jack rides his scooter 3/9 of a mile to the library. After leaving, he scoots another 17/15 of a mile to his grandparents' house. How many miles does Jack ride his scooter in total?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Jack rides his scooter 3/9 of a mile to the library.
2. After leaving, he rides another 17/15 of a mile to his grandparents' house.
3. To find the total distance, we need to add the two fractions: 3/9 + 17/15

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 15.

4. LCM(9, 15) = 45

Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator of 45:

5. 3/9 = (3 × 5)/(9 × 5) = 15/45
6. 17/15 = (17 × 3)/(15 × 3) = 51/45

Add the fractions:

7. 15/45 + 51/45 = 66/45

Simplify the fraction:

8. 66/45 = 22/15 = 1 7/15

Therefore, Jack rides his scooter a total of 1 7/15 miles.

        After visiting his grandparents' house, Jack decides to ride his scooter to the park, which is another 20/12 of mile from his grandparents' house. How many miles does Jack ride his scooter in total now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off and add the additional distance to the park.

Given:
- Jack rides his scooter 3/9 of a mile to the library.
- He then rides 17/15 of a mile to his grandparents' house.
- From his grandparents' house, he rides another 20/12 of a mile to the park.

We already calculated the total distance from the library to his grandparents' house, which is 1 7/15 miles.

Now, let's add the distance from his grandparents' house to the park:

1. Convert 20/12 to an improper fraction: 20/12 = 1 8/12 = 1 2/3

2. Add the distance from the grandparents' house to the park to the previous total:
   1 7/15 + 1 2/3

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The LCM of 15 and 3 is 15.

3. Convert 1 2/3 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 15:
   1 2/3 = 1 (2 × 5)/(3 × 5) = 1 10/15

4. Add the fractions:
   1 7/15 + 1 10/15 = 2 17/15

5. Simplify the result:
   2 17/15 = 2 + 17/15 = 2 + 1 2/15 = 3 2/15

Therefore, the total distance Jack rides his scooter is 3 2/15 miles.

1. Jack rides his scooter 3/9 of a mile to the library.
2. After leaving, he rides another 17/20 of a mile to his grandparents' house.
3. To find the total distance, we need to add the two fractions: 3/9 + 17/20

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 20.

4. LCM(9, 20) = 180

Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator of 180:

5. 3/9 = (3 × 20)/(9 × 20) = 60/180 = 1/3
6. 17/20 = (17 × 9)/(20 × 9) = 153/180 = 17/20

Add the fractions:

7. 1/3 + 17/20 = 60/180 + 153/180 = 213/180

Simplify the fraction:

8. 213/180 = 1 33/180 = 1 11/60

Therefore, with the updated distances, Jack rides his scooter a total of 1 11/60 miles.

2. Find the total burn time for the twigs:
   * There are 16 twigs, and each burns for 1/12 of an hour.
   * Total burn time for twigs = 16 × 1/12 = 4/3 hours

3. Add the total burn time for logs and twigs:
   * Total burn time = Burn time for logs + Burn time for twigs
   * Total burn time = 1/4 + 4/3
   * To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 12.
   * 1/4 = 3/12 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 3)

2. Find the total burn time for the charcoal:
   * There are 8 pieces of charcoal, and each burns for 1/5 of an hour.
   * Total burn time for charcoal = 8 × 1/5 = 8/5 hours

3. Add the total burn time for logs, twigs, and charcoal:

        If Sam's binoculars increase his range of sight by 3/14 of a mile and Joe's binoculars increase his range of sight by exactly 1 mile (16/16), what is their combined range increase when they use the binoculars one after the other?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Sam's binoculars increase his range of sight by 3/14 of a mile.
   * Joe's binoculars increase his range of sight by 1 mile (16/16).

2. To find the combined range increase, we need to add the fractions:
   * Combined range increase = Sam's range increase + Joe's range increase
   * Combined range increase = 3/14 + 16/16

3. Before adding the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 14 and 16, which is 112.

4. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:
   * Sam's range increase: 3/14 = (3 × 8)/(14 × 8) = 24/112
   * Joe's range increase: 16/16 = (16 × 7)/(16 × 7) = 112/112

5. Add the fractions:
   * Combined range increase = 24/112 + 112/112 = 136/112

6. Simplify the fraction:
   * 136/112 = 17/14 (divide both numerator and denominator by 8)

Therefore, when Sam and Joe use their binoculars one after the other, their combined range increase is 17/14 of a mile.

        If Sam's binoculars instead increased his range of sight by 4/14 of a mile, while Joe's binoculars still increase his range of sight by exactly 1 mile, how much would their combined range increase be when they use the binoculars one after the other?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given:
- Sam's binoculars increase his range of sight by 4/14 of a mile.
- Joe's binoculars increase his range of sight by 1 mile (16/16).

Step 1: Express both fractions with a common denominator.
The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 14 and 16, which is 112.

Sam's range increase: 4/14 = (4 × 8)/(14 × 8) = 32/112
Joe's range increase: 16/16 = (16 × 7)/(16 × 7) = 112/112

Step 2: Add the fractions to find the combined range increase.
Combined range increase = Sam's range increase + Joe's range increase
Combined range increase = 32/112 + 112/112 = 144/112

Step 3: Simplify the fraction.
144/112 = 9/7 (divide both numerator and denominator by 16)

Therefore, when Sam and Joe use their binoculars one after the other, with Sam's binoculars increasing his range of sight by 4/14 of a mile and Joe's binoculars increasing his range of sight by 1 mile, their combined range increase is 9/7 of a mile.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Maria uses 15/10 yards of fabric for one section of the blanket.
   * She uses 9/18 more yards for another section.

2. Simplify the fractions:
   * 15/10 = 1 5/10 = 1 1/2 yards
   * 9/18 = 1/2 yard

3. Add the lengths of fabric used in both sections:
   * Total length = 1 1/2 + 1/2
   * To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 2.
   * 1 1/2 = 3/2

   * She uses 6/18 yards (instead of 9/18) for the other section.

2. Simplify the fractions:
   * 15/10 = 1 5/10 = 1 1/2 yards
   * 6/18 = 1/3 yard

3. Add the lengths of fabric used in both sections:
   * Total length = 1 1/2 + 1/3
   * To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 6.
   * 1 1/2 = 3/2 = 9/6

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Convert the fractions to decimals for easier calculation:
   * 10/5 = 2 miles
   * 5/16 = 0.3125 miles

2. The turtle walks forward 2 miles and then walks backward 0.3125 miles. To find the actual distance covered from its starting point, we need to subtract the backward distance from the forward distance:
   * Distance covered = Forward distance - Backward distance
   * Distance covered = 2 - 0.3125
   * Distance covered = 1.6875 miles

3. Convert the decimal back to a fraction:
   * 1.6875 = 1 11/16 miles

Therefore, the turtle has covered a distance of 1 11/16 miles from its starting point.

        In the previous question, we considered the turtle walking forward 10/5 miles and walking backward 5/16 mile. Now, assume instead that the turtle walks backward a distance of 5/6 miles instead of 5/16 mile after walking forward. Now, how far is the turtle from its starting point?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, using the new information that the turtle walks backward 5/6 miles instead of 5/16 miles.

Given:
- The turtle walks forward 10/5 miles.
- The turtle then walks backward 5/6 miles.

Step 1: Convert the forward distance to a decimal.
Forward distance = 10/5 miles = 2 miles

Step 2: Convert the backward distance to a decimal.
Backward distance = 5/6 miles ≈ 0.8333 miles

Step 3: Calculate the distance from the starting point by subtracting the backward distance from the forward distance.
Distance from starting point = Forward distance - Backward distance
Distance from starting point = 2 - 0.8333
Distance from starting point ≈ 1.1667 miles

Step 4: Convert the decimal result back to a mixed number.
1.1667 miles = 1 1/6 miles

Therefore, after walking forward 10/5 miles and then walking backward 5/6 miles, the turtle is approximately 1 1/6 miles away from its starting point.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of paint used, we need to add the amount of blue paint and white paint together.

Amount of blue paint: 18/11 liters
Amount of white paint: 1/8 liters

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 11 and 8 is 88.

18/11 = (18 × 8)/(11 × 8) = 144/88 liters
1/8 = (1 × 11)/(8 × 11) = 11/88 liters

Now we can add the fractions:
144/88 + 11/88 = (144 + 11)/88 = 155/88 liters

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). The GCF of 155 and 88 is 11.

1. Understand the given information:
   * One pot contains 12/13 of a pound of gold coins.
   * Another pot contains 3/2 pounds of gold coins.

2. To find the total amount of gold, we need to add the fractions:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, using the information from the previous problem.

Given:
- Each pond has 2 ducks.
- Each pool has 0.8 fish.
- There are 12 frogs evenly distributed across 4 lily pads.

Step 1: Find the number of frogs on each lily pad.
Number of frogs per lily pad = 12 ÷ 4 = 3 frogs per lily pad

Step 2: Add the number of animals in each respective setting (pond, pool, lily pad).
Total animals = Ducks per pond + Fish per pool + Frogs per lily pad
Total animals = 2 + 0.8 + 3 = 5.8

Therefore, the total number of animals on each respective setting (pond, pool, lily pad) combined is 5.8.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step with the new scenario:

1. Find the number of ducks in each pond:
   * There are now 2 ducks distributed equally among 5 ponds.
   * Number of ducks per pond = 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4 ducks per pond

2. Find the number of fish in each pool (this remains the same as before):
   * There are 8 fish distributed equally among 10 pools.
   * Number of fish per pool = 8 ÷ 10 = 0.8 fish per pool

3. Find the total number of animals in each pond and pool combined:
   * Each pond has 0.4 ducks and each pool has 0.8 fish.
   * Total animals per pond and pool = 0.4 + 0.8 = 1.2 animals

        On a map, 15/11 inches represents the distance between Town A and Town B, and 16/15 inches represents the distance between Town B and Town C. What is the total distance between Town A and Town C on the map?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The distance between Town A and Town B is represented by 15/11 inches on the map.
   * The distance between Town B and Town C is represented by 16/15 inches on the map.

2. To find the total distance between Town A and Town C, we need to add the distances from A to B and B to C:
   * Total distance = Distance from A to B + Distance from B to C
   * Total distance = 15/11 inches + 16/15 inches

3. Now, we need to add these fractions. To do this, we first need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the product of the denominators: 11 × 15 = 165.

4. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:
   * 15/11 = (15 × 15) / (11 × 15) = 225/165
   * 16/15 = (16 × 11) / (15 × 11) = 176/165

5. Add the fractions:
   * Total distance = 225/165 + 176/165
   * Total distance = (225 + 176) / 165
   * Total distance = 401/165

6. Simplify the fraction if possible:
   * 401/165 cannot be simplified further as there are no common factors between 401 and 165.

Therefore, the total distance between Town A and Town C on the map is 401/165 inches.

   * The distance between Town B and Town C is 16/15 inches on the map.
   * The distance between Town C and Town D is 20/5 inches on the map.

2. To find the total distance between Town A and Town D, we need to add the distances from A to B, B to C, and C to D:
   * Total distance = Distance from A to B + Distance from B to C + Distance from C to D
   * Total distance = 15/11 inches + 16/15 inches + 20/5 inches

3. Now, we need to add these fractions. To do this, we first need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators: LCM(11, 15, 5) = 165.

4. Convert all fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:
   * 15/11 = (15 × 15) / (11 × 15) = 225/165
   * 16/15 = (16 × 11) / (15 × 11) = 176/165
   * 20/5 = (20 × 33) / (5 × 33) = 660/165

5. Add the fractions:
   * Total distance = 225/165 + 176/165 + 660/165
   * Total distance = (225 + 176 + 660) / 165
   * Total distance = 1061/165

6. Simplify the fraction if possible:
   * 1061/165 cannot be simplified further as there are no common factors between 1061 and 165.

Therefore, the total distance between Town A and Town D on the map is 1061/165 inches.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same steps as before, but with the updated information.

Given:
- The distance between Town A and Town B is 15/11 inches on the map.
- The distance between Town B and Town C is 16/7 inches on the map.

Step 1: Add the distances from A to B and B to C to find the total distance.
Total distance = Distance from A to B + Distance from B to C
Total distance = 15/11 inches + 16/7 inches

Step 2: Find the common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator is the product of the denominators: 11 × 7 = 77.

Step 3: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
15/11 = (15 × 7) / (11 × 7) = 105/77
16/7 = (16 × 11) / (7 × 11) = 176/77

Step 4: Add the fractions.
Total distance = 105/77 + 176/77
Total distance = (105 + 176) / 77
Total distance = 281/77

Step 5: Simplify the fraction if possible.
281/77 cannot be simplified further as there are no common factors between 281 and 77.

Therefore, the total distance between Town A and Town C on the map is 281/77 inches.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The company produces 13/18 tons of Soap A per day.
   * The company produces 4/6 tons of Soap B per day.

2. Simplify the fraction 4/6 for Soap B:
   * 4/6 = 2/3 tons of Soap B per day

3. Add the amounts of Soap A and Soap B produced per day:
   * Total soap produced = Soap A + Soap B
   * Total soap produced = 13/18 + 2/3

4. Find a common denominator for the fractions 13/18 and 2/3:
   * The common denominator is 18 (LCM of 18 and 3)
   * 13/18 remains the same
   * 2/3 = (2 × 6)/(3 × 6) = 12/18

5. Add the fractions with the common denominator:
   * Total soap produced = 13/18 + 12/18
   * Total soap produced = (13 + 12)/18
   * Total soap produced = 25/18

6. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
   * 25/18 = 1 7/18 tons of soap per day

Therefore, the soap company produces 1 7/18 tons of soap in total each day.

        The soap company plans to double their daily production. After producing 13/18 tons of Soap A and 4/6 tons of Soap B each day, how many tons of soap will they produce in total when they double their production?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the same process as before, but we'll double the amounts at the end.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The company currently produces 13/18 tons of Soap A per day.
   * The company currently produces 4/6 tons of Soap B per day.
   * The company plans to double their daily production.

2. Simplify the fraction 4/6 for Soap B:
   * 4/6 = 2/3 tons of Soap B per day

3. Add the current amounts of Soap A and Soap B produced per day:
   * Total soap produced = Soap A + Soap B
   * Total soap produced = 13/18 + 2/3

4. Find a common denominator for the fractions 13/18 and 2/3:
   * The common denominator is 18 (LCM of 18 and 3)
   * 13/18 remains the same
   * 2/3 = (2 × 6)/(3 × 6) = 12/18

5. Add the fractions with the common denominator:
   * Total soap produced = 13/18 + 12/18
   * Total soap produced = (13 + 12)/18
   * Total soap produced = 25/18

6. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
   * 25/18 = 1 7/18 tons of soap per day

7. Double the total daily production:
   * Doubled production = 2 × (1 7/18)
   * Doubled production = 2 14/18
   * Simplify: 2 14/18 = 2 + 14/18 = 2 + 7/9 = 2 7/9 tons of soap per day

Therefore, when the soap company doubles their daily production, they will produce 2 7/9 tons of soap in total each day.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, using the same approach as before.

1. Understand the updated information:
   * The company now produces 17/18 tons of Soap A per day.
   * The company still produces 4/6 tons of Soap B per day.

2. Simplify the fraction 4/6 for Soap B (as we did in the previous problem):
   * 4/6 = 2/3 tons of Soap B per day

3. Add the updated amounts of Soap A and Soap B produced per day:
   * Total soap produced = Soap A + Soap B
   * Total soap produced = 17/18 + 2/3

4. Find a common denominator for the fractions 17/18 and 2/3:
   * The common denominator is 18 (LCM of 18 and 3)
   * 17/18 remains the same
   * 2/3 = (2 × 6)/(3 × 6) = 12/18

5. Add the fractions with the common denominator:
   * Total soap produced = 17/18 + 12/18
   * Total soap produced = (17 + 12)/18
   * Total soap produced = 29/18

6. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
   * 29/18 = 1 11/18 tons of soap per day

Therefore, after increasing the production of Soap A to 17/18 tons a day while maintaining the production of Soap B at 4/6 tons a day, the soap company now produces 1 11/18 tons of soap in total each day.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mark bought a sleeping bag that was 19/2 feet long.
   * He decides to cut off 13/12 feet from it.

2. Convert the mixed number 19/2 to an improper fraction:
   * 19/2 = (19 × 2) / 2 = 38/2 = 19

3. Subtract the length Mark cuts off (13/12 feet) from the original length of the sleeping bag (19 feet):
   * 19 - 13/12 = (19 × 12 - 13) / 12

        A jeweler has 5/14 pound of silver and adds 18/19 pounds more to the supply. How many pounds of silver does the jeweler have now to make rings?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the two fractions of pounds together to find the total amount of silver the jeweler has.

Given:
- The jeweler initially has 5/14 pound of silver.
- The jeweler adds 18/19 pounds more to the supply.

Step 1: Find a common denominator for the fractions.
The common denominator is 14 × 19 = 266.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
5/14 = (5 × 19) / (14 × 19) = 95/266
18/19 = (18 × 14) / (19 × 14) = 252/266

Step 3: Add the fractions.
95/266 + 252/266 = (95 + 252) / 266 = 347/266

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
347/266 cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the jeweler now has 347/266 pounds of silver to make rings.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's add the newly found 2/17 pounds of silver to the total amount the jeweler had before.

Given:
- The jeweler previously had 347/266 pounds of silver.
- The jeweler finds an additional 2/17 pounds of silver.

Step 1: Find a common denominator for the fractions.
The common denominator is 266 × 17 = 4,522.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
347/266 = (347 × 17) / (266 × 17) = 5,899/4,522
2/17 = (2 × 266) / (17 × 266) = 532/4,522

Step 3: Add the fractions.
5,899/4,522 + 532/4,522 = (5,899 + 532) / 4,522 = 6,431/4,522

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
6,431/4,522 cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, with the additional 2/17 pounds of silver found in his workshop's storage, the jeweler now has a total of 6,431/4,522 pounds of silver to make rings.

        In our previous scenario, suppose the jeweler initially had 8/14 pounds of silver instead of 5/14 pounds and then added 18/19 pounds more to his supplies. How many pounds of silver does the jeweler now have to make rings?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem using the same steps as before, but with the updated initial amount of silver.

Given:
- The jeweler initially has 8/14 pound of silver.
- The jeweler adds 18/19 pounds more to the supply.

Step 1: Find a common denominator for the fractions.
The common denominator is 14 × 19 = 266.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
8/14 = (8 × 19) / (14 × 19) = 152/266
18/19 = (18 × 14) / (19 × 14) = 252/266

Step 3: Add the fractions.
152/266 + 252/266 = (152 + 252) / 266 = 404/266

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
404/266 = 202/133

Therefore, with the updated initial amount of silver, the jeweler now has 202/133 pounds of silver to make rings.

        A turtle starts at a point and moves 11 meters northward. Then, it moves 15/15 of a meter back towards the starting point. How many meters is the turtle from its starting point after these two movement?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. The turtle first moves 11 meters northward from its starting point.

2. Then, it moves back towards the starting point. The distance it moves back is 15/15 of a meter.
   15/15 = 1, so the turtle moves 1 meter back towards the starting point.

3. To find the turtle's distance from the starting point, we need to subtract the distance it moved back from the initial distance it moved northward.
   Distance from starting point = 11 meters - 1 meter = 10 meters

Therefore, after these two movements, the turtle is 10 meters away from its starting point.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off.

Given:
- The turtle was 10 meters away from its starting point after the first two movements.
- The turtle then moves an additional 15/20 of a meter in the same direction (northward).

Step 1: Convert 15/20 to a decimal.
15/20 = 0.75 meters

Step 2: Add the additional distance to the previous distance from the starting point.
New distance from starting point = Previous distance + Additional distance
New distance from starting point = 10 meters + 0.75 meters = 10.75 meters

Therefore, after moving an additional 15/20 of a meter northward, the turtle is now 10.75 meters away from its original starting point.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. The turtle first moves 11 meters northward from its starting point.

2. Then, it moves back towards the starting point. The distance it moves back is 15/8 of a meter.
   15/8 = 1.875 meters

3. To find the turtle's distance from the starting point, we need to subtract the distance it moved back from the initial distance it moved northward.
   Distance from starting point = 11 meters - 1.875 meters = 9.125 meters

Therefore, after these two movements, the turtle is 9.125 meters away from its starting point.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Chloe's chocolate bar is 19/2 ounces.
   * She eats a piece that is 17/2 ounces.

2. Subtract the amount Chloe ate from the total chocolate bar:
   * Remaining chocolate = Total chocolate - Eaten chocolate
   * Remaining chocolate = 19/2 - 17/2

3. Simplify the fraction:
   * 19/2 - 17/2 = (19 - 17)/2 = 2/2 = 1

Therefore, Chloe has 1 ounce of chocolate left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off and solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Chloe had 1 ounce of chocolate left from the previous problem.
- She adds a piece from another chocolate bar that weighs 4/14 ounces.

Step 1: Add the remaining chocolate from the previous problem to the new piece.
Chloe's current chocolate = Remaining chocolate + New piece
Chloe's current chocolate = 1 + 4/14

Step 2: Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction.
1 + 4/14 = 14/14 + 4/14 = 18/14

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 18 and 14 is 2.
18/14 = (18 ÷ 2)/(14 ÷ 2) = 9/7

Therefore, Chloe now has 9/7 ounces of chocolate.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the new information.

Given:
- Originally, Chloe's chocolate bar was 19/2 ounces.
- In this scenario, she eats a piece that is 9/2 ounces.

Step 1: Subtract the amount Chloe ate from the total chocolate bar.
Remaining chocolate = Total chocolate - Eaten chocolate
Remaining chocolate = 19/2 - 9/2

Step 2: Simplify the fraction.
19/2 - 9/2 = (19 - 9)/2 = 10/2

Step 3: Simplify the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
GCF of 10 and 2 is 2.
(10 ÷ 2) / (2 ÷ 2) = 5/1 = 5

Therefore, if Chloe had eaten a piece that was 9/2 ounces, she would have had 5 ounces of chocolate left.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Sammy's backpack has a capacity of 20/9 liters.
   * He adds a pouch that can hold 8/4 more liters.

2. Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions:
   * The backpack's capacity is already in an improper fraction: 20/9 liters.
   * The pouch's capacity is also in an improper fraction: 8/4 liters.

3. Add the capacities of the backpack and the pouch:
   * Total capacity = Backpack capacity + Pouch capacity
   * Total capacity = 20/9 + 8/4

4. Simplify the fraction 8/4:
   * 8/4 = 2

5. Add 20/9 and 2:
   * Total capacity = 20/9 + 2
   * Total capacity = 20/9 + 18/9 (converting 2 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 9)
   * Total capacity = 38/9 liters

Therefore, the total capacity of Sammy's backpack after adding the pouch is 38/9 liters.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off and add the capacity of the tiny side pocket to the total capacity we calculated earlier.

Given:
- Sammy's expanded backpack has a capacity of 38/9 liters.
- He finds a tiny side pocket that can carry an extra 3/8 of a liter.

Step 1: Add the capacity of the tiny side pocket to the total capacity of the expanded backpack.
Total capacity = Expanded backpack capacity + Tiny side pocket capacity
Total capacity = 38/9 + 3/8

Step 2: Find a common denominator for 9 and 8 to add the fractions.
The common denominator is 72 (9 × 8 = 72).

Step 3: Convert 38/9 and 3/8 to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 72.
38/9 = (38 × 8)/(9 × 8) = 304/72
3/8 = (3 × 9)/(8 × 9) = 27/72

Step 4: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
Total capacity = 304/72 + 27/72 = 331/72

Step 5: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
331/72 cannot be simplified further as there are no common factors between 331 and 72.

Therefore, the total capacity of Sammy's backpack, including the expanded backpack and the tiny side pocket, is 331/72 liters.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Sammy's backpack has a capacity of 20/12 liters.
   * He adds a pouch that can hold 8/4 more liters.

2. Simplify the fraction 20/12:
   * 20/12 = 5/3 liters

3. Convert the mixed number 8/4 to an improper fraction:
   * The pouch's capacity is already in an improper fraction: 8/4 liters.

4. Add the capacities of the backpack and the pouch:
   * Total capacity = Backpack capacity + Pouch capacity
   * Total capacity = 5/3 + 8/4

5. Find a common denominator for 5/3 and 8/4:
   * The common denominator is 12 (LCM of 3 and 4)
   * 5/3 = 20/12 (multiply numerator and denominator by 4)
   * 8/4 = 24/12 (multiply numerator and denominator by 3)

6. Add the fractions with the common denominator:
   * Total capacity = 20/12 + 24/12
   * Total capacity = 44/12

7. Simplify the fraction 44/12:
   * 44/12 = 11/3 liters

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Captain Hook initially has 11/8 ounces of gold.
   * He finds an additional 5/5 ounces of gold.

2. Convert the fractions to have a common denominator:
   * 11/8 is already in the simplest form.
   * 5/5 is equal to 1 (since any number divided by itself is 1).

3. Add the fractions:
   * Total gold = 11/8 + 1
   * To add a whole number to a fraction, convert the whole number to a fraction with the same denominator as the other fraction.
   * 1 = 8/8 (since 1 * 8/8 = 8/8)
   * Total gold = 11/8 + 8/8
   * Total gold = (11 + 8)/8
   * Total gold = 19/8

4. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number (if needed):
   * 19/8 = 2 3/8 (since 8 goes into 19 twice with a remainder of 3)

Therefore, Captain Hook now has a total of 2 3/8 ounces of gold.

   * Captain Hook had a total of 2 3/8 ounces of gold.
   * He discovers an additional 7/11 ounces of gold.

2. Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:
   * 2 3/8 = (2 × 8 + 3)/8 = 19/8

3. Find the common denominator for 19/8 and 7/11:
   * The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 11.
   * LCM(8, 11) = 88

4. Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

   * 265/88 cannot be simplified further as the greatest common factor (GCF) of 265 and 88 is 1.

7. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
   * 265/88 = 3 1/88 (since 88 goes into 265 three times with a remainder of 1)

Therefore, Captain Hook now has a total of 3 1/88 ounces of gold.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        In the previous treasure hunt, Captain Hook had originally found 11/8 ounces of gold. But let's say, instead of finding 5/5 ounces of gold as he did in his latest treasure hunt, he discovered 7/5 ounces of gold. How much total weight of gold would Captain Hook have had then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, using the same method as before:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Captain Hook initially has 11/8 ounces of gold.
   * In this scenario, he finds an additional 7/5 ounces of gold.

2. Convert the fractions to have a common denominator:
   * 11/8 is already in the simplest form.
   * 7/5 needs to be converted to have a denominator of 8.
   * 7/5 = (7 × 8)/(5 × 8) = 56/40 = 1 16/40 = 1 2/5

3. Add the fractions:
   * Total gold = 11/8 + 1 2/5
   * Convert the mixed number (1 2/5) to an improper fraction: 1 2/5 = 7/5
   * Convert 7/5 to have a denominator of 8: 7/5 = 56/40 = 1 16/40 = 1 2/5
   * Total gold = 11/8 + 1 2/5
   * Total gold = 11/8 + 10/8 (since 1 2/5 = 10/8)
   * Total gold = (11 + 10)/8
   * Total gold = 21/8

4. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
   * 21/8 = 2 5/8 (since 8 goes into 21 twice with a remainder of 5)

Therefore, if Captain Hook had discovered 7/5 ounces of gold in his latest treasure hunt, he would have had a total of 2 5/8 ounces of gold.

        If Jake originally had 9/10 of a dollar and then received an additional 20/15 of a dollar, how much money does he have in his wallet now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jake originally had 9/10 of a dollar.
   * He received an additional 20/15 of a dollar.

2. Convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions:
   * Jake's original amount: 9/10 dollar
   * Additional amount received: 20/15 dollar = 4/3 dollar

3. Add the fractions:
   * Total amount = Original amount + Additional amount
   * Total amount = 9/10 + 4/3
   * To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is 30.
   * 9/10 = 27/30 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 3)
   * 4/3 = 40/30 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 10)
   * Total amount = 27/30 + 40/30 = 67/30

4. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed fraction:
   * 67/30 = 2 10/30 (divide 67 by 30, quotient is 2 and remainder is 10)
   * 10/30 can be simplified to 1/3 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10
   * Total amount = 2 1/3 dollars

Therefore, Jake now has 2 1/3 dollars in his wallet.

        Paul has built the front half of a chair that measures 5/2 feet high. He also constructs the back portion of the chair that measures 20/14 feet. What is the combined height of the front and back portions of the chair that Paul has constructed?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. The front half of the chair measures 5/2 feet high.
   5/2 = 2.5 feet

2. The back portion of the chair measures 20/14 feet.
   To simplify this fraction, divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
   GCF of 20 and 14 is 2.
   (20/2) / (14/2) = 10/7 feet

3. To find the combined height, we add the front and back portions:
   2.5 feet + 10/7 feet

   To add these together, we need to convert 10/7 to a decimal or convert 2.5 to an improper fraction.
   10/7 ≈ 1.43 feet (rounded to two decimal places)

   2.5 feet + 1.43 feet = 3.93 feet

Therefore, the combined height of the front and back portions of the chair is approximately 3.93 feet.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, let's understand what 12/9 of John's shirts means. 
   - If we divide 12 by 9, we get 1 1/3, or 1.333... 
   - This means John donated more shirts than he actually had.

2) Since John only has 5 shirts, he can't donate more than 5. 
   - The question doesn't make sense in a real-world context, because you can't donate a fraction of a shirt.

3) If we interpret the question mathematically and allow for fractions of shirts:
   - John had 5 shirts.
   - He donated 12/9 * 5 = 60/9 = 6 2/3 shirts.
   - He would have 5 - 6 2/3 = -1 2/3 shirts left, which is a negative number.

However, in reality, you can't have a negative number of shirts.

        Bob has a jacket that measures 14/3 meters in length. However, he finds the jacket is slightly too long for him so he decides to cut off 14/16 meter from the original length. What is the length of Bob's jacket after the alteration?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Bob's jacket originally measures 14/3 meters in length.
   * Bob wants to cut off 14/16 meter from the original length.

2. Convert the original length of the jacket from an improper fraction to a mixed number:
   * 14/3 = 4 2/3 meters

3. Convert 14/16 meter to a proper fraction:
   * 14/16 = 7/8 meter

4. Subtract the length Bob cuts off from the original length:
   * 4 2/3 - 7/8 meters
   * First, convert the mixed number 4 2/3 to an improper fraction:
     * 4 2/3 = (4 × 3 + 2) / 3 = 14/3 meters
   * Now, subtract 7/8 from 14/3:
     * 14/3 - 7/8 = (14 × 8 - 7 × 3) / (3 × 8)
     * = (112 - 21) / 24
     * = 91/24 meters

5. Convert the result back to a mixed number:
   * 91/24 = 3 19/24 meters

Therefore, after cutting off 14/16 meter, the length of Bob's jacket is 3 19/24 meters.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's continue from the previous solution:

1. The current length of Bob's jacket is 3 19/24 meters.
2. Bob decides to cut off an additional 9/4 meters.

3. Convert 3 19/24 meters to an improper fraction:
   * 3 19/24 = (3 × 24 + 19) / 24 = 91/24 meters

4. Subtract 9/4 meters from 91/24 meters:
   * 91/24 - 9/4 meters
   * To subtract fractions with different denominators, find the least common denominator (LCD):
     * LCD of 24 and 4 is 24
   * Convert 9/4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 24:
     * 9/4 = (9 × 6) / (4 × 6) = 54/24 meters
   * Now, subtract 54/24 from 91/24:
     * 91/24 - 54/24 = (91 - 54) / 24 = 37/24 meters

5. Convert the result to a mixed number:
   * 37/24 = 1 13/24 meters

Therefore, after cutting off an additional 9/4 meters, the remaining length of Bob's jacket is 1 13/24 meters.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Apologies for the confusion. Let's solve the problem with the updated information:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Bob's jacket originally measures 16/3 meters in length.
   * Bob wants to cut off 14/16 meter from the original length.

2. Convert the original length of the jacket from an improper fraction to a mixed number:
   * 16/3 = 5 1/3 meters

3. Convert 14/16 meter to a proper fraction:
   * 14/16 = 7/8 meter

4. Subtract the length Bob cuts off from the original length:
   * 5 1/3 - 7/8 meters
   * First, convert the mixed number 5 1/3 to an improper fraction:
     * 5 1/3 = (5 × 3 + 1) / 3 = 16/3 meters
   * Now, subtract 7/8 from 16/3:
     * 16/3 - 7/8 = (16 × 8 - 7 × 3) / (3 × 8)
     * = (128 - 21) / 24
     * = 107/24 meters

5. Convert the result back to a mixed number:
   * 107/24 = 4 11/24 meters

Therefore, after cutting off 14/16 meter from the new original length of 16/3 meters, the length of Bob's jacket would be 4 11/24 meters.

1. Officer Max spends 2/6 part of an hour completing paperwork.
2. He then spends 14/7 parts of an hour patrolling the neighborhood.
3. To find the total time spent on these two tasks, we need to add the fractions:
   2/6 + 14/7

4. Before adding fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 7.
   LCM(6, 7) = 42

5. Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 42:
   2/6 = 2 × 7/6 × 7 = 14/42
   14/7 = 14 × 6/7 × 6 = 84/42

6. Add the fractions:
   14/42 + 84/42 = 98/42

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off and find out how many hours are left in Officer Max's shift after completing his paperwork and neighborhood patrol.

Given:
- Officer Max's shift at the police station typically lasts 20 hours.
- He spends 49/21 parts of an hour on paperwork and neighborhood patrol.

Step 1: Convert 49/21 parts of an hour to hours.
49/21 ÷ 1 = 49/21 hours = 2 1/3 hours (or 2.33 hours)

Step 2: Subtract the time spent on paperwork and patrol from the total shift duration.
Time left in the shift = Total shift duration - Time spent on paperwork and patrol
Time left in the shift = 20 hours - 2 1/3 hours
Time left in the shift = 20 hours - 2.33 hours = 17.67 hours

Step 3: Convert 17.67 hours to hours and minutes.
0.67 hours = 0.67 × 60 minutes = 40.2 minutes (rounded to 40 minutes)

Therefore, Officer Max has 17 hours and 40 minutes left in his shift after completing his paperwork and neighborhood patrol.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's find the time John spent watching the movie:
   * John watched the movie for 10/12 of an hour.
   * 10/12 = 5/6 (simplify the fraction)
   * So, John watched the movie for 5/6 of an hour.

2. Next, let's find the time John spent watching the TV show:
   * John watched the TV show for 3/8 of an hour.

3. Now, let's add the time he spent watching the movie and the TV show:
   * Total time = Time watching movie + Time watching TV show
   * Total time = 5/6 + 3/8
   * To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 6 and 8 is 24.
   * 5/6 = 20/24 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 4)
   * 3/8 = 9/24 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 3)
   * Total time = 20/24 + 9/24 = 29/24

4. Let's convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
   * 29 ÷ 24 = 1 with a remainder of 5
   * So, 29/24 = 1 5/24

Therefore, the total time John spent watching the movie and the TV show is 1 5/24 hours.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, let's find the total time John spent watching the movie and TV show in one routine:
   * Time spent watching the movie = 10/12 of an hour
   * Time spent watching the TV show = 3/8 of an hour
   * Total time for one routine = 10/12 + 3/8
   * To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 12 and 8 is 24.
   * 10/12 = 20/24 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 2)
   * 3/8 = 9/24 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 3)
   * Total time for one routine = 20/24 + 9/24 = 29/24

2. Now, let's calculate the total time for repeating the routine:
   * Total time = Time for one routine × 2
   * Total time = 29/24 × 2
   * Total time = 58/24

3. Let's simplify the fraction:
   * 58 ÷ 24 = 2 with a remainder of 10
   * So, 58/24 = 2 10/24
   * Simplify 10/24 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2
   * 10/24 = 5/12

Therefore, the total time John spent watching the movie and TV show, repeating the routine, is 2 5/12 hours.

        If instead of watching the movie for 10/12 of an hour, John watched it for 10/7 of an hour, and he still watched the TV show for another 3/8 of an hour, what is the total time he spent watching in hours?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. Time John spent watching the movie:
   * John watched the movie for 10/7 of an hour.

2. Time John spent watching the TV show:
   * John watched the TV show for 3/8 of an hour.

3. Add the time he spent watching the movie and the TV show:
   * Total time = Time watching movie + Time watching TV show
   * Total time = 10/7 + 3/8
   * To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 8 is 56.
   * 10/7 = 80/56 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 8)
   * 3/8 = 21/56 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 7)
   * Total time = 80/56 + 21/56 = 101/56

4. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
   * 101 ÷ 56 = 1 with a remainder of 45
   * So, 101/56 = 1 45/56

Therefore, the total time John spent watching the movie and the TV show is 1 45/56 hours.

        Mr. Carpenter makes crafting chairs a meticulous process. He takes 5/3 hours to build the frame and additional 10/13 hours to upholster it. How long does it take for him to build a chair from start to finish?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mr. Carpenter takes 5/3 hours to build the frame of a chair.
   * He takes an additional 10/13 hours to upholster the chair.

2. To find the total time, we need to add the time taken for building the frame and upholstering:
   * Total time = Time for building frame + Time for upholstering
   * Total time = 5/3 + 10/13

3. To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 13 is 39:
   * 5/3 = 5 × 13/3 × 13 = 65/39
   * 10/13 = 10 × 3/13 × 3 = 30/39

4. Now we can add the fractions:
   * Total time = 65/39 + 30/39
   * Total time = 95/39

5. Simplify the fraction:
   * 95/39 cannot be simplified further as 95 and 39 have no common factors other than 1.

So, it takes Mr. Carpenter 95/39 hours to build a chair from start to finish.

        Mr. Carpenter has now taken on an additional task. After building the chair and doing the upholstery work, he spends another 8/19 hours to apply the varnish. Now, how long does the entire process of making a chair take?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, using the information from the previous problem.

Given:
- Mr. Carpenter takes 5/3 hours to build the frame of a chair.
- He takes an additional 10/13 hours to upholster the chair.
- He spends another 8/19 hours to apply the varnish.

Step 1: Calculate the total time without varnishing (from the previous problem).
Total time without varnishing = 5/3 + 10/13 = 95/39 hours

Step 2: Add the time for varnishing to the total time.
Total time = Total time without varnishing + Time for varnishing
Total time = 95/39 + 8/19

Step 3: Find a common denominator for 39 and 19 to add the fractions. The common denominator is 741 (39 × 19).
- 95/39 = 95 × 19/39 × 19 = 1805/741
- 8/19 = 8 × 39/19 × 39 = 312/741

Step 4: Add the fractions.
Total time = 1805/741 + 312/741 = 2117/741

Step 5: Simplify the fraction if possible.
2117 and 741 have no common factors other than 1, so 2117/741 cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the entire process of making a chair, including building the frame, upholstering, and varnishing, takes Mr. Carpenter 2117/741 hours.

        In another batch of chair production, Mr. Carpenter managed to reduce his timeframe. Now, he takes only 5/10 hours to build the frame of the chair while the time for upholstery stays the same as 10/13 hours. How long does it take for him to build a chair with the new time for frame construction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step with the new information:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mr. Carpenter now takes 5/10 hours (or 1/2 hour) to build the frame of a chair.
   * The time for upholstery remains the same at 10/13 hours.

2. To find the total time, we need to add the new time taken for building the frame and the time for upholstering:
   * Total time = Time for building frame + Time for upholstering
   * Total time = 5/10 + 10/13

3. To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 10 and 13 is 130:
   * 5/10 = 5 × 13/10 × 13 = 65/130
   * 10/13 = 10 × 10/13 × 10 = 100/130

4. Now we can add the fractions:
   * Total time = 65/130 + 100/130
   * Total time = 165/130

5. Simplify the fraction:
   * 165/130 = 33/26 (divide both numerator and denominator by 5)

So, with the new time for frame construction, it takes Mr. Carpenter 33/26 hours to build a chair from start to finish.

2. Simplify the diameter of the small bead:
   * Diameter of small bead = 8/4 mm
   * 8/4 = 2 mm

3. Simplify the diameter of the large bead:
   * Diameter of large bead = 15/2 mm

LCM of 18 and 2 is 18.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator of 18.
11/18 is already in the correct form.
8/2 = (8 × 9)/(2 × 9) = 72/18

1. Fabric needed for the sleeping bag: 12/14 yards
2. Fabric needed for the liner: 8/5 yards

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 14 and 5 is 70.

3. Converting 12/14 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 70:
   12/14 = (12 × 5)/(14 × 5) = 60/70

4. Converting 8/5 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 70:
   8/5 = (8 × 14)/(5 × 14) = 112/70

1. Fabric needed for the sleeping bag: 2 16/35 yards
2. Total fabric bought: 17 yards

To find out how many yards of fabric Johnathan has left, we need to subtract the fabric used for the sleeping bag from the total fabric bought.

3. Converting 2 16/35 to an improper fraction:
   2 16/35 = (2 × 35 + 16)/35 = 86/35

4. Converting 17 to an improper fraction with denominator 35:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off and solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Jake has 13/7 of a yard of fabric after combining the two pieces.
- He needs to remove 4/16 of a yard of fabric for the shirt to fit perfectly.

Step 1: Convert 13/7 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 16.
13/7 = (13 × 16)/(7 × 16) = 208/112

Step 2: Convert the improper fraction 208/112 to a mixed number.
208 ÷ 112 = 1 remainder 96
208/112 = 1 96/112

Step 3: Simplify the fraction 96/112 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 16.
96/112 = (96 ÷ 16)/(112 ÷ 16) = 6/7

So, 208/112 = 1 6/7

Step 4: Subtract 4/16 from 1 6/7.
1 6/7 - 4/16

First, convert 6/7 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 16.
6/7 = (6 × 2)/(7 × 2) = 12/14
12/14 = (12 × 8)/(14 × 8) = 96/112
96/112 = (96 ÷ 16)/(112 ÷ 16) = 6/7

Now, subtract:
1 6/7 - 4/16 = 1 + 6/7 - 4/16
             = 1 + 42/112 - 4/16
             = 1 + 21/56 - 1/4
             = 1 + 21/56 - 14/56
             = 1 + 7/56
             = 63/56

Therefore, after making the adjustment, Jake will have 63/56 of a yard of fabric left.

        Let's say Jake originally had less fabric, only 12/6 yards instead of 12/7 yards. He still finds an additional piece of fabric that measures 2/14 of a yard. If he combines both these pieces now, then how much fabric does he have altogether for his shirt?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. Jake has 12/6 of a yard of fabric.
2. He finds another piece that measures 2/14 of a yard.
3. First, simplify 12/6 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 6:
   12/6 = (12 ÷ 6)/(6 ÷ 6) = 2/1 = 2 yards
4. Now, we need to add 2 yards and 2/14 of a yard.
5. Convert 2 yards to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 14:
   2 = 28/14 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 14)
6. Now we can add the fractions:
   28/14 + 2/14 = 30/14
7. Simplify the fraction:
   30/14 = 15/7 (dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 2)

Therefore, when Jake combines both pieces of fabric, he will have 15/7 of a yard.

        A ballerina starts with a routine that lasts 13/5 minutes but decides to shorten it by 15/16 minutes. How long is her routine after shortening it?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The initial routine lasts 13/5 minutes.
   * The ballerina decides to shorten it by 15/16 minutes.

2. Convert the mixed number 13/5 to an improper fraction:
   * 13/5 = (5 × 2 + 3) / 5 = 13/5

3. Subtract the time she shortens the routine by (15/16) from the initial routine time (13/5):
   * 13/5 - 15/16
   * To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 5 × 16 = 80.
   * 13/5 = (13 × 16) / (5 × 16) = 208/80
   * 15/16 = (15 × 5) / (16 × 5) = 75/80
   * 208/80 - 75/80 = 133/80

4. Simplify the resulting fraction:
   * 133/80 cannot be simplified further as the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.

5. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
   * 133 ÷ 80 = 1 remainder 53
   * 133/80 = 1 53/80

Therefore, after shortening her routine, the ballerina's routine will last 1 53/80 minutes.

1 53/80 = (1 × 80 + 53) / 80 = 133/80

Step 2: Convert 2/20 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 80.
2/20 = (2 × 4) / (20 × 4) = 8/80

Step 3: Add the fractions.

Given:
- The initial routine lasts 13/5 minutes.
- The ballerina decides to shorten it by 12/16 minutes.

Step 1: Convert 13/5 to an improper fraction.
13/5 = (5 × 2 + 3) / 5 = 13/5

Step 2: Subtract the time she shortens the routine by (12/16) from the initial routine time (13/5).
- Find the common denominator: 5 × 16 = 80
- Convert 13/5 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 80:
  13/5 = (13 × 16) / (5 × 16) = 208/80
- Convert 12/16 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 80:

- Subtract: 208/80 - 60/80 = 148/80

Step 3: Simplify the resulting fraction.
148/80 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4.
148 ÷ 4 = 37
80 ÷ 4 = 20
Simplified fraction: 37/20

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction:
   19/6 = 3 + 1/6 = (3 × 6 + 1) / 6 = 19/6

2. Subtract the amount of fertilizer used on roses from the total amount:
   19/6 - 17/20

3. To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 20, which is 60.

4. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:
   19/6 = (19 × 10) / (6 × 10) = 190/60
   17/20 = (17 × 3) / (20 × 3) = 51/60

5. Now we can subtract the fractions:
   190/60 - 51/60 = (190 - 51) / 60 = 139/60

6. Simplify the fraction:
   139/60 = 2 + 19/60 = 2 + (1 × 60 + 19) / 60 = 2 + 79/60 = 2 19/60

Given:
- Miss Daisy had 19/6 kg of fertilizer initially.
- She used 17/20 kg on her roses.
- She found an additional 11/11 kg of fertilizer in her shed.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of fertilizer left after using 17/20 kg on her roses (from the previous scenario).
19/6 - 17/20 = 190/60 - 51/60 = 139/60 = 2 19/60 kg

Step 2: Add the newly found fertilizer to the remaining amount.
2 19/60 + 11/11

Step 3: Convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction.
2 19/60 = (2 × 60 + 19) / 60 = 139/60

Step 4: Find the common denominator for 139/60 and 11/11, which is 660.

Step 5: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
139/60 = (139 × 11) / (60 × 11) = 1529/660
11/11 = (11 × 60) / (11 × 60) = 660/660

Step 6: Add the fractions.
1529/660 + 660/660 = (1529 + 660) / 660 = 2189/660

Step 7: Simplify the fraction.
2189/660 = 3 + 209/660 = 3 + (1 × 660 + 209) / 660 = 3 + 869/660 = 3 209/660

1. The moon is moving away from Earth by 4/16 meters every year.
   4/16 = 1/4 meter per year

2. This year, there was an additional increase of 20/6 meters.
   20/6 = 10/3 meters

3. To find the total change in distance this year, we add the regular yearly increase and the additional increase:
   Total change = Regular yearly increase + Additional increase
                = 1/4 + 10/3 meters

4. To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 3 is 12.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from the previous scenario and calculate the total expected change in distance from Earth to the moon after the predicted additional increase.

Given:
- The regular yearly increase is 1/4 meter.

- Scientists predict an additional increase of 16/6 meters in the coming year.

Step 1: Simplify the predicted additional increase.
16/6 = 8/3 meters

Step 2: Add the regular yearly increase, the total change from this year, and the predicted additional increase.
Total expected change = Regular yearly increase + Total change this year + Predicted additional increase

3 7/12 = (3 × 12 + 7) / 12 = 43/12

Step 4: Find a common denominator for all fractions (4, 12, and 3).
The common denominator is 12.
1/4 = 3/12
43/12 (no change needed)
8/3 = 32/12

Step 5: Add the fractions.
3/12 + 43/12 + 32/12 = 78/12 meters

Step 6: Simplify the result.
78/12 = 6 6/12 = 6 1/2 meters

Therefore, the total expected change in distance from Earth to the moon after the predicted additional increase is 6 1/2 meters.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Continuing from the previous scenario, suppose scientists later realized that there was a calculation error. Instead of an unexpected increase of 20/6 meters in the moon's distance this year, they found the increase was actually 20/18 meters. Given this corrected value, what is the total change in distance from the Earth to the moon this year?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. The moon is moving away from Earth by 4/16 meters every year.
   4/16 = 1/4 meter per year

2. This year, there was an additional increase of 20/18 meters (corrected value).
   20/18 = 10/9 meters

3. To find the total change in distance this year, we add the regular yearly increase and the additional increase:
   Total change = Regular yearly increase + Additional increase
                = 1/4 + 10/9 meters

4. To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 9 is 36.
   1/4 = 9/36
   10/9 = 40/36

5. Now we can add the fractions:
   9/36 + 40/36 = 49/36 meters

6. Simplify the fraction:
   49/36 = 1 13/36 meters

Therefore, with the corrected value for the unexpected increase, the total change in distance between the moon and Earth this year is 1 13/36 meters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, let's add the fractions 11/3 and 12/19.
2. To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD).
3. The LCD of 3 and 19 is 3 × 19 = 57.
4. Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 57:
   11/3 = 11 × 19/3 × 19 = 209/57
   12/19 = 12 × 3/19 × 3 = 36/57
5. Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions:
   209/57 + 36/57 = (209 + 36)/57 = 245/57
6. Simplify the fraction 245/57 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF):
   The GCF of 245 and 57 is 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, Bob has 245/57 dollars in total in his wallet.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll first find the total amount of money Bob has in his wallet, and then we'll duplicate that amount.

Step 1: Find the total amount of money in Bob's wallet.
- Bob has 11/3 dollars in one pocket and 12/19 dollars in another pocket.
- To add fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 3 and 19, which is 57.
- Convert 11/3 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 57: 11/3 × 19/19 = 209/57
- Convert 12/19 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 57: 12/19 × 3/3 = 36/57
- Add the fractions: 209/57 + 36/57 = 245/57

So, Bob has 245/57 dollars in total in his wallet.

Step 2: Duplicate the total amount of money in Bob's wallet.
- To duplicate the amount, we multiply the total by 2.
- 245/57 × 2 = 490/57

Now, let's simplify the fraction 490/57:
- Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
- The GCF of 490 and 57 is 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, if Bob duplicates the total amount of money in his wallet, he will have 490/57 dollars.

1 = 19/19

Step 2: Add the fractions 19/19 and 12/19.
19/19 + 12/19 = (19 + 12)/19 = 31/19

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, let's simplify the fractions:
   - The shark swam 5/5 miles in the morning, which simplifies to 1 mile.
   - In the afternoon, the shark swam an additional 12/18 miles. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 6.
     12 ÷ 6 = 2
     18 ÷ 6 = 3
     So, 12/18 simplifies to 2/3 miles.

2. Now, we can add the distances the shark swam in the morning and afternoon:
   1 + 2/3 = 3/3 + 2/3 = 5/3 miles

3. To convert the improper fraction 5/3 to a mixed number, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
   5 ÷ 3 = 1 remainder 2
   This means 5/3 is equal to 1 2/3 miles.

Therefore, the shark swam a total of 1 2/3 miles that day.

Given:
- The shark swam 1 2/3 miles in total during the morning and afternoon.
- In the evening, the shark swam an additional 18/9 miles.

Step 1: Simplify the evening distance.
18/9 = 2 (dividing both numerator and denominator by their GCF, which is 9)

Step 2: Add the evening distance to the total distance from the morning and afternoon.
1 2/3 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2/3 = 3 + 2/3 = 3 2/3 miles

Therefore, if the shark swims an additional 18/9 miles in the evening, the total distance the shark would have swum by the end of the day is 3 2/3 miles.

        Continuing from the last problem, suppose the shark had only swam 5/12 miles in the morning instead of 5/5 miles, but still swam the additional 12/18 miles in the afternoon. How many miles would the shark have swam in the morning and afternoon combined?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, using the same method as before.

Given:
- The shark swam 5/12 miles in the morning.
- The shark swam an additional 12/18 miles in the afternoon.

Step 1: Simplify the fractions.
- The morning distance (5/12) is already in its simplest form.
- The afternoon distance (12/18) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 6.
  12 ÷ 6 = 2
  18 ÷ 6 = 3
  So, 12/18 simplifies to 2/3 miles.

Step 2: Find a common denominator for the fractions to add them easily.
- The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 3, which is 12.
- Convert 2/3 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 12:
  2/3 = 2/3 × 4/4 = 8/12

Step 3: Add the distances the shark swam in the morning and afternoon.
5/12 + 8/12 = 13/12 miles

Step 4: Convert the improper fraction 13/12 to a mixed number.
13 ÷ 12 = 1 remainder 1
This means 13/12 is equal to 1 1/12 miles.

Therefore, if the shark swam 5/12 miles in the morning and 12/18 miles in the afternoon, it would have swam a total of 1 1/12 miles that day.

Given:
- Jim and Mary's initial combined typing speed is 3.5 words per second.
- They reduce their combined typing speed by 2 words every 11 seconds.

Step 1: Calculate the reduction in typing speed per second.
Reduction per second = Reduction in words ÷ Time
Reduction per second = 2 ÷ 11 ≈ 0.1818 words per second

Step 2: Calculate the new combined typing speed by subtracting the reduction from the initial speed.
New combined typing speed = Initial combined typing speed - Reduction per second
New combined typing speed = 3.5 - 0.1818 ≈ 3.3182 words per second

4. First, let's convert 9/7 to an improper fraction: 9/7 = 63/7

5. Now, we need to subtract 1/9 from 63/7. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is 63 (7 * 9 = 63).

   63/7 = 567/63
   1/9 = 7/63

6. Now we can subtract:

        If Timmy dumps 7/2 kg of sand into his sandbox and later adds another 1/2 kg, how much sand is now in his sandbox?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Timmy first dumps 7/2 kg of sand into his sandbox.
   * Later, he adds another 1/2 kg of sand.

2. Add the two amounts of sand together:
   * Total sand = 7/2 kg + 1/2 kg
   * To add fractions, we need a common denominator. In this case, both fractions already have a common denominator of 2.
   * Total sand = (7 + 1) / 2 kg
   * Total sand = 8/2 kg

3. Simplify the fraction:
   * 8/2 kg = 4 kg

Therefore, there is now 4 kg of sand in Timmy's sandbox.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from the previous scenario and solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- The sandbox initially contained 4 kg of sand.
- Timmy dumps another 16/3 kg of sand into the sandbox.

Step 1: Add the new amount of sand to the existing sand in the sandbox.
Total sand = Existing sand + New sand
Total sand = 4 kg + 16/3 kg

Step 2: Convert the mixed number (4 kg) to an improper fraction.
4 kg = 12/3 kg

Step 3: Add the fractions.
Total sand = 12/3 kg + 16/3 kg
Total sand = (12 + 16) / 3 kg
Total sand = 28/3 kg

Step 4: Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number.
28/3 kg = 9 1/3 kg

Therefore, the sandbox now contains 9 1/3 kg of sand.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Timmy first dumps 7/2 kg of sand into his sandbox.
   * Later, he adds another 1/20 kg of sand.

2. Add the two amounts of sand together:
   * Total sand = 7/2 kg + 1/20 kg
   * To add fractions, we need a common denominator. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 20.
   * LCM(2, 20) = 20
   * Now, we convert 7/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 20:
     * 7/2 = (7 × 10) / (2 × 10) = 70/20

3. Add the fractions with the common denominator:
   * Total sand = 70/20 kg + 1/20 kg
   * Total sand = (70 + 1) / 20 kg
   * Total sand = 71/20 kg

4. Simplify the fraction:
   * 71/20 kg cannot be simplified further as 71 and 20 have no common factors other than 1.

Therefore, there is now 71/20 kg of sand in Timmy's sandbox.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total ounces of ingredients used, we need to add the amount of moon roots and stardust.

Moon roots: 18/8 ounces
Stardust: 11/7 ounces

First, let's convert the fractions to mixed numbers:
18/8 = 2 2/8 = 2 1/4 ounces of moon roots
11/7 = 1 4/7 ounces of stardust

Now, we need to add these mixed numbers:
2 1/4 + 1 4/7

To add mixed numbers, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 1/4 and 4/7 is 28.

2 1/4 = 2 7/28
1 4/7 = 1 16/28

Now, we can add the fractions:
2 7/28 + 1 16/28 = 3 23/28

Finally, we can convert the improper fraction 23/28 to a mixed number:
23/28 = 0 23/28 = 0 5/7 (since 23 ÷ 28 = 0 remainder 23)

Therefore, the total amount of ingredients used is:

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. The UFO traveled 3/10 of a mile in the first part of its journey.

2. In the second part, it traveled an additional 16/20 of a mile.
   To add these fractions, we need to convert them to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
   
   Least common multiple of 10 and 20 is 20. So, we'll convert 3/10 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 20.
   3/10 = (3 × 2)/(10 × 2) = 6/20

3. Now we can add the fractions:
   6/20 + 16/20 = 22/20

4. To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 2:
   22/20 = (22 ÷ 2)/(20 ÷ 2) = 11/10

5. Finally, we can convert 11/10 to a mixed number:
   11/10 = 1 1/10 miles

Therefore, the UFO traveled a total of 1 1/10 miles.

Given:
- Initially, the UFO traveled 3/10 of a mile.
- Then, it traveled an extra 16/18 of a mile.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 10 and 18 is 90. So, we'll convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 90.

3/10 = (3 × 9)/(10 × 9) = 27/90
16/18 = (16 × 5)/(18 × 5) = 80/90

Step 2: Add the fractions.
27/90 + 80/90 = 107/90

Step 3: Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number.
107/90 = 1 17/90

Therefore, in this scenario, the UFO traveled a total of 1 17/90 miles.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Machine 1 makes 4/14 of a chair every hour.
   To simplify the fraction, divide both the numerator and denominator by 2:
   4/14 = 2/7 chairs per hour

2. Machine 2 makes 20/4 chairs per hour.
   To simplify the fraction, divide the numerator by the denominator:
   20/4 = 5 chairs per hour

3. To find the total number of chairs made by both machines in one hour, add the number of chairs made by each machine:
   Machine 1: 2/7 chairs
   Machine 2: 5 chairs
   
   To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 7.
   5 chairs = 35/7 chairs (multiply both the numerator and denominator by 7)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. Machine 1 now makes 17/14 of a chair every hour.

2. Machine 2 still makes 20/4 chairs per hour.
   To simplify the fraction, divide the numerator by the denominator:
   20/4 = 5 chairs per hour

3. To find the total number of chairs made by both machines in one hour, add the number of chairs made by each machine:
   Machine 1: 17/2 chairs
   Machine 2: 5 chairs
   
   To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 2.
   5 chairs = 10/2 chairs (multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2)

- The hammerhead shark swam for 7/10 miles.

Step 1: Convert 2/4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 20 (the least common multiple of 4 and 10).
2/4 = 2 × 5/4 × 5 = 10/20

Step 2: Convert 7/10 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 20.
7/10 = 7 × 2/10 × 2 = 14/20

- The great white shark swam for 9/14 miles.

Step 1: Convert all fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 10, and 14 is 140.

Blue shark: 2/4 = 2 × 35/4 × 35 = 70/140
Hammerhead shark: 7/10 = 7 × 14/10 × 14 = 98/140

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of milk Lisa has, we need to add the amounts in both bottles.

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple of 18 and 8, which is 72.

8/18 = (8 × 4)/(18 × 4) = 32/72
18/8 = (18 × 9)/(8 × 9) = 162/72

Now, we can add the fractions:
32/72 + 162/72 = 194/72

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2.
194/72 = (194 ÷ 2)/(72 ÷ 2) = 97/36

To convert the fraction to a mixed number, we divide 97 by 36:
97 ÷ 36 = 2 remainder 25
So, 97/36 = 2 25/36

    <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous question, we found that Lisa had 2 25/36 gallons of milk in total from the first two bottles. Now, we need to add the amount of milk from the third bottle to this total.

First, let's convert 6/16 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 36 (to match the denominator of the total from the first two bottles).

6/16 = (6 × 9)/(16 × 9) = 54/144 = 3/8

Now, let's add 3/8 to 2 25/36:

2 25/36 + 3/8

To add these mixed numbers, we first need to convert 3/8 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 36.

3/8 = (3 × 9)/(8 × 9) = 27/72

Now, we can add:

2 25/36 + 27/72 = 2 25/36 + 9/36 = 2 34/36

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2.

2 34/36 = 2 (34 ÷ 2)/(36 ÷ 2) = 2 17/18

Therefore, after adding the milk from the third bottle, Lisa now has 2 17/18 gallons of milk in total.

1. The tree grows 1/10 of its height every month.
2. This month, it has grown an additional 12/6 feet due to fertilizer.
3. To find the total growth this month, we need to add the regular growth (1/10 of its height) and the additional growth (12/6 feet).

First, let's simplify 12/6:
12/6 = 2 feet

Now, we can express the total growth as:
Total growth = 1/10 of the tree's height + 2 feet

Since the question doesn't provide the tree's actual height, we cannot calculate the exact value of 1/10 of its height. Therefore, the total growth can only be expressed as a sum of fractions and a whole number.

Area of the large tent = 13/11 acres
Area of the small tent = 8/20 acres

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 11 and 20 is 220 (11 × 20 = 220).

Large tent area in 220ths: 13/11 × 20/20 = 260/220 acres
Small tent area in 220ths: 8/20 × 11/11 = 88/220 acres

Total area = Large tent area + Small tent area

1. Find the distance traveled to the East:
   - The treasure is located (17 / 20) km to the East.
   - (17 / 20) km = 0.85 km

2. Find the distance traveled to the North:
   - After reaching the point to the East, they need to travel (15 / 3) km to the North.
   - (15 / 3) km = 5 km

3. Calculate the total distance traveled:
   - The total distance is the sum of the distances traveled to the East and to the North.
   - Total distance = Distance to the East + Distance to the North
   - Total distance = 0.85 km + 5 km
   - Total distance = 5.85 km

Therefore, Captain Jack and his crew must travel a total of 5.85 km to reach the treasure.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Sarah collected 11/20 pounds of firewood.

2. Alex collected 9/7 pounds of firewood.

3. To find the total amount of firewood collected, we need to add the fractions:
   11/20 + 9/7

4. To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD):
   LCD of 20 and 7 is 140.

5. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD:
   11/20 = (11 × 7) / (20 × 7) = 77/140
   9/7 = (9 × 20) / (7 × 20) = 180/140

6. Add the fractions:
   77/140 + 180/140 = 257/140

7. Simplify the fraction:
   257/140 cannot be simplified further.

8. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
   257 ÷ 140 = 1 remainder 117
   1 117/140 = 1 + 117/140 = 1 + (1 × 20 + 17) / 140 = 1 + 37/140 = 1 37/140

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, let's convert the fractions to decimals for easier calculation:
   * 19/5 = 3.8 miles
   * 12/15 = 0.8 miles

2. Now, we can add the two distances together to find the total distance sailed north:
   * Total distance = 3.8 miles + 0.8 miles
   * Total distance = 4.6 miles

3. To convert the decimal back to a mixed number:
   * 4.6 = 4 + 0.6
   * 0.6 = 6/10
   * 6/10 can be reduced to 3/5 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off and solve this problem step by step.

Given:
- Captain Bill sailed a total of 4 3/5 miles north.
- He then backtracked and went 20/17 miles south.

Step 1: Convert 4 3/5 miles to an improper fraction.
4 3/5 = (4 × 5 + 3) / 5 = 23/5 miles

Step 2: Subtract the distance traveled south from the total distance traveled north.
Distance from the original starting point = 23/5 - 20/17 miles

Step 3: Find a common denominator for the fractions 23/5 and 20/17.
The common denominator is 5 × 17 = 85.

Step 4: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
23/5 = (23 × 17) / (5 × 17) = 391/85 miles
20/17 = (20 × 5) / (17 × 5) = 100/85 miles

Step 5: Subtract the fractions.
Distance from the original starting point = 391/85 - 100/85 = 291/85 miles

Step 6: Simplify the fraction.
291/85 cannot be simplified further as 291 and 85 have no common factors other than 1.

Therefore, Captain Bill is located 291/85 miles north of the original starting point.

   * 12/15 = 0.8 miles

2. Add the two distances together to find the total distance sailed north:
   * Total distance = 1.0556 miles + 0.8 miles
   * Total distance ≈ 1.8556 miles

3. Convert the decimal to a mixed number:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Lucy's sleeping bag is 18/19 meter long.
   * She got an extension that made the sleeping bag 8/11 meter longer.

2. To find the total length, we need to add the original length and the extension length:
   * Total length = Original length + Extension length
   * Total length = 18/19 + 8/11

3. To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 19 and 11.
   * LCM(19, 11) = 19 × 11 = 209

4. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:
   * 18/19 = (18 × 11) / (19 × 11) = 198/209
   * 8/11 = (8 × 19) / (11 × 19) = 152/209

5. Add the fractions:
   * Total length = 198/209 + 152/209
   * Total length = (198 + 152) / 209
   * Total length = 350/209

6. Simplify the fraction if possible:
   * 350/209 cannot be simplified further as 350 and 209 have no common factors other than 1.

Therefore, the total length of Lucy's sleeping bag after adding the extension is 350/209 meter.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same steps as before, but with the new extension length.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Lucy's sleeping bag is 18/19 meter long.
   * She got an extension that is 8/8 meter long.

2. To find the total length, we need to add the original length and the extension length:
   * Total length = Original length + Extension length
   * Total length = 18/19 + 8/8

3. Simplify the fraction 8/8:
   * 8/8 = 1

4. Now, we need to add a fraction and a whole number:
   * Total length = 18/19 + 1

5. To add a fraction and a whole number, we need to convert the whole number to a fraction with the same denominator as the other fraction:
   * 1 = 19/19

6. Add the fractions:
   * Total length = 18/19 + 19/19
   * Total length = (18 + 19) / 19
   * Total length = 37/19

7. Simplify the fraction if possible:
   * 37/19 cannot be simplified further as 37 and 19 have no common factors other than 1.

Therefore, the total length of Lucy's sleeping bag after adding the 8/8 meter extension is 37/19 meter.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Sarah pours 10/13 gallon of water into the container first.

2. Then she adds another 8/2 gallons of water.
   To add fractions, we need to convert them to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
   8/2 can be simplified to 4/1 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2.
   &lt;&lt;8/2 = 4/1&gt;&gt;

3. Now, we need to find the common denominator of 10/13 and 4/1.
   The common denominator is 13 (since 13 is already the denominator of 10/13, and 4/1 can be converted to an equivalent fraction with denominator 13).
   4/1 = (4 × 13)/(1 × 13) = 52/13
   &lt;&lt;4/1 = 52/13&gt;&gt;

4. Add the fractions:
   10/13 + 52/13 = (10 + 52)/13 = 62/13
   &lt;&lt;10/13 + 52/13 = 62/13&gt;&gt;

5. Simplify the result:
   62/13 = 4 10/13 (because 13 goes into 62 four times with a remainder of 10)
   &lt;&lt;62/13 = 4 10/13&gt;&gt;

Therefore, there are 4 10/13 gallons of water in the container now.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, similar to the previous one:

1. Sarah pours 10/13 gallon of water into the container first.

2. This time, she adds 16/2 gallons of water instead of 8/2 gallons.
   To add fractions, we need to convert them to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
   16/2 can be simplified to 8/1 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2.
   &lt;&lt;16/2 = 8/1&gt;&gt;

3. Now, we need to find the common denominator of 10/13 and 8/1.
   The common denominator is 13 (since 13 is already the denominator of 10/13, and 8/1 can be converted to an equivalent fraction with denominator 13).
   8/1 = (8 × 13)/(1 × 13) = 104/13
   &lt;&lt;8/1 = 104/13&gt;&gt;

4. Add the fractions:
   10/13 + 104/13 = (10 + 104)/13 = 114/13
   &lt;&lt;10/13 + 104/13 = 114/13&gt;&gt;

5. Simplify the result:
   114/13 = 8 10/13 (because 13 goes into 114 eight times with a remainder of 10)
   &lt;&lt;114/13 = 8 10/13&gt;&gt;

Therefore, by adding 16/2 gallons instead of 8/2 gallons, Sarah now has a total of 8 10/13 gallons of water in the container.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mandy has 9/2 KGs of apples.
   * She uses 1/4 KG of apples to make apple pie.

2. Convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction:
   * 9/2 = 4 1/2
   * 4 1/2 = (4 × 2 + 1) / 2 = 9/2

3. Subtract the amount of apples used for the pie from the total amount:
   * Remaining apples = Total apples - Apples used for pie
   * Remaining apples = 9/2 - 1/4
   * To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 4.
   * 9/2 = 18/4 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 2)
   * 18/4 - 1/4 = 17/4

4. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed fraction:
   * 17/4 = 4 1/4 (divide 17 by 4, which gives 4 with a remainder of 1)

Therefore, Mandy has 4 1/4 KGs of apples left.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mandy has 9/2 KGs of apples initially.
   * She uses 1/4 KG of apples to make apple pie.
   * She finds 3/19 KG more apples in her refrigerator.

2. Convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction:
   * 9/2 = 4 1/2
   * 4 1/2 = (4 × 2 + 1) / 2 = 9/2

3. Subtract the amount of apples used for the pie from the total amount:
   * Remaining apples after making pie = Total apples - Apples used for pie
   * Remaining apples after making pie = 9/2 - 1/4
   * To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 4.
   * 9/2 = 18/4 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 2)
   * 18/4 - 1/4 = 17/4

4. Add the apples found in the refrigerator:
   * Total apples now = Remaining apples after making pie + Apples found in refrigerator
   * Total apples now = 17/4 + 3/19
   * To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 76 (4 × 19).
   * 17/4 = 323/76 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 19)
   * 3/19 = 12/76 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 4)
   * 323/76 + 12/76 = 335/76

5. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed fraction:
   * 335/76 = 4 31/76 (divide 335 by 76, which gives 4 with a remainder of 31)

Therefore, Mandy now has a total of 4 31/76 KGs of apples.

   * She swam back 1/12 miles before resting.

2. Calculate the distance Peggy swam back:
   * Distance swam back = 1/12 miles

3. Calculate the remaining distance Peggy needs to swim to reach her family:
   * Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swam back
   * Remaining distance = 5/4 - 1/12
   * To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 12.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining distance Peggy needs to swim to reach her family.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swam back
Remaining distance = 5/4 - 1/15

Step 2: Find a common denominator to subtract the fractions.
The common denominator is 60 (LCM of 4 and 15).

Given:
- The total area of the wheat fields is 4 11/12 acres.
- The additional patch of land where he grows vegetables is 17/11 of an acre.

Step 1: Convert 4 11/12 acres to an improper fraction.
4 11/12 = (4 × 12 + 11) / 12 = 59/12

Step 2: Add the wheat fields area and the vegetable patch area.
Total area = 59/12 + 17/11

Step 3: Find a common denominator for 12 and 11 (which is 132) and add the fractions.
Total area = (59 × 11) / (12 × 11) + (17 × 12) / (11 × 12)

2. One part of the field is 4/9 of an acre (not 4 acres as previously thought).
3. The other part of the field is 11/12 of an acre.
4. To find the total acres used to grow wheat, we need to add the two parts together.

5. To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.
   LCM of 9 and 12 is 36.

6. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator of 36:

   4/9 = (4 × 4)/(9 × 4) = 16/36
   11/12 = (11 × 3)/(12 × 3) = 33/36

7. Now, add the fractions:

   16/36 + 33/36 = 49/36

8. Simplify the fraction 49/36:

   49/36 = 1 13/36 (mixed fraction) ≈ 1.361111... (decimal)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total yards of fabric used, we need to add the yards of red fabric and blue fabric together.

Red fabric: 11/4 yards
Blue fabric: 5/17 yards

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 4 and 17.

LCM(4, 17) = 68

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 68:

11/4 = 11 × 17/4 × 17 = 187/68
5/17 = 5 × 4/17 × 4 = 20/68

Adding the fractions:
187/68 + 20/68 = 207/68

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF):

        If the designer also used an additional 19/10 yards of golden fabric, how many yards of fabric did she use in total now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Now, we need to add the yards of red fabric, blue fabric, and golden fabric together.

Red fabric: 11/4 yards
Blue fabric: 5/17 yards
Golden fabric: 19/10 yards

We already found the sum of red and blue fabric, which is 207/68 yards.

To add 207/68 and 19/10, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 68 and 10.

LCM(68, 10) = 340

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 340:

207/68 = 207 × 5/68 × 5 = 1035/340
19/10 = 19 × 34/10 × 34 = 646/340

Adding the fractions:
1035/340 + 646/340 = 1681/340

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF):

GCF(1681, 340) = 1

Therefore, the fraction 1681/340 cannot be simplified further.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this case, the dress designer used 11/4 yards of red fabric and 5/5 yards of blue fabric.

Red fabric: 11/4 yards
Blue fabric: 5/5 yards

First, let's simplify the fraction 5/5:
5/5 = 1

Now, we need to add 11/4 and 1.

To add a mixed number (11/4) and a whole number (1), we can convert the whole number to a fraction with the same denominator as the mixed number:

1 = 4/4

Adding the fractions:
11/4 + 4/4 = 15/4

To convert the improper fraction 15/4 to a mixed number, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
15 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 3

The mixed number is 3 3/4.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jacob has 11/2 feet long guitar wire.
   * He uses 5/16 feet of the wire to fix a guitar.

2. Convert the mixed fraction 11/2 to an improper fraction:
   * 11/2 = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2
   * So, Jacob has 3/2 feet of guitar wire.

3. Subtract the used wire from the total wire:
   * Remaining wire = Total wire - Used wire
   * Remaining wire = 3/2 - 5/16

4. Find a common denominator to subtract the fractions:
   * The common denominator is 16.
   * 3/2 = 24/16
   * So, 3/2 - 5/16 = 24/16 - 5/16 = 19/16

1. Understand the given information:
   * Samantha has a tube of toothpaste containing 4 fluid ounces.
   * In one week, she uses 17/14 fluid ounces of toothpaste.

2. Convert the mixed number 17/14 to an improper fraction:
   * 17/14 = 1 3/14
   * 1 3/14 = (1 × 14 + 3) / 14 = 17/14

3. Subtract the amount of toothpaste used from the total amount:
   * Remaining toothpaste = Total toothpaste - Used toothpaste
   * Remaining toothpaste = 4 - 17/14
   * To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 14.
   * 4 = 56/14 (because 4 × 14 = 56)
   * Remaining toothpaste = 56/14 - 17/14 = (56 - 17) / 14 = 39/14

4. Simplify the fraction:

Given:
- Samantha has a tube of toothpaste containing 4 fluid ounces.
- In one week, she uses 12/14 fluid ounces of toothpaste.

Step 1: Convert the whole number 4 to an improper fraction with a denominator of 14.
4 = 56/14 (because 4 × 14 = 56)

Step 2: Subtract the amount of toothpaste used from the total amount.
Remaining toothpaste = Total toothpaste - Used toothpaste
Remaining toothpaste = 56/14 - 12/14
Remaining toothpaste = (56 - 12) / 14 = 44/14

Step 3: Simplify the fraction.
44/14 = 3 2/14 (because 44 ÷ 14 = 3 remainder 2)

Therefore, if Samantha had originally started with a 4 fluid ounce tube of toothpaste and only used 12/14 fluid ounces in the first week, she would have 3 2/14 fluid ounces of toothpaste left.

1. First, Jane cuts 10/12 yards of fabric from the blanket.
2. Then, she cuts an additional 10/10 yard.
3. To find the total yards of fabric cut, we need to add these two fractions:

   10/12 + 10/10

4. To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 12 and 10 is 60.
5. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 60:

   10/12 = 50/60 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 5)
   10/10 = 60/60 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 6)

6. Now add the fractions:

   50/60 + 60/60 = 110/60

7. Simplify the result:

   110/60 = 11/6 (divide both numerator and denominator by 10)

1. Jane cuts 10/12 yards, 10/10 yard, and 4/12 yard from the blanket.
2. To find the total yards of fabric cut, we need to add these three fractions:

   10/12 + 10/10 + 4/12

3. First, let's add 10/12 and 4/12 since they have the same denominator:

   10/12 + 4/12 = 14/12

4. Now, we have:

   14/12 + 10/10

5. To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 12 and 10 is 60.
6. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 60:

   14/12 = 70/60 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 5)
   10/10 = 60/60 (multiply both numerator and denominator by 6)

7. Now add the fractions:

   70/60 + 60/60 = 130/60

8. Simplify the result:

   130/60 = 13/6 (divide both numerator and denominator by 10)

9. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:

1. Points for vowels:
   * Each vowel is worth 3/11 of a point.
   * You used 1 vowel.
   * Points for vowels = 1 × 3/11 = 3/11

2. Points for consonants:
   * Each consonant is worth 8/10 of a point.
   * You used 1 consonant.
   * Points for consonants = 1 × 8/10 = 8/10

3. Total score:
   * Total score = Points for vowels + Points for consonants
   * Total score = 3/11 + 8/10
   * To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 110 (LCM of 11 and 10).
   * 3/11 = 30/110 (multiply numerator and denominator by 10)

        You are writing a letter that is 4/1 pages long. You remove 14/9 pages from it. How many pages is the letter now?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's approach this step by step:

1) First, we need to understand what the question is asking. We start with a letter that is 4/1 pages long, and we remove 14/9 pages from it. We need to find out how many pages are left.

2) To solve this, we need to subtract the number of pages removed from the original number of pages.

   4/1 - 14/9

3) However, we can't subtract fractions with different denominators. We need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 9.

4) To convert 4/1 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 9, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 9:

   4/1 = (4 × 9)/(1 × 9) = 36/9

5) Now we can perform the subtraction:

   36/9 - 14/9 = (36 - 14)/9 = 22/9

6) Therefore, after removing 14/9 pages, the letter is now 22/9 pages long.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off. The letter is currently 22/9 pages long, and we want to add 7/12 of a page to it.

1) To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 9 and 12 is 36 (the least common multiple).

2) Let's convert 22/9 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 36:

   22/9 = (22 × 4)/(9 × 4) = 88/36

3) Now let's convert 7/12 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 36:

   7/12 = (7 × 3)/(12 × 3) = 21/36

4) Now we can add the fractions:

   88/36 + 21/36 = (88 + 21)/36 = 109/36

5) We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 109 and 36 is 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

6) Therefore, after adding 7/12 of a page, the letter is now 109/36 pages long.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same approach as before.

Given:
- The original letter is 15/1 pages long.
- You remove 14/9 pages from the letter.

Step 1: Convert 15/1 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 9.
15/1 = (15 × 9)/(1 × 9) = 135/9

Step 2: Subtract the number of pages removed from the original number of pages.
135/9 - 14/9 = (135 - 14)/9 = 121/9

Step 3: Simplify the fraction if possible.
121/9 cannot be simplified further as the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.

Therefore, after removing 14/9 pages from a 15/1-page letter, the letter is now 121/9 pages long.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Anne painted 16/20 of the table.
2. Bob painted an additional 5/20 of the table.
3. To find the total amount of the table that has been painted, we need to add the fractions:

   16/20 + 5/20 = (16 + 5)/20 = 21/20

4. Now, let's simplify the fraction 21/20:
   
   21/20 = 1 1/20 (because 20/20 = 1, and 1/20 remains)

5. This means that the total amount of the table painted is 1 whole table plus 1/20 of a table.

Therefore, in total, 1 1/20 of the table has been painted.

        After Anne and Bob painted parts of the table, Carl decided to add to their work by painting another 11/5 of the table. Now, how much of the table has been painted in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's continue from where we left off in the previous problem:

1. Anne and Bob had already painted 1 1/20 of the table.
2. Carl painted an additional 11/5 of the table.
3. To find the new total amount of the table that has been painted, we need to add the fractions:

   1 1/20 + 11/5

4. First, let's convert 1 1/20 to an improper fraction:
   
   1 1/20 = 20/20 + 1/20 = 21/20

5. Now, we can add 21/20 and 11/5:

   21/20 + 11/5
   
   To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 5 is 20. So, we'll convert 11/5 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 20:
   
   11/5 = (11 × 4)/(5 × 4) = 44/20

   Now, we can add the fractions:
   
   21/20 + 44/20 = (21 + 44)/20 = 65/20

6. Let's simplify the fraction 65/20:
   
   65/20 = 3 5/20 (because 60/20 = 3, and 5/20 remains)

Therefore, after Carl's contribution, a total of 3 5/20 of the table has been painted.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Anne painted 16/20 of the table.
2. In this case, Bob painted 5/14 of the table.
3. To find the total amount of the table that has been painted, we need to add these fractions. However, we can't add fractions with different denominators directly. We need to find a common denominator first.
4. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 14.
   LCM(20, 14) = 140
5. Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 140:
   
   16/20 = (16 × 7)/(20 × 7) = 112/140
   5/14 = (5 × 10)/(14 × 10) = 50/140

6. Now we can add the fractions:

   112/140 + 50/140 = 162/140

7. Let's simplify this fraction:
   
   162/140 = 1 22/140 (because 140/140 = 1, and 22/140 remains)
   
   Simplifying further: 22/140 = 11/70

Therefore, in this case, Anne and Bob together have painted 1 11/70 of the table.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the total relative brightness of Alpha and Bravo compared to an average star.

Given:
- Alpha shines 17/3 times brighter than an average star.
- Bravo shines 20/16 times as bright as an average star.

Step 1: Add the relative brightness of Alpha and Bravo.
Total relative brightness = Alpha's brightness + Bravo's brightness
Total relative brightness = 17/3 + 20/16

Step 2: Simplify the fractions by finding a common denominator.
The common denominator is 48 (the least common multiple of 3 and 16).

Alpha's brightness = 17/3 × 16/16 = 272/48
Bravo's brightness = 20/16 × 3/3 = 60/48

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
Total relative brightness = 272/48 + 60/48 = 332/48

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction.
Total relative brightness = 332/48 = 83/12

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same steps as before, but with the adjusted brightness of star Alpha.

Given:
- Alpha now shines 8/3 times brighter than an average star (adjusted from 17/3).
- Bravo still shines 20/16 times as bright as an average star.

Step 1: Add the relative brightness of Alpha and Bravo.
Total relative brightness = Alpha's brightness + Bravo's brightness
Total relative brightness = 8/3 + 20/16

Step 2: Simplify the fractions by finding a common denominator.
The common denominator is 48 (the least common multiple of 3 and 16).

Alpha's brightness = 8/3 × 16/16 = 128/48
Bravo's brightness = 20/16 × 3/3 = 60/48

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
Total relative brightness = 128/48 + 60/48 = 188/48

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction.
Total relative brightness = 188/48 = 47/12

Therefore, with the adjusted brightness of star Alpha, Alpha and Bravo together shine 47/12 times brighter than an average star.

- In the first two hours, the shark swam a total of 2 14/15 miles.
- In the third hour, the shark swam 14/9 miles.

Step 1: Convert 2 14/15 miles to an improper fraction.
2 14/15 = (2 × 15 + 14) / 15 = 44/15 miles

Step 2: Add the distance covered in the third hour to the total distance from the first two hours.
Total distance = Distance in first two hours + Distance in third hour
Total distance = 44/15 + 14/9

Step 3: Find a common denominator for 44/15 and 14/9 (LCM of 15 and 9 is 45).
44/15 = 44/15 × 3/3 = 132/45
14/9 = 14/9 × 5/5 = 70/45

Step 4: Add the fractions.
Total distance = 132/45 + 70/45 = 202/45

Step 5: Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number.
202/45 = 4 22/45 = 4 4/9 miles

Therefore, the shark swam a total of 4 4/9 miles in these three hours.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. In the first hour, the shark swims 3/7 miles.

2. In the second hour, the shark swims 13/5 miles.
   13/5 = 2 3/5 miles

3. To find the total distance the shark swims, we need to add the distances from both hours:
   3/7 + 2 3/5
   = 3/7 + 13/5
   = 15/35 + 91/35
   = 106/35

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. The first beat is hit every 17/17 seconds. This simplifies to 1 second.

2. The second beat is hit every 2/12 seconds. This can be simplified:
   2/12 = 1/6 seconds

3. To find the total time for the two beats together, we add the time for each beat:
   1 + 1/6 seconds

4. To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 6:

Given:
- The fireplace burns 12/17 cord of wood in the morning.
- The fireplace burns 8/19 cord of wood in the evening.

Step 1: Find a common denominator for 12/17 and 8/19.
The common denominator is 17 × 19 = 323.

Step 2: Convert 12/17 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 323.
12/17 × 19/19 = 228/323

Step 3: Convert 8/19 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 323.
8/19 × 17/17 = 136/323

Step 4: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
228/323 + 136/323 = 364/323

Step 5: Simplify the resulting fraction.
364/323 cannot be simplified further as the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.

Step 1: Find a common denominator for 364/323 and 19/20.
The common denominator is 323 × 20 = 6460.

Step 2: Convert 364/323 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 6460.
364/323 × 20/20 = 7280/6460

Step 3: Convert 19/20 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 6460.

The common denominator is 19 × 17 = 323.

First segment: 18/19 = (18 × 17) / (19 × 17) = 306/323
Second segment: 9/17 = (9 × 19) / (17 × 19) = 171/323

Step 2: Add the fractions.
Total flight length = 306/323 + 171/323 = (306 + 171) / 323 = 477/323

Step 3: Simplify the fraction.
477/323 cannot be simplified further as there are no common factors between 477 and 323.

Given:
- The first segment was 18/19 of a mile.
- The second segment was 9/17 of a mile.
- The third segment is 19/20 of a mile.

From the previous calculation, we found that the total distance of the first two segments was 477/323 of a mile.

Step 1: Convert 19/20 to a fraction with a denominator of 323.
19/20 = (19 × 323) / (20 × 323) = 6137/6460

Step 2: Add the distance of the third segment to the total distance of the first two segments.
Total flight length = 477/323 + 6137/6460

To add these fractions, we need to convert them to a common denominator.
The common denominator is 323 × 6460 = 2,086,580.

477/323 = (477 × 6460) / (323 × 6460) = 3,081,020/2,086,580
6137/6460 = (6137 × 323) / (6460 × 323) = 1,982,251/2,086,580

Total flight length = 3,081,020/2,086,580 + 1,982,251/2,086,580
                   = (3,081,020 + 1,982,251) / 2,086,580
                   = 5,063,271/2,086,580

Step 3: Simplify the fraction.
5,063,271/2,086,580 cannot be simplified further as there are no common factors between 5,063,271 and 2,086,580.

Therefore, the total distance the butterfly has flown is 5,063,271/2,086,580 of a mile.

Given:
- The first segment was 18/12 of a mile (instead of 18/19).
- The second segment was 9/17 of a mile.

Step 1: Simplify the fraction for the first segment.
First segment: 18/12 = 3/2 miles

Step 2: Convert the fractions to a common denominator.
The common denominator is 2 × 17 = 34.

First segment: 3/2 = (3 × 17) / (2 × 17) = 51/34 miles
Second segment: 9/17 = (9 × 2) / (17 × 2) = 18/34 miles

Step 3: Add the fractions.
Total flight length = 51/34 + 18/34 = (51 + 18) / 34 = 69/34 miles

Step 4: Simplify the fraction.
69/34 cannot be simplified further as there are no common factors between 69 and 34.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The distance between the first and second city is 13/10 inches.

2. To find the total distance, we need to add the two distances:
   * Total distance = Distance from 1st to 2nd city + Distance from 2nd to 3rd city
   * Total distance = 13/10 + 14/15

   * 14/15 = (14 × 7)/(15 × 7) = 98/105

5. Now add the fractions:

6. Simplify the fraction if possible:
   * 293/105 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 7.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The balloon initially rises at a rate of 13/6 feet per second.
   * After a gust of wind, the speed increases by 3/16 feet per second.

2. To find the new speed, we need to add the initial speed and the increase in speed:
   * New speed = Initial speed + Increase in speed
   * New speed = 13/6 + 3/16

3. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 16, which is 48.

4. Convert 13/6 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 48:

6. Add the fractions:
   * New speed = 104/48 + 9/48 = (104 + 9)/48 = 113/48

7. Simplify the fraction if possible:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We know that the new speed of each balloon is 113/48 feet per second.

Given:
- There are two identical helium balloons rising at the same speed.

Total combined speed = Speed of balloon 1 + Speed of balloon 2
Total combined speed = 113/48 + 113/48

226/48 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 226 and 48 is 2.
Total combined speed = (226 ÷ 2)/(48 ÷ 2)
Total combined speed = 113/24

Therefore, the total combined speed of the two identical helium balloons is 113/24 feet per second.

        Scarlett has 16/10 gallons of red paint. If she uses 1/20 of a gallon for a small art project, how many gallons of red paint will she have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Scarlett has 16/10 gallons of red paint.
   * She uses 1/20 of a gallon for a small art project.

2. Convert 16/10 gallons to a mixed number:
   * 16/10 = 1 6/10 = 1 3/5 gallons

3. Subtract the used paint (1/20 gallon) from the total paint (1 3/5 gallons):
   * First, convert 1 3/5 gallons to an improper fraction:
     * 1 3/5 = (1 × 5 + 3) / 5 = 8/5 gallons
   * Now, subtract 1/20 from 8/5:
     * 8/5 - 1/20 = (8 × 4 - 1 × 1) / (5 × 4) = 31/20 gallons

4. Convert 31/20 gallons to a mixed number:
   * 31/20 = 1 11/20 gallons

Therefore, Scarlett will have 1 11/20 gallons of red paint left after using 1/20 of a gallon for her small art project.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off in the previous problem. We know that Scarlett has 1 11/20 gallons of red paint left, and she wants to mix it with 5/7 gallons of yellow paint.

1. Convert 1 11/20 gallons (red paint) to an improper fraction:
   * 1 11/20 = (1 × 20 + 11) / 20 = 31/20 gallons

2. Add the red paint (31/20 gallons) and the yellow paint (5/7 gallons):
   * To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.
   * LCM of 20 and 7 is 140.
   * Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 140:
     * 31/20 = (31 × 7) / (20 × 7) = 217/140 gallons
     * 5/7 = (5 × 20) / (7 × 20) = 100/140 gallons
   * Now, add the fractions:
     * 217/140 + 100/140 = (217 + 100) / 140 = 317/140 gallons

3. Convert 317/140 gallons to a mixed number:
   * 317/140 = 2 37/140 gallons

Therefore, after mixing the remaining red paint with 5/7 gallons of yellow paint, Scarlett now has 2 37/140 gallons of orange paint.

2. Convert 16/10 gallons to a mixed number:
   * 16/10 = 1 6/10 = 1 3/5 gallons

3. Simplify 2/20 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their common factor, 2:
   * 2/20 = 1/10 gallon

4. Subtract the used paint (1/10 gallon) from the total paint (1 3/5 gallons):

   * She eats 2/5 of a chocolate bar.

2. Calculate the number of chocolate bars Susie ate:
   * 2/5 of a chocolate bar = 0.4 chocolate bars
   * Since we can't have a fraction of a chocolate bar left in the box, we round up to 1 chocolate bar.
   * Susie ate 1 chocolate bar.

3. Calculate the number of chocolate bars left in the box:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The plane is initially flying at an altitude of 2 miles.
   * It descends by 10/15 of a mile.

2. Convert the fraction 10/15 to a decimal for easier calculation:
   * 10 ÷ 15 = 0.6666... ≈ 0.67 miles

3. Subtract the descent distance from the initial altitude:
   * New altitude = Initial altitude - Descent distance
   * New altitude = 2 miles - 0.67 miles
   * New altitude = 1.33 miles

Therefore, after descending by 10/15 of a mile, the plane's new altitude is 1.33 miles.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total meters the child slid, we need to add the lengths of the two slides.

1. Length of the first slide: 6/19 meters
2. Length of the second slide: 17/4 meters

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 19 and 4.

LCM(19, 4) = 76

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 76:

6/19 = (6 × 4)/(19 × 4) = 24/76
17/4 = (17 × 19)/(4 × 19) = 323/76

Adding the fractions:
24/76 + 323/76 = 347/76

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD):

GCD(347, 76) = 1

Since the GCD is 1, the fraction 347/76 is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the total meters the child slid is 347/76 meters.

1. Length of the first slide: 6/5 meters
2. Length of the second slide: 17/4 meters

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 5 and 4.

LCM(5, 4) = 20

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 20:

6/5 = (6 × 4)/(5 × 4) = 24/20
17/4 = (17 × 5)/(4 × 5) = 85/20

Adding the fractions:
24/20 + 85/20 = 109/20

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD):

GCD(109, 20) = 1

Since the GCD is 1, the fraction 109/20 is already in its simplest form.

To convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * In the early morning, the fireplace burns 4/15 cords of firewood per hour.
   * In the late night, the fireplace burns 14/15 cords of firewood per hour.
   * We need to find the total amount of firewood burned in one hour, split between early morning and late night.

2. Assume the hour is split evenly between early morning and late night. So, the fireplace burns at the early morning rate for 1/2 hour and at the late night rate for 1/2 hour.

3. Calculate the amount of firewood burned in the early morning:
   * Early morning rate = 4/15 cords per hour
   * Time at early morning rate = 1/2 hour
   * Firewood burned in early morning = 4/15 × 1/2 = 2/15 cords

4. Calculate the amount of firewood burned in the late night:
   * Late night rate = 14/15 cords per hour
   * Time at late night rate = 1/2 hour
   * Firewood burned in late night = 14/15 × 1/2 = 7/15 cords

5. Sum up the total amount of firewood burned in the hour:
   * Total firewood burned = Early morning + Late night
   * Total firewood burned = 2/15 + 7/15 = 9/15 cords

Therefore, the fireplace burns a total of 9/15 cords of firewood in one hour split between the early morning and late night.

1. The alien first traveled 9/20 of a light year.

3. To find the total distance traveled, we need to add these two distances:

   9/20 + 11/7 = (9 × 7)/(20 × 7) + (11 × 20)/(7 × 20)
               = 63/140 + 220/140
               = (63 + 220)/140

2. Now, the alien continues its journey for an additional 14/2 light years.

Given:
- The alien originally traveled (9/20) + (11/7) light years.

Step 1: Simplify the fraction 11/11.
11/11 = 1

Step 2: Add the fractions (9/20) and 1.
(9/20) + 1 = (9/20) + (20/20) = (9 + 20)/20 = 29/20

Step 3: Simplify the fraction 29/20 if possible.
The greatest common factor (GCF) of 29 and 20 is 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Bob has 10/2 of a cucumber. Simplify this fraction:
   10/2 = 5 cucumbers

2. Bob adds 1/7 of another cucumber to the 5 cucumbers he already has:
   5 + 1/7 cucumbers

3. To add fractions, we need a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 7:
   5 = 35/7 (because 5 × 7/7 = 35/7)
   
   So, 5 + 1/7 = 35/7 + 1/7 = 36/7 cucumbers

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Bob initially has 17/7 cucumbers.

2. He adds 10/2 of a cucumber to the 17/7 cucumbers he already has:
   17/7 + 10/2 cucumbers

3. Simplify 10/2:
   10/2 = 5 cucumbers

4. Now, we have:
   17/7 + 5 cucumbers

5. To add fractions, we need a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 7:
   5 = 35/7 (because 5 × 7/7 = 35/7)
   
   So, 17/7 + 5 = 17/7 + 35/7 = 52/7 cucumbers

6. Simplify the result:
   52/7 = 7 3/7 cucumbers (because 52 ÷ 7 = 7 remainder 3)

Therefore, after adding 10/2 of a cucumber to his initial 17/7 cucumbers, Bob now has 7 3/7 cucumbers in total.

### Answer: 7 3/7 cucumbers</pre>
