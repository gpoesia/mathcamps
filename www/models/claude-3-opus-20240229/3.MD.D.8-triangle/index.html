    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) In an equilateral triangle, all sides have the same length. Let's call this length $x$.

2) The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 990cm.

3) So, we can write an equation:

   $x + x + x = 990$
   
   or simplify to:
   
   $3x = 990$

4) To find $x$, we divide both sides by 3:

   $x = 990 \div 3 = 330$

Therefore, each side of the equilateral triangle is 330cm long.

3) Simplify the left side of the equation:
   669 + x = 997

4) Subtract 669 from both sides:
   x = 997 - 669
   x = 328

Therefore, the length of the third side is 328m.

   - One side is 223 meters long.
   - Another side is 46 meters long.

3. We can set up an equation:
   - Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3
   - 503 = 223 + 46 + x

4. Solve for x:
   - 503 = 269 + x

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Yes, we can find the length of the third side using the given information. Let's solve this step by step.

Given:
- The perimeter of the triangle is 861m.
- Two sides of the triangle are 192m and 159m.

To find the length of the third side, we can subtract the sum of the two known sides from the perimeter.

Step 1: Add the lengths of the two known sides.
192m + 159m = 351m

Step 2: Subtract the sum of the two known sides from the perimeter to find the length of the third side.
861m - 351m = 510m

Therefore, the length of the third side is 510m.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) In a triangle with equal sides, each side is one-third of the perimeter. This is because the perimeter is the sum of all three sides.

2) We can represent this mathematically:
   
   Let the length of each side be x.
   Then, 3x = 489 (because x + x + x = 489)

3) To find x, we divide both sides by 3:

   x = 489 ÷ 3
   x = 163

Therefore, the length of each side of the triangle is 163 centimeters.

   $x + x + x = 696$
   
   $3x = 696$

3) To find the length of each side, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

3. We can set up an equation:
   - Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3
   - 804 = 180 + 579 + x

4. Now, let's solve for x:

        A triangle has a total perimeter of 898m. The lengths of two of its sides are 250m and 435m respectively. Can you find the length of the third side of the triangle?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the third side of the triangle, we can use the given information:
* The perimeter of the triangle is 898m.
* Two sides of the triangle have lengths of 250m and 435m.

We know that the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Let's call the unknown length of the third side x.

Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3
898 = 250 + 435 + x

To find x, we subtract the sum of the known sides from the perimeter:
x = 898 - (250 + 435)
x = 898 - 685
x = &lt;&lt;898-685=213&gt;&gt;213

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 213m.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of the equilateral triangle, we can use the following reasoning:

1. In an equilateral triangle, all sides have equal length. Let's call the length of each side x.
2. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 405 cm.
3. We can write an equation: x + x + x = 405 (since all three sides are equal)
4. Simplify the equation: 3x = 405
5. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 405 ÷ 3
6. Calculate: x = 135

Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 135 cm.

1) In an equilateral triangle, all sides have the same length. Let's call the length of each side $x$.

2) The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 612 meters. So we can write:

   $x + x + x = 612$
   
   or 
   
   $3x = 612$

3) To find the length of each side, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of an equilateral triangle, we need to divide the perimeter by the number of sides.

Given:
- The triangle is equilateral, which means all sides have equal length.
- The perimeter of the triangle is 591 cm.

Step 1: Determine the number of sides in an equilateral triangle.
An equilateral triangle has 3 sides.

Step 2: Divide the perimeter by the number of sides to find the length of each side.
Length of each side = Perimeter ÷ Number of sides
Length of each side = 591 cm ÷ 3
Length of each side = &lt;&lt;591/3=197&gt;&gt;197 cm

Therefore, each side of the equilateral triangle is 197 cm long.

3) So, we can write an equation:

   $x + x + x = 858$
   
   $3x = 858$

4) To find $x$, we divide both sides by 3:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's use the following information:
- The triangle is an equilateral triangle, which means all three sides have the same length.
- The perimeter of the triangle is 513 km.

Let's call the length of each side of the triangle &quot;x&quot;.

Since the perimeter is the sum of all sides, and all sides are equal, we can write:
x + x + x = 513

Simplifying the equation:
3x = 513

To find the length of each side, divide both sides by 3:

3. Let's call the length of the third side x meters.

4. Since the sum of all sides is equal to the perimeter, we can write an equation:

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) In an equilateral triangle, all sides have the same length. Let's call the length of each side $x$.

2) The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 936m. Therefore:

   $x + x + x = 936$
   
   $3x = 936$

3) To find the length of each side, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

   $x = 936 ÷ 3$
   
   $x = 312$

Therefore, each side of the equilateral triangle is 312 meters long.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Let's call the unknown side length x.

2. Given:
   - Perimeter of the triangle = 721m
   - Length of one side = 204m
   - Length of another side = 195m

3. We can write an equation:
   204m + 195m + x = 721m

4. Simplify the equation:
   399m + x = 721m

5. Subtract 399m from both sides:
   x = 721m - 399m
   x = 322m

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 322m.

3) To find the length of each side, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

   $x = 486 \div 3$
   
   $x = 162$

Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 162 cm.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) In an equilateral triangle, all sides have the same length. Let's call the length of each side $x$.

2) The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 948 meters. Therefore:

   $x + x + x = 948$
   
   $3x = 948$

3) To find the length of each side, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

   $3x/3 = 948/3$
   
   $x = 316$

Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 316 meters.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the third side, we can use the given information about the perimeter and the lengths of the first two sides.

Given:
- The triangle is scalene, meaning all three sides have different lengths.
- The first side is 252m long.
- The second side is 687m long.
- The total perimeter of the triangle is 998m.

To find the length of the third side, we can subtract the sum of the first two sides from the total perimeter.

Length of the third side = Total perimeter - (Length of the first side + Length of the second side)
Length of the third side = 998m - (252m + 687m)
Length of the third side = 998m - 939m
Length of the third side = 59m

Therefore, the length of the third side is 59m.

1) In an equilateral triangle, all sides have the same length. Let's call this length $x$.

2) The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 618m.

3) Since all sides are equal, we can express the perimeter as:

   Perimeter = $x + x + x$ = $3x$

4) We are told that the perimeter is 618m. So:

   $3x = 618$

5) To find $x$, we divide both sides by 3:

   $x = 618 ÷ 3 = 206$

        The perimeter of a triangle is 934m. The lengths of two of its sides add up to 838m (one is 828m and the other is 10m). What is the length of the third side?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the perimeter of the triangle is 934m. This means that the sum of all three sides is 934m.

2. We also know that two of the sides have lengths of 828m and 10m, which add up to 838m.

3. To find the length of the third side, we can subtract the sum of the two known sides from the perimeter:

   Third side length = Perimeter - (Length of side 1 + Length of side 2)
                     = 934m - (828m + 10m)
                     = 934m - 838m
                     = 96m

Therefore, the length of the third side is 96m.

Step 1: Let's define the length of the third side as x.

Step 2: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides. So, we can write an equation:
122 + 245 + x = 762

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
122 + 245 + x = 762

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) In an equilateral triangle, all sides have the same length. Let's call this length $x$.

2) The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 966m.

3) Since all sides are equal, we can express the perimeter as:

   $3x = 966$

4) To find the length of each side, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

   $x = 966 \div 3 = 322$

Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 322m.

### Answer: 322m</pre>
