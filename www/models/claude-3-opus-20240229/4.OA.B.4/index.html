Factors of 64:

2 x 32 = 64
4 x 16 = 64
8 x 8 = 64

Since we have already found the pair 8 x 8, all other factor pairs will be duplicates of the ones we have already found.

Therefore, the factor pairs of 64 are:
(1, 64)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find all the factor pairs of 16, let's find all the numbers that divide evenly into 16.

Factors of 16:
1 × 16 = 16
2 × 8 = 16
4 × 4 = 16

Therefore, the factor pairs of 16 are:
(1, 16)
(2, 8)
(4, 4)

Note that (4, 4) is a factor pair because 4 is a factor of 16 twice.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the factor pairs of 94, we need to find all pairs of integers that, when multiplied together, result in 94.

Factors of 94:
1 x 94 = 94
2 x 47 = 94

Since 94 is an even number, we can check if it's divisible by other even numbers like 4 and 6.

4 is not a factor of 94 because 94 ÷ 4 = 23.5, which is not an integer.
6 is not a factor of 94 because 94 ÷ 6 = 15.666..., which is not an integer.

We can also check if 94 is divisible by prime numbers like 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.

3 is not a factor of 94 because 94 ÷ 3 = 31.333..., which is not an integer.
5 is not a factor of 94 because 94 ÷ 5 = 18.8, which is not an integer.
7 is not a factor of 94 because 94 ÷ 7 = 13.428..., which is not an integer.
11 is not a factor of 94 because 94 ÷ 11 = 8.545..., which is not an integer.

Since we have checked all possible factors up to the square root of 94 (which is approximately 9.7), we can conclude that there are no more factor pairs.

Therefore, the factor pairs of 94 are:
1 and 94
2 and 47

Let's start with the smallest possible factor pair and work our way up:

Since 83 is a prime number, it has no other factors besides 1 and itself.

Therefore, the only factor pair for 83 is:
(1, 83)

Let's start with the smallest possible factor pair and work our way up:

1 x 61 = 61

Since 61 is a prime number, it has no other factors besides 1 and itself.

Therefore, the only factor pair of 61 is:
(1, 61)

        What are all of the factor pairs of 86?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find all the factor pairs of 86, let's find all the numbers that divide evenly into 86.

Factors of 86:
1 x 86 = 86
2 x 43 = 86

Since 86 is an even number, let's check if it's divisible by other even numbers like 4 and 6.

86 ÷ 4 = 21 remainder 2, so 4 is not a factor of 86.
86 ÷ 6 = 14 remainder 2, so 6 is not a factor of 86.

Let's also check if it's divisible by prime numbers less than its square root (√86 ≈ 9.27).

86 ÷ 3 = 28 remainder 2, so 3 is not a factor of 86.
86 ÷ 5 = 17 remainder 1, so 5 is not a factor of 86.
86 ÷ 7 = 12 remainder 2, so 7 is not a factor of 86.

Therefore, the factor pairs of 86 are:
1 and 86
2 and 43

        Identify all the distinct pairs of factors that can multiply to give the number 93.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

1) First, let's find all the factors of 93. To do this, we can divide 93 by each number from 1 to 93 and see which divisions result in a whole number.

   1 is a factor of 93 because 93 ÷ 1 = 93
   3 is a factor of 93 because 93 ÷ 3 = 31
   31 is a factor of 93 because 93 ÷ 31 = 3
   93 is a factor of 93 because 93 ÷ 93 = 1

   So, the factors of 93 are 1, 3, 31, and 93.

2) Now, let's make pairs of these factors. Remember, order doesn't matter in multiplication, so (1, 93) is the same as (93, 1).

   (1, 93)
   (3, 31)

3) Therefore, there are 2 distinct pairs of factors that can multiply to give 93: (1, 93) and (3, 31).
