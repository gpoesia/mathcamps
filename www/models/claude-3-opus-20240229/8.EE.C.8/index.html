        Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other using the second equation, and then substitute it into the first equation.

From the second equation, let's solve for s in terms of q:
(30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121
30s = 121 - 12q
s = (121 - 12q) / 30
s = 121/30 - 12q/30
s = 121/30 - 2q/5
&lt;&lt;121/30=121/30=121/30=4.033333333333333&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;12/30=12/30=2/5=0.4&gt;&gt;
s = 4.033333333333333 - 0.4q

Now, substitute this expression for s into the first equation:
(40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
40 * (4.033333333333333 - 0.4q) - 91q = 37
161.33333333333333 - 16q - 91q = 37
161.33333333333333 - 107q = 37
-107q = -124.33333333333333
&lt;&lt;-124.33333333333333/-107=-124.33333333333333/-107=1.162790697674419&gt;&gt;
q = 1.162790697674419

Now that we have the value of q, we can substitute it back into the equation for s:
s = 4.033333333333333 - 0.4q
s = 4.033333333333333 - 0.4 * 1.162790697674419
&lt;&lt;4.033333333333333-0.4*1.162790697674419=4.033333333333333-0.465116279069767=3.568217054263566&gt;&gt;
s = 3.568217054263566

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:
q ≈ 1.163 (rounded to 3 decimal places)
s ≈ 3.568 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other using the first equation, then substitute it into the second equation to solve for the remaining variable.

Given equations:
1. 4b + 44m = 180
2. 79m - 6b = 48

Step 1: Solve for b in terms of m using equation 1.
4b + 44m = 180
4b = 180 - 44m
b = (180 - 44m) ÷ 4
b = 45 - 11m

Step 2: Substitute the expression for b into equation 2.
79m - 6(45 - 11m) = 48
79m - 270 + 66m = 48
145m - 270 = 48
145m = 318
m = 318 ÷ 145
&lt;&lt;145m = 318
m = 318 ÷ 145
m = 2.19310344827586&gt;&gt;m ≈ 2.19

Step 3: Substitute the value of m into the expression for b from step 1.
b = 45 - 11m
b = 45 - 11(2.19)
b = 45 - 24.09
&lt;&lt;b = 45 - 11(2.19)
b = 45 - 24.09
b = 20.91&gt;&gt;b ≈ 20.91

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:
m ≈ 2.19
b ≈ 20.91

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.

From the first equation, let's solve for o:
42 * o - 15 * g = 28
42 * o = 28 + 15 * g
o = (28 + 15 * g) / 42
o = (2 * g) / 3 + 2 / 3

Now, substitute the expression for o into the second equation:
47 * ((2 * g) / 3 + 2 / 3) + 29 * g = 141
(94 * g) / 3 + 94 / 3 + 29 * g = 141
(94 * g) / 3 + 29 * g = 141 - 94 / 3
(94 * g) / 3 + 29 * g = 423 / 3 - 94 / 3
(94 * g) / 3 + 29 * g = 329 / 3
(94 * g + 87 * g) / 3 = 329 / 3
181 * g / 3 = 329 / 3
181 * g = 329
g = 329 / 181
g = 1.81767955801105

Now that we have the value of g, we can substitute it back into the expression for o:
o = (2 * 1.81767955801105) / 3 + 2 / 3
o = 3.63535911602209 / 3 + 2 / 3
o = 1.21178637200736 + 0.66666666666667
o = 1.87845303867403

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:

First equation: ((12 * v) - (6 * o)) = 21
12v - 6o = 21
12v = 21 + 6o
v = (21 + 6o) / 12
v = (7/4) + (o/2) ... (1)

Now, substitute (1) into the second equation:
((76 * v) - (45 * o)) = 50
76 * ((7/4) + (o/2)) - 45o = 50
133 + 38o - 45o = 50
133 - 7o = 50
-7o = -83
o = 83/7
o = 11.857... ≈ 11.86

Now that we have the value of o, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find v:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method.

1. Solve the first equation for f in terms of g:
   75 * f + 25 * g = 138
   75 * f = 138 - 25 * g
   f = (138 - 25 * g) / 75
   f = (138 - 25 * g) / 75 = &lt;&lt;(138 - 25 * g) / 75 = (138/75) - (25/75)*g&gt;&gt;  (138/75) - (25/75)*g

2. Substitute the expression for f into the second equation:
   2 * f + 90 * g = 143
   2 * ((138/75) - (25/75)*g) + 90 * g = 143
   (276/75) - (50/75)*g + 90 * g = 143
   (276/75) + (6750/75)*g - (50/75)*g = 143
   (276/75) + (6700/75)*g = 143

3. Solve the equation for g:
   (276/75) + (6700/75)*g = 143
   (6700/75)*g = 143 - (276/75)
   (6700/75)*g = (10725/75) - (276/75) = &lt;&lt;(10725/75) - (276/75) = 10449/75&gt;&gt;10449/75
   g = (10449/75) / (6700/75)
   g = &lt;&lt;(10449/75) / (6700/75) = 10449/6700&gt;&gt;10449/6700

4. Substitute the value of g into the expression for f:
   f = (138/75) - (25/75)*g
   f = (138/75) - (25/75)*(10449/6700)
   f = (138/75) - (261225/502500) = &lt;&lt;(138/75) - (261225/502500) = (69000/502500) - (261225/502500) = -192225/502500&gt;&gt;-192225/502500

First equation: 194 = 4y + 14n
194 - 14n = 4y
(194 - 14n) / 4 = y
y = (194 - 14n) / 4 ... (1)

Second equation: 7 = 65n - 79y

Substitute (1) into the second equation:
7 = 65n - 79((194 - 14n) / 4)
7 = 65n - 79(194 - 14n) / 4
7 = 65n - (15286 - 1106n) / 4
28 = 260n - 15286 + 1106n
28 = 1366n - 15286
15314 = 1366n
n = 15314 / 1366

        Find the values of l and g that satisfy these two equations: 
The first equation is 146 = 28 * g + 26 * l.
The second equation is 6 = 41 * l - 53 * g.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve for l and g, we can use substitution or elimination methods. Let's use the substitution method here.

From the second equation, we can express l in terms of g:
6 = 41 * l - 53 * g
41 * l = 53 * g + 6
l = (53 * g + 6) / 41

Now, substitute this expression for l into the first equation:
146 = 28 * g + 26 * ((53 * g + 6) / 41)

Simplify:
146 = 28 * g + (1378 * g + 156) / 41
146 = 28 * g + (1378 * g) / 41 + 156 / 41
146 = 28 * g + 33.6097560976 * g + 3.8048780488
146 = 61.6097560976 * g + 3.8048780488

Subtract 3.8048780488 from both sides:
142.1951219512 = 61.6097560976 * g

Divide both sides by 61.6097560976:
g = 142.1951219512 / 61.6097560976
g ≈ 2.3081395348

Now that we have the value of g, we can substitute it back into the expression for l:
l = (53 * 2.3081395348 + 6) / 41
l ≈ 3.0000000001

Therefore, the values of l and g that satisfy the given equations are approximately:

From equation 1, solve for y:
20 * p + 56 * y = 90
56 * y = 90 - 20 * p
y = (90 - 20 * p) / 56
y = 45/28 - (5/14) * p

Substitute the expression for y into equation 2:
89 * p + 7 * (45/28 - (5/14) * p) = 98
89 * p + 315/28 - 35/14 * p = 98
89 * p - 35/14 * p = 98 - 315/28
(89 - 35/14) * p = 98 - 315/28
(1246/14 - 35/14) * p = 98 - 315/28
(1211/14) * p = 98 - 315/28
1211 * p = 1372 - 315
1211 * p = 1057
p = 1057/1211

Substitute p = 1057/1211 into the expression for y:
y = 45/28 - (5/14) * (1057/1211)
y = 45/28 - 5285/16954
y = 12135/16954 - 5285/16954

432*k - 102 + 1518*k = 2112
1950*k - 102 = 2112
1950*k = 2214
k = 2214 / 1950
k = &lt;&lt;2214/1950=1.135384615384615&gt;&gt;1.135384615384615

Step 3: Substitute the value of k into the expression for d.
d = (72*k - 17) / 22
d = (72 * 1.135384615384615 - 17) / 22
d = (81.74769230769231 - 17) / 22
d = 64.74769230769231 / 22
d = &lt;&lt;64.74769230769231/22=2.943076923076923&gt;&gt;2.943076923076923

Therefore, the values of the variables are:
k ≈ 1.135384615384615
d ≈ 2.943076923076923

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other using the first equation, then substitute it into the second equation to solve for the remaining variable.

Given equations:
73 * h - 33 * d = 48
10 * d + 14 * h = 91

Step 1: Solve the first equation for h in terms of d.
73 * h - 33 * d = 48
73 * h = 33 * d + 48
h = (33 * d + 48) / 73

Step 2: Substitute the expression for h into the second equation.
10 * d + 14 * ((33 * d + 48) / 73) = 91

Step 3: Simplify the equation and solve for d.
10 * d + (462 * d + 672) / 73 = 91
730 * d + 462 * d + 672 = 6643
1192 * d + 672 = 6643
1192 * d = 5971
d = 5971 / 1192
d = 5

Step 4: Substitute the value of d into the expression for h from Step 1.
h = (33 * 5 + 48) / 73
h = 213 / 73
h = 2.9178082191780823 (rounded to 16 decimal places)

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:

From equation 1, we can express q in terms of e:
43 * q - 44 * e = 29
43 * q = 29 + 44 * e
q = (29 + 44 * e) / 43

Now, substitute this expression for q into equation 2:
30 * ((29 + 44 * e) / 43) + 43 * e = 130

Simplify:
(870 + 1320 * e) / 43 + 43 * e = 130
870 / 43 + 1320 * e / 43 + 43 * e = 130
20.23 + 30.70 * e + 43 * e = 130
73.70 * e = 109.77
e = 109.77 / 73.70

From the second equation, let's solve for r in terms of a:
109 = 37a + 6r
6r = 109 - 37a
r = (109 - 37a) / 6
r = (109/6) - (37/6)a
r = 18.1666... - 6.1666...a

Now, substitute this expression for r into the first equation:
53 = 89r - 74a
53 = 89(18.1666... - 6.1666...a) - 74a
53 = 1616.8333... - 549.8333...a - 74a
53 = 1616.8333... - 623.8333...a
623.8333...a = 1616.8333... - 53
623.8333...a = 1563.8333...

        Given the following pair of equations where 'g' and 'q' represent the quantities of two different types of grains in a mix, solve for 'g' and 'q':

1. The sum of the weights of 42 units of 'g' and 12 units of 'q' equals 169 kg.
2. The weight of 12 units of 'q' minus the weight of 50 units of 'g' results in 19 kg.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step. We need to find the weight of one unit of 'g' and one unit of 'q'.

From equation 1:
42g + 12q = 169 ... (1)

From equation 2:
12q - 50g = 19 ... (2)

Step 1: Multiply equation (2) by -1 to eliminate the negative sign.
50g - 12q = -19 ... (3)

Step 2: Add equations (1) and (3) to eliminate 'q'.
42g + 12q = 169
50g - 12q = -19
_______________
92g = 150

Step 3: Solve for 'g'.
g = 150 ÷ 92
g = 1.63043478 ... (4)

Step 4: Substitute the value of 'g' in equation (1) to solve for 'q'.
42(1.63043478) + 12q = 169
68.47826076 + 12q = 169
12q = 169 - 68.47826076
12q = 100.5217392
q = 100.5217392 ÷ 12
q = 8.37681160 ... (5)

Therefore, the weight of one unit of grain 'g' is approximately 1.63 kg, and the weight of one unit of grain 'q' is approximately 8.38 kg.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for s in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation to solve for v.

1. Solve for s in the first equation:
   37 * s - 11 * v = 54
   37 * s = 54 + 11 * v
   s = (54 + 11 * v) / 37

2. Substitute the expression for s into the second equation:
   82 * s - 62 * v = 41
   82 * ((54 + 11 * v) / 37) - 62 * v = 41

3. Simplify the equation:
   (82 * (54 + 11 * v)) / 37 - 62 * v = 41
   (4428 + 902 * v) / 37 - 62 * v = 41

4. Multiply both sides by 37 to eliminate fractions:
   4428 + 902 * v - 2294 * v = 1517
   4428 - 1392 * v = 1517

5. Subtract 4428 from both sides:
   -1392 * v = -2911

6. Divide both sides by -1392 to solve for v:
   v = 2911 / 1392
   v ≈ 2.09

7. Substitute v ≈ 2.09 into the equation from step 1 to solve for s:
   s = (54 + 11 * 2.09) / 37
   s = (54 + 22.99) / 37
   s = 76.99 / 37
   s ≈ 2.08

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve for c and z, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for c in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation to solve for z.

From the first equation, 41 * c + 65 * z = 151, we can express c in terms of z:
41 * c = 151 - 65 * z
c = (151 - 65 * z) / 41

Now, let's substitute this expression for c into the second equation, 78 * z - 48 * c = 48:
78 * z - 48 * ((151 - 65 * z) / 41) = 48
78 * z - (48 * 151 - 48 * 65 * z) / 41 = 48
78 * z - (7248 - 3120 * z) / 41 = 48
3198 * z - 7248 / 41 + 3120 * z / 41 = 48
(3198 * 41 * z - 7248 + 3120 * z) / 41 = 48
(131118 * z - 7248 + 3120 * z) / 41 = 48
(134238 * z - 7248) / 41 = 48
134238 * z - 7248 = 1968

z = 9216 / 134238
z = &lt;&lt;9216/134238=0.0686275&gt;&gt;0.0686275

Now that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into the equation for c:

v = (37*e + 69) / 71

Now, substitute this expression for v into equation 2:
41*e + 76*v = 184
41*e + 76*((37*e + 69) / 71) = 184

Simplify the equation:
41*e + (76*37*e + 76*69) / 71 = 184

Step 1: Solve equation 1 for v in terms of d.
25v + 69d = 113
25v = 113 - 69d
v = (113 - 69d) / 25

Step 2: Substitute the expression for v into equation 2.
42((113 - 69d) / 25) + 26d = 85

Step 3: Simplify the equation and solve for d.
(4746 - 2898d) / 25 + 26d = 85
4746 - 2898d + 650d = 2125
4746 - 2248d = 2125
-2248d = -2621
d = -2621 / -2248
d = &lt;&lt;-2621/-2248=1.165925266903915&gt;&gt;1.165925266903915

Step 4: Substitute the value of d into the expression for v from step 1.
v = (113 - 69(1.165925266903915)) / 25
v = (113 - 80.44834334623217) / 25

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations for g and z, we can use the substitution method or the elimination method. Let's use the substitution method here.

From the first equation, we can express z in terms of g:
43 * z - 91 * g = 33
43 * z = 91 * g + 33
z = (91 * g + 33) / 43

Now, substitute this expression for z into the second equation:
72 * g - 3 * ((91 * g + 33) / 43) = 68

Simplify:
72 * g - (273 * g + 99) / 43 = 68
3096 * g - 273 * g - 99 = 2924
2823 * g - 99 = 2924
2823 * g = 3023
g = 3023 / 2823

Now that we have the value of g, we can substitute it back into the expression for z:
z = (91 * (3023 / 2823) + 33) / 43

Simplify:
z = (273993 / 2823 + 33) / 43
z = (273993 + 93159) / 121969
z = 367152 / 121969

Therefore, the solutions for g and z are:
g = 3023 / 2823
z = 367152 / 121969

        Alex's and Brad's baskets contained c cherries and f figs respectively. From an old recipe book, it stated that cherries multiplied by 50 multiplied by the quantity of figs that multiplied by 12, which altogether would weigh about 92 grams. Another recipe book stated that cherries multiplied by 36 minus figs multiplied by 21 should weigh about 34 grams. Can you find the quantity of cherries (c) and figs (f)? Use the following system of equations to solve:

50c + 12f = 92
36c - 21f = 34.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for c in the second equation and substitute it into the first equation to solve for f.

From the second equation:
36c - 21f = 34
36c = 34 + 21f
c = (34 + 21f) / 36
c = (17 + 21f) / 18 (simplifying the fraction)

Substituting this expression for c into the first equation:
50c + 12f = 92
50((17 + 21f) / 18) + 12f = 92
(850 + 1050f) / 18 + 12f = 92
850 + 1050f + 216f = 1656
1266f = 806
f = 806 / 1266
f = 62 / 79

Now that we have the value of f, we can substitute it back into the equation for c:
c = (17 + 21f) / 18
c = (17 + 21(62/79)) / 18
c = (1343 + 1302) / 1422
c = 2645 / 1422
c = 1 76/79

Therefore, the quantity of cherries (c) is 1 76/79, and the quantity of figs (f) is 62/79.

        Here are the equations you'll need to solve (remember, the goal is to find the values of u and d):

1) 87u - 75d = 7
2) 85d - 82u = 54

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this system of equations step by step to find the values of u and d.

Given equations:
1) 87u - 75d = 7
2) 85d - 82u = 54

Step 1: Multiply equation (1) by 82 and equation (2) by 87 to eliminate the variable u.
Equation (1): 82(87u - 75d = 7) → 7134u - 6150d = 574
Equation (2): 87(85d - 82u = 54) → 7395d - 7134u = 4698

Step 2: Add the resulting equations from step 1 to eliminate the variable u.
7134u - 6150d = 574
7395d - 7134u = 4698
1245d = 5272

Step 3: Solve for d by dividing both sides by 1245.
d = 5272 ÷ 1245
d = 4.23

Step 4: Substitute the value of d into equation (1) to solve for u.
87u - 75(4.23) = 7
87u - 317.25 = 7
87u = 324.25
u = 324.25 ÷ 87
u = 3.73

Therefore, the values of u and d are:
u = 3.73
d = 4.23

        Bill is trying to decipher a secret code. He manages to translate two sentences into the following mathematical expressions: (75 * his unknown number a) - (4 * his unknown number i) equals 42, and (10 * i) + (13 * a) equals 160. Using these equations, can you figure out the values of i and a for him?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step using a system of equations. We have two equations with two unknown variables, a and i.

Equation 1: (75 * a) - (4 * i) = 42
Equation 2: (10 * i) + (13 * a) = 160

Step 1: Simplify Equation 1 by dividing both sides by 3.
(25 * a) - (4/3 * i) = 14

Step 2: Substitute the value of a from Equation 2 into the simplified Equation 1.
(25 * ((160 - 10 * i) / 13)) - (4/3 * i) = 14

Step 3: Solve for i.
(25 * (160 - 10 * i)) / 13 - (4/3 * i) = 14
(4000 - 250 * i) / 13 - (4/3 * i) = 14
(4000 - 250 * i) / 13 - (52/3 * i) = 14
(12000 - 750 * i) / 39 - (52/3 * i) = 14
(12000 - 750 * i) / 39 - (156/9 * i) = 14
(108000 - 6750 * i) / 351 - (156/9 * i) = 14
(108000 - 6750 * i) / 351 - (6084/351 * i) = 14
(108000 - 6750 * i - 6084 * i) / 351 = 14
(108000 - 12834 * i) / 351 = 14
108000 - 12834 * i = 4914
-12834 * i = -103086
i = 8

Step 4: Substitute the value of i into Equation 2 to solve for a.
(10 * 8) + (13 * a) = 160
80 + 13 * a = 160
13 * a = 80
a = 80 / 13

Therefore, the values are:
i = 8
a = 80 / 13

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other using the first equation, then substitute it into the second equation to solve for the remaining variable.

Given equations:
37 * p + 74 * c = 183 ... (1)
27 * c - 18 * p = 13 ... (2)

Step 1: Solve equation (1) for p in terms of c.
37 * p + 74 * c = 183
37 * p = 183 - 74 * c
p = (183 - 74 * c) / 37

Step 2: Substitute the expression for p into equation (2).
27 * c - 18 * ((183 - 74 * c) / 37) = 13

Step 3: Solve the equation for c.
27 * c - (3294 - 1332 * c) / 37 = 13
999 * c - (3294 - 1332 * c) / 37 = 481
36963 * c - 3294 + 1332 * c = 17797
38295 * c = 21091
c = 21091 / 38295
c = 0.5508 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Step 4: Substitute the value of c into the expression for p from Step 1.
p = (183 - 74 * 0.5508) / 37
p = (183 - 40.7592) / 37

48k = 37 + 30p
k = (37 + 30p) / 48

Now, substitute the expression for k into the second equation:
(16 * p) + (33 * k) = 105
16p + 33 * ((37 + 30p) / 48) = 105
16p + (1221 + 990p) / 48 = 105
16p + 1221/48 + 990p/48 = 105
16p + 25.4375 + 20.625p = 105
36.625p + 25.4375 = 105
36.625p = 79.5625
p = 79.5625 / 36.625

Step 1: Solve equation 2 for f in terms of v.
46f + 53v = 110
46f = 110 - 53v
f = (110 - 53v) ÷ 46
f = 110/46 - 53v/46

f = 2.391304348 - 1.152173913v

Step 2: Substitute the expression for f into equation 1.
75v - 69f = 14
75v - 69(2.391304348 - 1.152173913v) = 14
75v - 165 + 79.5v = 14

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for z in terms of y using the second equation and then substitute it into the first equation to solve for y.

Given equations:
1. 24 * z + 72 * y = 139
2. 2 * z + 82 * y = 96

Step 1: Solve for z in terms of y using the second equation.
2 * z + 82 * y = 96
2 * z = 96 - 82 * y
z = (96 - 82 * y) / 2
z = 48 - 41 * y

Step 2: Substitute the expression for z into the first equation and solve for y.
24 * z + 72 * y = 139
24 * (48 - 41 * y) + 72 * y = 139
1152 - 984 * y + 72 * y = 139
1152 - 912 * y = 139
-912 * y = -1013
y = -1013 / -912
y = &lt;&lt;-1013/-912=1.11&gt;&gt;1.11 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 3: Substitute the value of y into the expression for z from Step 1.
z = 48 - 41 * y
z = 48 - 41 * 1.11
z = 48 - 45.51
z = &lt;&lt;48-45.51=2.49&gt;&gt;2.49 (rounded to two decimal places)

Given equations:
1. (87 * o) - (29 * v) = 1
2. (8 * v) + (30 * o) = 91

Step 1: Solve for v in terms of o using equation 1.
(87 * o) - (29 * v) = 1
-29 * v = 1 - (87 * o)
v = (1 - (87 * o)) / (-29)
v = (87 * o - 1) / 29

Step 2: Substitute the expression for v into equation 2.
(8 * ((87 * o - 1) / 29)) + (30 * o) = 91

Step 3: Solve for o.
(8 * (87 * o - 1) / 29) + (30 * o) = 91
(696 * o - 8) / 29 + (30 * o) = 91
(696 * o - 8 + 870 * o) / 29 = 91
(1566 * o - 8) / 29 = 91
1566 * o - 8 = 91 * 29
1566 * o - 8 = 2639
1566 * o = 2647
o = 2647 / 1566
o = 1.69 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 4: Substitute the value of o into the expression for v from step 1.
v = (87 * 1.69 - 1) / 29
v = (147.03 - 1) / 29
v = 146.03 / 29
v = 5.04 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:

First equation: (23 * h) - (46 * p) = 58
23h - 46p = 58
23h = 58 + 46p
h = (58 + 46p) / 23
h = 58/23 + 2p

Now, substitute the expression for h into the second equation:
Second equation: (11 * p) + (23 * h) = 124
11p + 23(58/23 + 2p) = 124
11p + 58 + 46p = 124
57p + 58 = 124
57p = 66
p = 66/57

Now that we have the value of p, we can substitute it back into the expression for h:
h = 58/23 + 2p
h = 58/23 + 2(66/57)
h = 58/23 + 132/57

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve equation 1) for d in terms of f, then substitute the expression for d into equation 2) to solve for f. Finally, we'll substitute the value of f back into equation 1) to find the value of d.

Step 1: Solve equation 1) for d in terms of f.
19d + 6f = 120
19d = 120 - 6f
d = (120 - 6f) ÷ 19
d = (120 - 6f)/19

Step 2: Substitute the expression for d into equation 2) and solve for f.
90d - 42f = 69
90((120 - 6f)/19) - 42f = 69
(10800 - 540f)/19 - 42f = 69
10800/19 - 540f/19 - 42f = 69
(10800 - 540f - 798f)/19 = 69
(10800 - 1338f)/19 = 69
10800 - 1338f = 1311
-1338f = -9489
f = -9489/-1338
f = &lt;&lt;-9489/-1338=7.1&gt;&gt;7

Step 3: Substitute the value of f into equation 1) to find the value of d.
19d + 6f = 120

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Sure, I can solve this system of linear equations using the substitution method. Let's solve for one of the variables in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.

Given equations:
1) 42 * m + 55 * r = 127
2) 66 * m - 52 * r = 44

Step 1: Solve equation 1 for m in terms of r.
42 * m + 55 * r = 127
42 * m = 127 - 55 * r
m = (127 - 55 * r) / 42

Step 2: Substitute the expression for m into equation 2.
66 * ((127 - 55 * r) / 42) - 52 * r = 44
(66 * (127 - 55 * r)) / 42 - 52 * r = 44
(8382 - 3630 * r) / 42 - 52 * r = 44
199.5714 - 86.4286 * r - 52 * r = 44
199.5714 - 138.4286 * r = 44
-138.4286 * r = -155.5714
r = 1.1238

Step 3: Substitute the value of r into the expression for m.
m = (127 - 55 * 1.1238) / 42
m = (127 - 61.8095) / 42
m = 65.1905 / 42
m = 1.5522

From the first equation, let's solve for n:
31n + 64w = 120
31n = 120 - 64w
n = (120 - 64w) / 31

Now, substitute this expression for n into the second equation:
57w + 71n = 173
57w + 71((120 - 64w) / 31) = 173

Simplify:
57w + (8520 - 4544w) / 31 = 173
1767w + 8520 - 4544w = 5363
1767w - 4544w = 5363 - 8520
-2777w = -3157
w = 3157 / 2777
w = &lt;&lt;3157/2777=1.136693554&gt;&gt;1.136693554...

Now that we have the value of w, we can substitute it back into the expression for n:

From equation (1), we have:
72 * a + 26 * u = 112
26 * u = 112 - 72 * a
u = (112 - 72 * a) / 26
u = 56/13 - 36/13 * a

Now, substitute this expression for u into equation (2):
76 * (56/13 - 36/13 * a) - 77 * a = 31
4256/13 - 2736/13 * a - 77 * a = 31

Now that we have the value of a, let's substitute it back into the equation for u:

Given equations:
1. 54n + 18b = 143
2. 87n - 93b = 48

Step 1: Solve equation 1 for n in terms of b.
54n + 18b = 143
54n = 143 - 18b
n = (143 - 18b) / 54
n = (143/54) - (1/3)b

Step 2: Substitute the expression for n into equation 2.
87n - 93b = 48
87((143/54) - (1/3)b) - 93b = 48
(87 × 143/54) - (87/3)b - 93b = 48
(87 × 143/54) - (87/3 + 93)b = 48
(87 × 143/54) - (29 + 93)b = 48
(87 × 143/54) - 122b = 48

Step 3: Solve the equation for b.
(87 × 143/54) - 122b = 48
-122b = 48 - (87 × 143/54)
-122b = 48 - 231
-122b = -183
b = -183 / -122
b = 3/2 or 1.5

Step 4: Substitute the value of b into the expression for n from step 1.
n = (143/54) - (1/3)b
n = (143/54) - (1/3) × (3/2)
n = (143/54) - (1/2)

69 * e - 88 * ((103 - 53 * e) / 7) = 6
69 * e - 88 * (103 / 7) + 88 * (53 * e / 7) = 6
69 * e - 1298 / 7 + 4664 * e / 7 = 6

51s - (168s/18 + 504/18) = 14
51s - (28s/3 + 84/3) = 14
153s/3 - 28s/3 - 84/3 = 14
(153s - 28s - 84) / 3 = 14
(125s - 84) / 3 = 14
125s - 84 = 42
125s = 126
s = 126 / 125

Now that we have the value of s, we can substitute it back into the equation for p:

p = (7s + 21) / 18
p = (7 * (126/125) + 21) / 18
p = (882/125 + 21) / 18
p = (882/125 + 2625/125) / 18
p = 3507 / (125 * 18)
p = 3507 / 2250

Therefore, the values of p and s that satisfy both equations are:
s = 126 / 125 = 1.008
p = 3507 / 2250 ≈ 1.558

The first equation is 59 times c minus 34 times w is equal to 84.
The second equation is 11 times c plus 42 times w is equal to 98.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step using the substitution method.

Given equations:
1. 59c - 34w = 84
2. 11c + 42w = 98

Step 1: Solve equation 1 for c in terms of w.
59c - 34w = 84
59c = 84 + 34w
c = (84 + 34w) / 59
c = 84/59 + (34/59)w

Step 2: Substitute the expression for c into equation 2.
11c + 42w = 98
11(84/59 + (34/59)w) + 42w = 98
(924/59 + (374/59)w) + 42w = 98
924/59 + (374/59)w + 42w = 98
924/59 + (374/59 + 42)w = 98
924/59 + (2478/59 + 42)w = 98
924/59 + (2520/59)w = 98

Step 3: Solve the equation for w.
924/59 + (2520/59)w = 98
(2520/59)w = 98 - 924/59
w = (98 - 924/59) / (2520/59)
w = (5782 - 924) / 2520
w = 4858 / 2520
w = 1.927

Step 4: Substitute the value of w into the expression for c.
c = 84/59 + (34/59)w
c = 84/59 + (34/59)(1.927)
c = 1.424 + 1.111
c = 2.535

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:
c ≈ 2.535

2. 60z - 42f = 13

Step 1: Solve for f in terms of z using the first equation.
45f + 42z = 101
45f = 101 - 42z
f = (101 - 42z) ÷ 45
f = (101 - 42z) / 45

Step 2: Substitute the expression for f into the second equation.
60z - 42((101 - 42z) / 45) = 13

Step 3: Solve for z.
60z - 42(101 - 42z) / 45 = 13
60z - (42 × 101 - 42 × 42z) / 45 = 13

Step 1: Solve the first equation for p in terms of u.
26 * p - 21 * u = 6
26 * p = 6 + 21 * u
p = (6 + 21 * u) / 26
p = (3 + 21 * u) / 13

Step 2: Substitute the expression for p into the second equation.
15 * p + 58 * u = 83
15 * ((3 + 21 * u) / 13) + 58 * u = 83
(45 + 315 * u) / 13 + 58 * u = 83

Step 3: Solve the equation for u.
(45 + 315 * u) / 13 + 58 * u = 83
45 / 13 + 315 * u / 13 + 58 * u = 83
45 / 13 + (315 / 13 + 58) * u = 83

Given equations:

2) 59 * n + 8 * s = 75

Step 1: Solve equation (2) for n in terms of s.
59 * n + 8 * s = 75
59 * n = 75 - 8 * s
n = (75 - 8 * s) / 59

Step 2: Substitute the expression for n from step 1 into equation (1).
92 * ((75 - 8 * s) / 59) - 38 * s = 62
(92 * (75 - 8 * s)) / 59 - 38 * s = 62
(6900 - 736 * s) / 59 - 38 * s = 62
6900 / 59 - (736 * s) / 59 - 38 * s = 62
6900 / 59 - (736 * s + 2242 * s) / 59 = 62
6900 / 59 - (2978 * s) / 59 = 62
6900 - 2978 * s = 3658
3922 = 2978 * s
s = 3922 / 2978

87 * z = 63 + 35 * e
z = (63 + 35 * e) / 87 ... (3)

Step 2: Substitute the expression for z from equation (3) into equation (2).
81 * ((63 + 35 * e) / 87) + 58 * e = 154
(81 * (63 + 35 * e)) / 87 + 58 * e = 154
(5103 + 2835 * e) / 87 + 58 * e = 154

Given equations:

Step 1: Solve equation (1) for t in terms of h.
(11 * t) + (44 * h) = 110
11 * t = 110 - 44 * h
t = (110 - 44 * h) / 11
t = 10 - 4 * h ... (3)

Step 2: Substitute the expression for t from equation (3) into equation (2).
(98 * t) - (36 * h) = 18
98 * (10 - 4 * h) - 36 * h = 18
980 - 392 * h - 36 * h = 18
980 - 428 * h = 18

From the first equation: ((69 * b) - (50 * o)) = 55
69b - 50o = 55
69b = 55 + 50o
b = (55 + 50o) / 69

Now, substitute the expression for b into the second equation:

2769o + 990 = 5865
2769o = 4875
o = 4875 / 2769

Now that we have the value of o, we can substitute it back into the expression for b:

Now, substitute the expression for p into the first equation:

Substitute this value of k into the first equation:

33 * k - 41 * f = 31
33 * k - 41 * 2.51 = 31
33 * k - 102.91 = 31
33 * k = 31 + 102.91
33 * k = 133.91
k = 133.91 / 33
k = &lt;&lt;133.91/33=4.06&gt;&gt;4.06

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for n in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation to solve for l.

1. Solve the first equation for n:
   31 = 58 * l - n
   31 - 58 * l = -n
   n = 58 * l - 31

2. Substitute the expression for n into the second equation:
   103 = (58 * l - 31) + 73 * l
   103 = 58 * l - 31 + 73 * l
   103 = 131 * l - 31

3. Solve the equation for l:
   103 + 31 = 131 * l
   134 = 131 * l
   l = 134 / 131
   &lt;&lt;134/131=1.022900763358779&gt;&gt;l ≈ 1.023

4. Substitute the value of l into the expression for n:

   n = 58 * 1.023 - 31
   &lt;&lt;58*1.023-31=28.334&gt;&gt;n ≈ 28.334

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method.

Step 1: Solve the first equation for y in terms of j.
29y - 28j = 39
29y = 39 + 28j
y = (39 + 28j) / 29

Step 2: Substitute the expression for y into the second equation.

25((39 + 28j) / 29) + 37j = 116

Step 3: Simplify the equation and solve for j.
25(39 + 28j) + 1073j = 3364
975 + 700j + 1073j = 3364
1773j = 2389
j = 2389 / 1773
j = 1.347 (rounded to three decimal places)

Step 4: Substitute the value of j into the expression for y from Step 1.
y = (39 + 28j) / 29
y = (39 + 28(1.347)) / 29
y = 76.716 / 29

From the first equation, we have:

97 * u = 61 * g + 15
u = (61 * g + 15) / 97

Now, let's substitute this expression for u into the second equation:

From equation 1, solve for n in terms of t:
(85 * n) - (54 * t) = 41
(85 * n) = (54 * t) + 41
n = ((54 * t) + 41) / 85

Now, substitute the expression for n into equation 2:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this system of equations step by step:

1) 75u - 69q = 5
2) 48u + 25q = 140

Step 1: Multiply equation (1) by 48 and equation (2) by 75.
48(75u - 69q = 5) → 3600u - 3312q = 240
75(48u + 25q = 140) → 3600u + 1875q = 10500

Step 2: Subtract the new equation (1) from the new equation (2) to eliminate the variable u.
(3600u + 1875q = 10500) - (3600u - 3312q = 240)
1875q + 3312q = 10500 - 240
5187q = 10260

Step 3: Solve for q by dividing both sides by 5187.
q = 10260 ÷ 5187
q = 1.9779... ≈ 1.98

Step 4: Substitute the value of q into equation (1) to solve for u.
75u - 69(1.98) = 5
75u - 136.62 = 5
75u = 141.62

   ((24 * x) - (49 * (149 - (17 * x)) / 20)) = 22
   ((24 * x) - ((7301 - (833 * x)) / 20)) = 22
   (480 * x) - (7301 - (833 * x)) = 440

   6c + 55o = 112
   6c = 112 - 55o
   c = (112 - 55o) / 6
   c = 56/3 - 55o/6

2. Substitute the expression for c into the second equation:
   55c - 48o = 36
   55(56/3 - 55o/6) - 48o = 36
   (55 × 56/3) - (55 × 55o/6) - 48o = 36
   1026.67 - 504.17o - 48o = 36
   1026.67 - 552.17o = 36
   -552.17o = -990.67
   o = 990.67/552.17
   o = 1.79 (rounded to two decimal places)

3. Substitute o = 1.79 into the expression for c:
   c = 56/3 - 55o/6
   c = 56/3 - 55 × 1.79/6
   c = 18.67 - 16.41
   c = 2.26 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the values that satisfy the system of equations are approximately:
c = 2.26
o = 1.79

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other using the first equation, then substitute it into the second equation to solve for the remaining variable.

Given equations:
8w + 68u = 170 ... (1)
71w - 94u = 8 ... (2)

Step 1: Solve for w in equation (1):
8w + 68u = 170
8w = 170 - 68u
w = (170 - 68u) ÷ 8
w = 21.25 - 8.5u ... (3)

Step 2: Substitute w from equation (3) into equation (2):
71(21.25 - 8.5u) - 94u = 8
1508.75 - 603.5u - 94u = 8
1508.75 - 697.5u = 8
-697.5u = 8 - 1508.75
-697.5u = -1500.75
u = -1500.75 ÷ -697.5
u = 2.15

Step 3: Substitute u = 2.15 into equation (3) to find w:
w = 21.25 - 8.5(2.15)
w = 21.25 - 18.275
w = 2.975

Therefore, the values that satisfy the system of equations are:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.

From the first equation, solve for f:
68*r + 8*f = 92
8*f = 92 - 68*r
f = (92 - 68*r) / 8
f = (92/8) - (68/8)*r
f = 11.5 - 8.5*r

Now, substitute the expression for f into the second equation:
97*f + 38*r = 182
97*(11.5 - 8.5*r) + 38*r = 182
1115.5 - 824.5*r + 38*r = 182
1115.5 - 786.5*r = 182
-786.5*r = -933.5
r = 933.5 / 786.5
r = 1.1869436201780415 ≈ 1.19

Now that we have the value of r, we can substitute it back into the expression for f:
f = 11.5 - 8.5*r
f = 11.5 - 8.5*1.1869436201780415
f = 11.5 - 10.089020771513353
f = 1.4109792284866471 ≈ 1.41

        Given the equations below, find the values of r and d:

For the first equation, consider 67 apples, each worth d dollars, and 37 ragdolls, each worth r dollars. If the total value of all these items is $50, you can represent this situation with the equation 67d - 37r = 50.

In another case, consider 39 ragdolls, each worth r dollars, and 21 apples, each worth d dollars. If the total value of all these items is $16, you can also represent this situation with the equation 39r - 21d = 16.

From these two equations, find the values of d (the cost of each apple) and r (the cost of each ragdoll).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step using the given equations:

Equation 1: 67d - 37r = 50
Equation 2: 39r - 21d = 16

Step 1: Multiply equation 2 by 2 to eliminate the decimal fraction when adding the equations later.
2 × (39r - 21d = 16)
78r - 42d = 32

Step 2: Add equation 1 and the modified equation 2 to eliminate the variable d.
(67d - 37r = 50) + (78r - 42d = 32)
25d + 41r = 82

Step 3: Substitute the value of 25d from equation 1 into the equation from step 2.
Equation 1: 67d - 37r = 50
25d = 50 + 37r
Substituting in the equation from step 2:
(50 + 37r) + 41r = 82
50 + 78r = 82

Step 4: Solve for r.
78r = 82 - 50
78r = 32
r = 32 ÷ 78
r = 0.4102564...
Rounded to the nearest cent, r ≈ $0.41

Step 5: Substitute the value of r in equation 1 to solve for d.
67d - 37 × 0.41 = 50
67d - 15.17 = 50
67d = 65.17
d = 65.17 ÷ 67
d = 0.9726865...
Rounded to the nearest cent, d ≈ $0.97

Therefore, the cost of each ragdoll (r) is approximately $0.41, and the cost of each apple (d) is approximately $0.97.

1. Solve the second equation for x:
   24 = 98x - 84a
   24 + 84a = 98x
   (24 + 84a) / 98 = x
   x = (24 + 84a) / 98

2. Substitute the expression for x into the first equation:
   163 = 50x + a
   163 = 50((24 + 84a) / 98) + a
   163 = (1200 + 4200a) / 98 + a
   163 = (1200 / 98) + (4200a / 98) + a
   163 = 12.24 + 42.86a + a
   163 = 12.24 + 43.86a
   163 - 12.24 = 43.86a

b = (110 - 67 * p) / 18 ... (3)

Step 2: Substitute the expression for b from equation (3) into equation (2).
82 * ((110 - 67 * p) / 18) - 44 * p = 58
(9020 - 5494 * p) / 18 - 44 * p = 58

From the first equation, let's solve for l:
((29 * l) + (17 * g)) = 68
29l + 17g = 68
29l = 68 - 17g
l = (68 - 17g) / 29

Now, substitute the expression for l into the second equation:
((31 * g) - (10 * ((68 - 17g) / 29))) = 17

Simplify:
31g - (10 * (68 - 17g) / 29) = 17
31g - ((680 - 170g) / 29) = 17
31g - (680/29 - 170g/29) = 17
31g - 680/29 + 170g/29 = 17
(31g + 170g/29) - 680/29 = 17
(899g/29) - 680/29 = 17
899g/29 = 17 + 680/29
899g/29 = 697/29
899g = 697
g = 697/899
g = &lt;&lt;697/899=0.7753059&gt;&gt;0.7753059

Now, substitute the value of g back into the equation for l:

1. Solve for 'a' in the first equation:
   33*a - 54*c = 20
   33*a = 54*c + 20
   a = (54*c + 20) / 33

2. Substitute 'a' into the second equation:
   24*a - 26*c = 29
   24*((54*c + 20) / 33) - 26*c = 29

3. Simplify the equation:
   24*(54*c + 20) / 33 - 26*c = 29
   (24*54*c + 24*20) / 33 - 26*c = 29
   (1296*c + 480) / 33 - 26*c = 29

4. Multiply both sides by 33 to eliminate fractions:
   1296*c + 480 - 33*26*c = 29*33
   1296*c + 480 - 858*c = 957
   438*c + 480 = 957

5. Subtract 480 from both sides:

7. Substitute 'c' into the first equation to solve for 'a':

        Kat found herself stuck solving the following system of equations with two variables, d and j. Can you help her resolve it?

71d + 9j = 132
43j - 84d = 91.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Sure, I can help Kat solve this system of equations using the substitution method. Let's solve for one of the variables in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.

Given equations:
71d + 9j = 132 ... (1)
43j - 84d = 91 ... (2)

Step 1: Solve equation (1) for j in terms of d.
71d + 9j = 132
9j = 132 - 71d
j = (132 - 71d) ÷ 9
j = (132 ÷ 9) - (71 ÷ 9)d
j = 14 - (71 ÷ 9)d ... (3)

Step 2: Substitute the expression for j from equation (3) into equation (2).
43(14 - (71 ÷ 9)d) - 84d = 91
602 - (1591 ÷ 3)d - 84d = 91
602 - 530.33d - 84d = 91
602 - 614.33d = 91

Step 3: Solve the resulting equation for d.
602 - 614.33d = 91
-614.33d = 91 - 602
-614.33d = -511
d = -511 ÷ -614.33
d ≈ 0.832

Step 4: Substitute the value of d into equation (3) to find j.
j = 14 - (71 ÷ 9)(0.832)
j = 14 - 6.554
j ≈ 7.446

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:
d ≈ 0.832 and j ≈ 7.446

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method.

Given equations:
(81 * o) + (26 * n) = 163 ... (1)
(87 * n) + (23 * o) = 143 ... (2)

Step 1: Solve equation (1) for o in terms of n.
(81 * o) + (26 * n) = 163
81 * o = 163 - 26 * n
o = (163 - 26 * n) / 81 ... (3)

Step 2: Substitute the expression for o from equation (3) into equation (2).
(87 * n) + (23 * ((163 - 26 * n) / 81)) = 143

Step 3: Simplify the equation and solve for n.
(87 * n) + ((3749 - 598 * n) / 81) = 143
7047 * n + 3749 - 598 * n = 11583
6449 * n = 7834
n = 7834 / 6449
n ≈ 1.215 ... (4)

Step 4: Substitute the value of n from equation (4) into equation (3) to find o.
o = (163 - 26 * 1.215) / 81
o = (163 - 31.59) / 81
o = 131.41 / 81
o ≈ 1.622

        Solve the following system of equations for w and s:

46 * s - 61 * w = 2 
61 * s + 67 * w = 178.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.

From the first equation, let's solve for s:
46 * s - 61 * w = 2
46 * s = 61 * w + 2
s = (61 * w + 2) / 46

Now, substitute the expression for s into the second equation:
61 * s + 67 * w = 178
61 * ((61 * w + 2) / 46) + 67 * w = 178

Simplify:
(61 * (61 * w + 2)) / 46 + 67 * w = 178
(3721 * w + 122) / 46 + 67 * w = 178

Multiply both sides by 46:
3721 * w + 122 + 3082 * w = 8188
6803 * w + 122 = 8188

Subtract 122 from both sides:
6803 * w = 8066

Divide both sides by 6803:
w = 8066 / 6803
w ≈ 1.1857

Now that we have the value of w, we can substitute it back into the expression for s:
s = (61 * w + 2) / 46
s = (61 * 1.1857 + 2) / 46
s ≈ 1.5857

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.

From the first equation, we can solve for k:
51*k - 8*i = 86
51*k = 86 + 8*i
k = (86 + 8*i) / 51
k = (86/51) + (8/51)*i
k = (86 + 8*i) / 51

Now, substitute the expression for k into the second equation:
39*i + 8*k = 193
39*i + 8*((86 + 8*i) / 51) = 193
39*i + (688 + 64*i) / 51 = 193
39*i + (688/51) + (64/51)*i = 193
39*i + (64/51)*i = 193 - (688/51)
(1989/51)*i = 9073/51
i = 9073/1989
i = 91/21

Now that we have the value of i, we can substitute it back into the expression for k:
k = (86 + 8*i) / 51
k = (86 + 8*(91/21)) / 51
k = (86 + 364/21) / 51
k = (1806 + 364) / (21*51)
k = 2170 / 1071

1. Solve the second equation for l:
   93m + l = 126
   l = 126 - 93m

2. Substitute the expression for l into the first equation:
   26m + 17l = 146
   26m + 17(126 - 93m) = 146
   26m + 2142 - 1581m = 146

Step 1: Solve equation (1) for f in terms of h.
(8 * f) + (39 * h) = 66
8f = 66 - 39h
f = (66 - 39h) / 8

Step 2: Substitute the expression for f into equation (2) and solve for h.
(29 * f) + (46 * h) = 119
29 * ((66 - 39h) / 8) + 46h = 119
(29 * (66 - 39h)) / 8 + 46h = 119
(1914 - 1131h) / 8 + 46h = 119
1914 - 1131h + 368h = 952
1914 - 763h = 952

Step 1: Solve equation 1 for b in terms of k.
22 * b + 23 * k = 109
22 * b = 109 - 23 * k
b = (109 - 23 * k) / 22

Step 2: Substitute the expression for b into equation 2.

s = (63m - 98) / 2

Step 2: Substitute the expression for s into equation 1.

From equation 1, let's solve for b:

6b = 105 - 5k
b = (105 - 5k) / 6
b = 17.5 - (5/6)k

Now, substitute this expression for b into equation 2:
(95 * k) - (51 * (17.5 - (5/6)k)) = 67
95k - 892.5 + (255/6)k = 67
95k + (255/6)k - 892.5 = 67

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve for d and u, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for u in the second equation and substitute it into the first equation to solve for d.

From the second equation, 32u + 40d = 83, we get:
32u = 83 - 40d
u = (83 - 40d) / 32
u = (83/32) - (40/32)d
u = 2.59375 - 1.25d

Substituting this expression for u into the first equation:
33d + 62(2.59375 - 1.25d) = 114
33d + 160.8125 - 77.5d = 114
-44.5d + 160.8125 = 114
-44.5d = -46.8125
d = (-46.8125) / (-44.5)
d = 1.052

Now that we have the value of d, we can substitute it back into the expression for u:
u = 2.59375 - 1.25d
u = 2.59375 - 1.25(1.052)
u = 2.59375 - 1.315

        There are two equations below that contain the variables c and p. Can you solve this system of equations to find the values of c and p?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.

From the first equation, let's solve for c:
5c + 28p = 102
5c = 102 - 28p
c = (102 - 28p) / 5

Now, substitute this expression for c into the second equation:
20 * ((102 - 28p) / 5) - 67p = 13

Simplify:
(2040 - 560p) / 5 - 67p = 13
2040/5 - 560p/5 - 67p = 13
408 - 112p - 67p = 13
408 - 179p = 13

Solve for p:
-179p = 13 - 408
-179p = -395
p = -395 / -179
p = 395/179

Now that we have the value of p, we can substitute it back into the equation for c:
c = (102 - 28p) / 5
c = (102 - 28 * (395/179)) / 5
c = (102 - 61.8435754) / 5
c = 40.1564246 / 5
c = 8.0312849

Therefore, the solutions are:
p = 395/179 ≈ 2.2067039
c = 40.1564246 / 5 ≈ 8.0312849

        Given the following system of linear equations, determine the value of r and q. The system of equations is:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.

From the first equation, let's solve for r:
58 * r + 12 * q = 147
58 * r = 147 - 12 * q
r = (147 - 12 * q) / 58

Now, substitute the expression for r into the second equation:
97 * q - 76 * r = 76
97 * q - 76 * ((147 - 12 * q) / 58) = 76

Simplify the equation:
97 * q - 76 * (147 - 12 * q) / 58 = 76
97 * q - (76 * 147 - 76 * 12 * q) / 58 = 76
97 * q - (11172 - 912 * q) / 58 = 76

Multiply both sides by 58:
97 * 58 * q - 11172 + 912 * q = 76 * 58
5626 * q - 11172 + 912 * q = 4408
6538 * q - 11172 = 4408
6538 * q = 15580
q = 15580 / 6538
q = 2.38

Now that we have the value of q, we can substitute it back into the expression for r:
r = (147 - 12 * q) / 58
r = (147 - 12 * 2.38) / 58
r = (147 - 28.56) / 58
r = 118.44 / 58
r = 2.04

Therefore, the values of r and q are:
r = 2.04
q = 2.38

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the given system of simultaneous linear equations, we can use the substitution method or the elimination method. Let's use the substitution method here.

Given equations:
47 * v - 3 * k = 10 ... (1)
73 * v + 2 * k = 128 ... (2)

Step 1: Solve equation (1) for k in terms of v.
47 * v - 3 * k = 10
-3 * k = -47 * v + 10
k = (47 * v - 10) / 3 ... (3)

Step 2: Substitute the expression for k from equation (3) into equation (2).
73 * v + 2 * ((47 * v - 10) / 3) = 128
73 * v + (94 * v - 20) / 3 = 128
219 * v + 94 * v - 20 = 384
313 * v - 20 = 384
313 * v = 404
v = 404 / 313 ... (4)

Step 3: Substitute the value of v from equation (4) into equation (3) to find k.
k = (47 * (404 / 313) - 10) / 3
k = (18988 / 313 - 10) / 3
k = (18978 / 313) / 3
k = 6058 / 313

Step 4: Simplify the values of v and k.
v = 404 / 313 ≈ 1.29 ... (5)

Given equations:
1. 89p - 41q = 60
2. 27p + 91q = 124

Step 1: Solve equation 1 for p in terms of q.
89p - 41q = 60
89p = 60 + 41q
p = (60 + 41q) / 89

Step 2: Substitute the expression for p into equation 2.
27p + 91q = 124
27((60 + 41q) / 89) + 91q = 124

Step 3: Simplify the equation and solve for q.
(1620 + 1107q) / 89 + 91q = 124
1620 + 1107q + 8099q = 11036
9206q = 9416
q = 9416 / 9206
q = &lt;&lt;9416/9206=1.0228&gt;&gt;1.0228

Step 4: Substitute the value of q into the expression for p from step 1.
p = (60 + 41q) / 89
p = (60 + 41 × 1.0228) / 89
p = 101.9348 / 89

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve for u and d, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for u in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation to solve for d.

First equation: (88 * u) - (96 * d) = 12
88u - 96d = 12
88u = 96d + 12
u = (96d + 12) / 88
u = (12d + 1.5)

Now, substitute the expression for u into the second equation:
Second equation: (27 * u) + (36 * d) = 71
27 * (12d + 1.5) + 36d = 71
324d + 40.5 + 36d = 71
360d + 40.5 = 71
360d = 30.5
d = 30.5 / 360
d = 0.0847222...

Now that we have the value of d, we can substitute it back into the expression for u:
u = (12d + 1.5)
u = (12 * 0.0847222... + 1.5)
u = 2.5166666...

n = (70 + 2 * f) / 3

Step 2: Substitute the expression for n into equation 1.
20 * ((70 + 2 * f) / 3) - 18 * f = 9
(1400 + 40 * f) / 3 - 18 * f = 9
1400 / 3 + 40 * f / 3 - 18 * f = 9

1400 / 3 - 14 * f = 9

7 * l = 133 - 97 * j

   21d = 53 + 46f

From the first equation, 74u + 11w = 116, let's solve for u:
74u = 116 - 11w
u = (116 - 11w) / 74

Now, substitute this expression for u into the second equation, 66u - 68w = 21:
66 * ((116 - 11w) / 74) - 68w = 21

Simplify:
(66 * (116 - 11w)) / 74 - 68w = 21

103.4594594594595 - 9.810810810810813w - 68w = 21
103.4594594594595 - 77.81081081081081w = 21

Subtract 103.4594594594595 from both sides:
-77.81081081081081w = -82.4594594594595

Divide both sides by -77.81081081081081:

u = 104.34 / 74
u = 1.41

Step 4: Substitute the value of j into equation (3) to find f.
f = (4 + 21 * 2.0128) / 38
f = 46.2688 / 38
f = &lt;&lt;46.2688/38=1.2176&gt;&gt;1.2176

Therefore, the values of f and j that satisfy the given system of equations are:

        Consider the following system of equations. Find the values of u and e:
68u + 32e = 174
63e - 69u = 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method or the elimination method. Let's use the substitution method here.

From the first equation, we can express u in terms of e:
68u + 32e = 174
68u = 174 - 32e
u = (174 - 32e) / 68

Now, substitute this expression for u into the second equation:
63e - 69u = 1
63e - 69((174 - 32e) / 68) = 1

Simplify the equation:
63e - (69 × 174 - 69 × 32e) / 68 = 1
63e - (12006 - 2208e) / 68 = 1
4284e - 12006 + 2208e = 68
6492e - 12006 = 68
6492e = 12074
e = 12074 / 6492

Simplify the fraction:
e = &lt;&lt;12074/6492=1.86&gt;&gt;1.86

Now that we have the value of e, we can substitute it back into the expression for u:
u = (174 - 32e) / 68
u = (174 - 32 × 1.86) / 68
u = (174 - 59.52) / 68
u = 114.48 / 68

Simplify the fraction:
u = &lt;&lt;114.48/68=1.68&gt;&gt;1.68

Therefore, the values of u and e are:
u = 1.68
e = 1.86

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the substitution method.

1. Solve the first equation for p in terms of n:
   57p + 4n = 129
   57p = 129 - 4n
   p = (129 - 4n) / 57

2. Substitute the expression for p into the second equation:
   24p + 39n = 154
   24((129 - 4n) / 57) + 39n = 154

3. Simplify the equation:
   (24(129 - 4n) / 57) + 39n = 154
   (3096 - 96n) / 57 + 39n = 154
   3096/57 - 96n/57 + 39n = 154
   54.3157895 - 1.6842105n + 39n = 154
   37.3157895n + 54.3157895 = 154
   37.3157895n = 99.6842105
   n = 99.6842105 / 37.3157895
   n = 2.67

4. Substitute n = 2.67 into the equation for p from step 1:
   p = (129 - 4n) / 57
   p = (129 - 4(2.67)) / 57
   p = (129 - 10.68) / 57
   p = 118.32 / 57
   p = 2.075

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the given system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other using the first equation, then substitute it into the second equation to solve for the remaining variable.

Given equations:
66 * z - 44 * y = 32 ... (1)
60 * y + 14 * z = 116 ... (2)

Step 1: Solve equation (1) for y in terms of z.
66 * z - 44 * y = 32
-44 * y = -66 * z + 32
y = (66 * z - 32) / 44
y = (33 * z - 16) / 22 ... (3)

Step 2: Substitute equation (3) into equation (2) and solve for z.
60 * ((33 * z - 16) / 22) + 14 * z = 116
(1980 * z - 960) / 22 + 14 * z = 116
1980 * z - 960 + 308 * z = 2552
2288 * z - 960 = 2552
2288 * z = 3512
z = 3512 / 2288
z = &lt;&lt;3512/2288=1.535&gt;&gt;1.535

Given equations:
1. 83t - 58h = 45
2. 69h + 11t = 124

Step 1: Solve the first equation for t in terms of h.
83t - 58h = 45
83t = 58h + 45
t = (58h + 45) / 83

Step 2: Substitute the expression for t into the second equation.
69h + 11((58h + 45) / 83) = 124

Step 3: Simplify the equation and solve for h.
69h + (638h + 495) / 83 = 124

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this system of equations step by step using the substitution method.

Given equations:
1. ((79 * h) - (61 * o)) = 9
2. ((16 * h) - (12 * o)) = 9

Step 1: Simplify equation 2 to isolate h in terms of o.
((16 * h) - (12 * o)) = 9
16h - 12o = 9
16h = 12o + 9
h = (12o + 9) / 16
h = (3o + 9/4) / 4
h = (3/4)o + 9/16

Step 2: Substitute the expression for h into equation 1.
((79 * h) - (61 * o)) = 9
(79 * ((3/4)o + 9/16)) - (61 * o) = 9
(237/4)o + 711/16 - 61o = 9

Step 3: Simplify the equation and solve for o.
(237/4)o - 61o + 711/16 = 9
(237/4 - 61)o + 711/16 = 9
(237/4 - 244/4)o + 711/16 = 9
(-7/4)o + 711/16 = 9
-7o/4 = 9 - 711/16
-7o/4 = (144 - 711)/16
-7o/4 = -567/16
-7o = -567/4
o = 81/7

Step 4: Substitute the value of o into the expression for h to find its value.
h = (3/4)o + 9/16
h = (3/4)(81/7) + 9/16
h = 243/28 + 9/16
h = (243/28 + 63/112)
h = (243 + 63)/28
h = 306/28
h = 153/14

Given equations:
4y + 56s = 139 ... (1)

Step 1: Solve equation (1) for y in terms of s.
4y + 56s = 139
4y = 139 - 56s
y = (139 - 56s) ÷ 4
y = 34.75 - 14s ... (3)

Step 2: Substitute the expression for y from equation (3) into equation (2).
65(34.75 - 14s) - 90s = 16
2258.75 - 910s - 90s = 16
2258.75 - 1000s = 16
-1000s = 16 - 2258.75

Given equations:

Step 1: Solve equation (1) for d in terms of z.
42 * d - 4 * z = 75
42 * d = 75 + 4 * z
d = (75 + 4 * z) / 42
d = 75/42 + (4/42) * z
d = 25/14 + (1/21) * z ... (3)

Step 2: Substitute the expression for d from equation (3) into equation (2).
40 * (25/14 + (1/21) * z) + 45 * z = 162
1000/14 + 40/21 * z + 45 * z = 162
1000/14 + (40/21 + 45) * z = 162
1000/14 + (200/21 + 945/21) * z = 162
1000/14 + 1145/21 * z = 162

Step 3: Solve the resulting equation for z.
1000/14 + 1145/21 * z = 162
1145/21 * z = 162 - 1000/14
1145/21 * z = (3402 - 1500)/42
1145/21 * z = 1902/42
z = (1902/42) / (1145/21)
z = (1902/42) * (21/1145)
z = 1902 / (42 * 1145)
z = 1902 / 48090

1. From the first equation, express 'o' in terms of 'a':
   (42 * o) + (24 * a) = 142
   42o = 142 - 24a
   o = (142 - 24a) / 42
   o = 142/42 - 24a/42
   o = 3.380952381 - 0.5714285714a

2. Substitute the expression for 'o' into the second equation:
   (42 * a) + (6 * (3.380952381 - 0.5714285714a)) = 75
   42a + 20.28571429 - 3.428571429a = 75
   38.57142857a + 20.28571429 = 75
   38.57142857a = 54.71428571
   a = 54.71428571 / 38.57142857

3. Substitute the value of 'a' back into the expression for 'o':

From the first equation, 39*r - 2*p = 45, let's solve for p:
39*r - 2*p = 45
-2*p = -39*r + 45
p = (39*r - 45) / 2

Now, substitute this expression for p into the second equation:
16*p - 84*r = 36
16*((39*r - 45) / 2) - 84*r = 36
(16*(39*r - 45)) / 2 - 84*r = 36
(624*r - 720) / 2 - 84*r = 36
312*r - 360 - 84*r = 36
228*r - 360 = 36
228*r = 396
r = 396 / 228
r = &lt;&lt;396/228=1.7368421052631578&gt;&gt;1.7368421052631578

Now that we have the value of r, we can substitute it back into the expression for p:

        Given the following system of equations, solve for the values of 'd' and 'w':

1. (23 * d) - (52 * w) = 7
2. (64 * w) - (8 * d) = 58
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve for the values of 'd' and 'w', we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for 'd' in terms of 'w' using the first equation, then substitute this expression into the second equation to solve for 'w'.

From equation 1: (23 * d) - (52 * w) = 7
23d - 52w = 7
23d = 52w + 7
d = (52w + 7) / 23
d = (52/23)w + (7/23)

Now, substitute this expression for 'd' into equation 2:
64w - 8((52/23)w + (7/23)) = 58
64w - (416/23)w - (56/23) = 58
(1472/23)w - (416/23)w = 58 + (56/23)
(1056/23)w = (1398/23)
w = (1398/1056)
w = &lt;&lt;1398/1056=1.323863636363636&gt;&gt;1.32

Now that we have the value for 'w', we can substitute it back into the expression for 'd':
d = (52/23)w + (7/23)
d = (52/23)(1.32) + (7/23)
d = 2.98 + 0.30
d = &lt;&lt;2.98+0.30=3.28&gt;&gt;3.28

        Solve the following system of equations for the values of n and z: 

(71 * z) + (60 * n) = 184 
(52 * z) - (47 * n) = 19.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation.

From the first equation, let's solve for n:
(71 * z) + (60 * n) = 184
60 * n = 184 - (71 * z)
n = (184 - (71 * z)) / 60

Now, substitute the expression for n into the second equation:
(52 * z) - (47 * ((184 - (71 * z)) / 60)) = 19

Simplify:
(52 * z) - (47 * (184 - (71 * z))) / 60 = 19
(52 * z) - ((8648 - (3337 * z)) / 60) = 19
(52 * z) - (144.1333... - (55.6166... * z)) = 19
(52 * z) - 144.1333... + (55.6166... * z) = 19
(107.6166... * z) - 144.1333... = 19
(107.6166... * z) = 163.1333...
z = 163.1333... / 107.6166...
z = 1.5161290322580645

Now that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into the expression for n:
n = (184 - (71 * 1.5161290322580645)) / 60
n = (184 - 107.64516129032258) / 60
n = 76.35483870967742 / 60
n = 1.2725806451612903

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:
z ≈ 1.5161290322580645
n ≈ 1.2725806451612903

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the given system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other using the first equation, then substitute it into the second equation to solve for the remaining variable.

Given equations:
70 * e + 90 * z = 189 ... (1)
99 * z - 84 * e = 20 ... (2)

Step 1: Solve equation (1) for z in terms of e.
70 * e + 90 * z = 189
90 * z = 189 - 70 * e
z = (189 - 70 * e) / 90
z = 2.1 - (7/9) * e ... (3)

Step 2: Substitute the expression for z from equation (3) into equation (2).
99 * (2.1 - (7/9) * e) - 84 * e = 20
207.9 - 77 * e - 84 * e = 20
207.9 - 161 * e = 20
-161 * e = -187.9
e = 187.9 / 161
e ≈ 1.167 ... (4)

Step 3: Substitute the value of e from equation (4) into equation (3) to find z.
z = 2.1 - (7/9) * 1.167
z = 2.1 - 0.907
z ≈ 1.193 ... (5)

Therefore, the values of e and z are approximately:

        Find the values of o and f that satisfy the following system of equations:

2) 87f + 11o = 169.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve equation (1) for o in terms of f, then substitute the expression for o into equation (2) to solve for f. Finally, we'll substitute the value of f back into equation (1) to find o.

From equation (1), we have:
26o - 44f = 95
26o = 44f + 95
o = (44f + 95) / 26
o = (44/26)f + 95/26

Now, let's substitute this expression for o into equation (2):
87f + 11((44/26)f + 95/26) = 169
87f + (484/26)f + 1045/26 = 169
(87 + 484/26)f = 169 - 1045/26
(2262/26 + 484/26)f = 169 - 1045/26
(2746/26)f = 169 - 1045/26
f = (169 - 1045/26) / (2746/26)
f = (4394 - 1045) / 2746
f = 3349 / 2746
f = &lt;&lt;3349/2746=1.22&gt;&gt;1.22

Now that we have the value of f, let's substitute it back into the equation for o:
o = (44/26)f + 95/26
o = (44/26)(1.22) + 95/26
o = &lt;&lt;(44/26)*(1.22)+(95/26)=5.32&gt;&gt;5.32

Therefore, the values that satisfy the system of equations are:

        Calculate the values of z and p using the following system of equations: 40*z - 20*p = 51
 6*z + 58*p = 165.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve for z and p, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for z in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation to solve for p.

1. Solve for z in the first equation:
   40*z - 20*p = 51
   40*z = 51 + 20*p
   z = (51 + 20*p) / 40
   z = 51/40 + (20/40)*p
   z = 1.275 + 0.5*p

2. Substitute z into the second equation:
   6*z + 58*p = 165
   6*(1.275 + 0.5*p) + 58*p = 165
   7.65 + 3*p + 58*p = 165
   7.65 + 61*p = 165
   61*p = 165 - 7.65
   61*p = 157.35
   p = 157.35 / 61
   p = 2.58

3. Substitute p back into the equation for z:
   z = 1.275 + 0.5*p
   z = 1.275 + 0.5*2.58
   z = 1.275 + 1.29
   z = 2.565

        Find the values of s and f from the given system of equations:

(71 * s) - (89 * f) = 5 
(3 * f) + (10 * s) = 93.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve for s and f, we can use the substitution method. Let's solve for one variable in terms of the other using the second equation and then substitute it into the first equation.

From the second equation, we can solve for f in terms of s:
(3 * f) + (10 * s) = 93
3f = 93 - 10s
f = (93 - 10s) / 3
f = 31 - (10s / 3)

Now, let's substitute this expression for f into the first equation:
(71 * s) - (89 * f) = 5
(71 * s) - (89 * (31 - (10s / 3))) = 5
(71 * s) - (2759 - (890s / 3)) = 5
(71 * s) - 2759 + (890s / 3) = 5
71s + (890s / 3) = 2764
213s + 890s = 8292
1103s = 8292
s = 8292 / 1103
s = &lt;&lt;8292/1103=752/103&gt;&gt;752/103

Now that we have the value of s, we can substitute it back into the expression for f:
f = 31 - (10s / 3)
f = 31 - (10 * (752/103) / 3)
f = 31 - (7520/309)
f = (9579/309) - (7520/309)
f = 2059/309

Therefore, the values of s and f are:
