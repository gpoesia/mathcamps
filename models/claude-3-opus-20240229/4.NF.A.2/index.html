        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions 1/8 and 4/1, we need to convert them to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

1/8 is already in its simplest form.

4/1 can be written as an improper fraction, and it is equal to 4.

Now, let's convert 4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 8:
4 Ã— 8/8 = 32/8

Comparing 1/8 and 32/8, we can see that 1/8 is less than 32/8.

Therefore, (1 / 8) &lt; (4 / 1).

6/8 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:
6/8 = 3/4

4/1 can be written as an improper fraction, and it is equal to 4.

Now, let's convert 4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 4:
4 Ã— 4/4 = 16/4

Comparing 3/4 and 16/4, we can see that 3/4 is less than 16/4.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great question! Let's compare these two fractions: (3/7) and (9/10).

To compare the fractions, we'll find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 10 is 70.

(3/7) = (3 Ã— 10)/(7 Ã— 10) = 30/70
(9/10) = (9 Ã— 7)/(10 Ã— 7) = 63/70

Now, we can compare the numerators:
30/70 _ 63/70

Since 30 &lt; 63, we have:
30/70 &lt; 63/70

Therefore, (3/7) &lt; (9/10)

Impact of decreasing the numerator:
In the previous problem, we compared (3/2) and (9/10), and found that (3/2) &gt; (9/10). However, in this problem, we decreased the numerator of the first fraction from 3/2 to 3/7.

By decreasing the numerator while keeping the second fraction constant, the first fraction becomes smaller. This is because 3/7 is less than 3/2 (you can verify this by converting both to decimals or finding a common denominator).

As a result, the comparison between (3/7) and (9/10) is different from the comparison between (3/2) and (9/10). The decrease in the numerator of the first fraction caused the comparison to change from &gt; to &lt;.

### Answer: The comparison is different. (3/7) &lt; (9/10), whereas (3/2) &gt; (9/10).</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions 10/9 and 5/6, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 6 is 18.

Let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 18:

10/9 = (10 * 2)/(9 * 2) = 20/18
5/6 = (5 * 3)/(6 * 3) = 15/18

Now we can compare the numerators:

20/18 &gt; 15/18 because 20 &gt; 15

Therefore, (10/9) &gt; (5/6)

First, simplify 9/9:
9/9 = 1

Now, we need to compare 1 and 6/4. To do this, we can convert 6/4 to a mixed number or an improper fraction.

6/4 = 1 2/4 = 1 1/2

We know that 1 &lt; 1 1/2, so 1 &lt; 6/4.

Therefore, (9 / 9) &lt; (6 / 4).

The relational comparison changes from &lt; to &lt; when the numerator of the first fraction changes from 8 to 9 (effectively making it 1), while the second fraction remains the same.

Therefore, (10/3) &gt; (10/10)

When the denominator of the second fraction is increased from 2 to 10, the comparison changes from &lt; to &gt;. This is because as the denominator increases, the fraction becomes smaller. In this case, 10/10 = 1, which is less than 10/3 (approximately 3.33).

Compare the value of the fractions (3 / 7) and (6 / 8) by filling in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =:

Find the least common multiple of 7 and 8, which is 56.

Multiply the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the number that will result in the denominator of 56:

(3/7) = (3 Ã— 8)/(7 Ã— 8) = 24/56
(6/8) = (6 Ã— 7)/(8 Ã— 7) = 42/56

Now compare the numerators:

Therefore, (3/7) &lt; (6/8)

This comparison shows that 6 parts out of 8 is greater than 3 parts out of 7, just as 5 parts out of 8 was greater than 3 parts out of 7 in the previous example. The difference between the fractions in this case (6/8 - 3/7) is even larger than the difference in the previous case (5/8 - 3/7).

3/1 = (3 Ã— 9)/(1 Ã— 9) = 27/9
5/9 remains as 5/9

Comparing 27/9 and 5/9, we see that 27/9 is greater than 5/9.

Find the common denominator for 7 and 4, which is 28 (their least common multiple).

Multiply the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the number that will make the denominator 28:

(2 / 7) = (2 Ã— 4) / (7 Ã— 4) = 8 / 28
(2 / 4) = (2 Ã— 7) / (4 Ã— 7) = 14 / 28

Now compare the numerators:
8 &lt; 14

Therefore, (2 / 7) &lt; (2 / 4).

Yes, the outcome changes when we adjust the denominator in the second fraction from 9 to 4. In the previous question, (2 / 7) was greater than (2 / 9), but in this case, (2 / 7) is less than (2 / 4).

This is because 1/4 is greater than 1/7, so when we have the same numerator (2), the fraction with the smaller denominator will be larger.

Method 1: Converting to decimals
9 / 10 = 0.9
7 / 1 = 7

Since 0.9 &lt; 7, we can conclude that 9 / 10 &lt; 7 / 1.

Method 2: Finding a common denominator
The common denominator is 10 Ã— 1 = 10.

(9 / 10) = (9 / 10)
(7 / 1) = (70 / 10)

Since 9 &lt; 70, we can conclude that 9 / 10 &lt; 7 / 1.

Therefore, the relation between the two fractions is:

(9 / 10) &lt; (7 / 1)

Comparing to the previous fractions:
In the previous problem, we compared (9 / 4) and (7 / 1), and found that (9 / 4) &lt; (7 / 1).
In this problem, we compared (9 / 10) and (7 / 1), and found that (9 / 10) &lt; (7 / 1).

The answer has not changed; in both cases, the fraction with 7 as the numerator is greater than the fraction with 9 as the numerator. However, the difference between the fractions has changed:

(9 / 4) = 2.25, which is closer to 7 than (9 / 10) = 0.9 is to 7.

### Answer: The relation between (9 / 10) and (7 / 1) is &lt;, which is the same as the relation between (9 / 4) and (7 / 1). The answer has not changed, but the difference between the fractions is greater in the new comparison.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's convert both fractions to have a common denominator. The common denominator will be the product of the two denominators: 8 * 1 = 8.

2) Now, let's convert each fraction:

   (4 / 8) is already in eighths, so it doesn't change.
   
   (2 / 1) = (2 * 8) / (1 * 8) = 16 / 8

3) Now we have:

   (4 / 8) _ (16 / 8)

4) Since the denominators are the same, we can compare the numerators directly:

   4 &lt; 16

5) Therefore, (4 / 8) &lt; (2 / 1)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this step by step:

1) As before, let's convert both fractions to have a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of the two denominators: LCM(8, 6) = 24.

2) Now, let's convert each fraction:

   (4 / 8) = (4 * 3) / (8 * 3) = 12 / 24
   
   (2 / 6) = (2 * 4) / (6 * 4) = 8 / 24

3) Now we have:

   (12 / 24) _ (8 / 24)

4) Since the denominators are the same, we can compare the numerators directly:

   12 &gt; 8

5) Therefore, (4 / 8) &gt; (2 / 6)

Therefore, (9 / 3) &gt; (2 / 2)

Explanation: When we changed the denominator of the first fraction from 9 to 3, it increased the value of the fraction. This is because dividing a number by a smaller number results in a larger quotient. In this case, 9 divided by 3 is greater than 9 divided by 9, making the first fraction (9 / 3) greater than the second fraction (2 / 2).

Reflect on the previous question and this question and see how changing the denominator in the second fraction affects the relation between the two fractions.

            <span class="response-field">Claude-3 Opus:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous question, we compared 3/9 and 8/8. We found that 3/9 &lt; 8/8 because when we converted both fractions to a common denominator of 72, we got 24/72 &lt; 72/72.

Now, let's compare 3/9 and 8/3.

First, convert both fractions to a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 3 is 9.

3/9 is already in ninths, so it doesn't change.
8/3 = (8 Ã— 3)/(3 Ã— 3) = 24/9

Now we can compare the numerators:

3/9 &lt; 24/9

Therefore, (3 / 9) &lt; (8 / 3)

Reflection:
In the first question, the denominator of the second fraction was 8, and 3/9 was less than 8/8. In this question, the denominator of the second fraction changed to 3, and 3/9 is still less than 8/3.

This shows that when comparing fractions, the denominator plays a crucial role. In this case, changing the denominator from 8 to 3 in the second fraction made the inequality even more pronounced. This is because 1/3 is greater than 1/8, so when we multiply the numerator and denominator of 8/3 by 3 to get a common denominator, the resulting fraction (24/9) is much larger than 3/9.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's frame the comparison (6/4) _ (6/3) into a question:

Is the fraction 6/4 less than, greater than, or equal to the fraction 6/3?

To answer this question, we can compare the fractions by converting them to equivalent fractions with a common denominator, just like we did in the previous problem.

(6/4) = (6/4) Ã— (3/3) = 18/12 = 3/2 = 1.5
(6/3) = (6/3) Ã— (4/4) = 24/12 = 2

Now we can compare:
1.5 &lt; 2

Therefore, (6/4) &lt; (6/3)

The change in denominator does not affect the outcome of the comparison. In both cases, the fraction with the denominator 3 is greater than the fraction with the other denominator (6 in the first question and 4 in the second question).

This is because when the numerators are the same, the fraction with the smaller denominator will always be greater. In this case, 3 is smaller than both 6 and 4, so 6/3 is greater than both 6/6 and 6/4.

### Answer: The change in denominator does not affect the outcome of the comparison. In both cases, (6/6) &lt; (6/3) and (6/4) &lt; (6/3).</pre>

Converting both fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 20:

When we increase the numerator of the first fraction from 2 to 6, the comparison remains the same. The fraction 6/10 is still less than 6/4.

This is because although the numerator of the first fraction increased, it is still proportionally smaller than the second fraction when compared with the same denominator.

Now, we are comparing 1/9 and 7/7.

First, let's simplify 7/7:

So, the comparison becomes:

To compare fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 9.

1 = 9/9

Now, the comparison becomes:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions 2/7 and 1/6, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 6 is 42.

Let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 42:

2/7 = (2 Ã— 6)/(7 Ã— 6) = 12/42
1/6 = (1 Ã— 7)/(6 Ã— 7) = 7/42

Now we can compare the numerators:

12/42 &gt; 7/42

Therefore, 2/7 &gt; 1/6.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions 8/4 and 5/2, let's first simplify each fraction:

8/4 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 4:
8 Ã· 4 = 2
4 Ã· 4 = 1
Therefore, 8/4 simplifies to 2/1, which equals 2.

5/2 is already in its simplest form and cannot be reduced further.

Now we can compare the simplified fractions:
2 _ 5/2

To compare these, we need to convert them to the same denominator. The common denominator is 2. Since 2 is already a whole number, we only need to multiply both the numerator and denominator of 5/2 by 2:

5 Ã— 2 = 10
2 Ã— 2 = 4
So, 5/2 is equal to 10/4.

Comparing 2 and 10/4:
2 = 8/4
8/4 &lt; 10/4

Therefore, 8/4 &lt; 5/2.

Therefore, 10/4 simplifies to 5/2.

5/2 is already in its simplest form.

(1/10) is already in the correct form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's compare the fractions 6/3 and 8/4 by converting them to equivalent fractions with a common denominator, just like we did in the previous question.

6/3 = (6 Ã— 4)/(3 Ã— 4) = 24/12
8/4 = (8 Ã— 3)/(4 Ã— 3) = 24/12

Now we have:
24/12 _ 24/12

Since both fractions are equal, we can conclude that:

24/12 = 24/12

Therefore, (6/3) = (8/4)

3/4 = (3 Ã— 9)/(4 Ã— 9) = 27/36
6/9 = (6 Ã— 4)/(9 Ã— 4) = 24/36

Now we can compare the numerators:

27/36 &gt; 24/36

Therefore, (3 / 4) &gt; (6 / 9)

When the second fraction changes from 6/5 to 6/9, the comparison between the two fractions changes as well. In the previous example, 3/4 was less than 6/5, but now 3/4 is greater than 6/9.

This change occurs because 6/9 is a smaller fraction than 6/5. When dividing 6 by a larger number (9 instead of 5), the resulting fraction becomes smaller. As a result, 3/4 is now greater than the second fraction, 6/9.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's compare (1 / 1) and (3 / 7).

We already know that (1 / 1) = 1.

To compare (3 / 7) with 1, we can convert (3 / 7) to a decimal or find a common denominator.

Converting (3 / 7) to a decimal:
(3 / 7) â‰ˆ 0.4285714...

Since 0.4285714... &lt; 1, we know that (3 / 7) &lt; (1 / 1).

Alternatively, we can find a common denominator:
(1 / 1) = (7 / 7)
(3 / 7) remains as is.

Now, we can compare the numerators:
7 &gt; 3, so (7 / 7) &gt; (3 / 7).

Therefore, (1 / 1) &gt; (3 / 7).

6/4 = 3/2 = 1.5
2/10 = 1/5 = 0.2

Now we can easily compare 1.5 and 0.2.

Since 1.5 &gt; 0.2, we have:
(6 / 4) &gt; (2 / 10)

In the original problem, the denominator of the second fraction was 2, and (6 / 4) &gt; (2 / 2). By changing the denominator of the second fraction from 2 to 10, the value of the second fraction decreased from 1 to 0.2.

This change in the denominator made the inequality even more pronounced because 1.5 is much greater than 0.2, compared to 1.5 being greater than 1 in the original problem.

Therefore, changing the denominator of the second fraction from 2 to 10 did not affect the direction of the inequality; it only made the difference between the two fractions more significant.

If we have a cake sliced into 5 equal pieces and we take 4 of those pieces, we have 4/5 of the cake. Similarly, if we have a cake sliced into 10 equal pieces and we take 9 of those pieces, we have 9/10 of the cake.

To compare these fractions, let's convert them to a common denominator as we did before. The common denominator is the LCM of 5 and 10, which is 10.

4/5 = (4 Ã— 2)/(5 Ã— 2) = 8/10
9/10 remains as 9/10

Now, comparing the numerators:

8 &lt; 9

Therefore, 4/5 &lt; 9/10

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great question! Let's compare these fractions using the same method as before.

First, find the LCM of the denominators 9 and 10:
LCM(9, 10) = 90

Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 90:

(5 / 9) = (5 Ã— 10) / (9 Ã— 10) = 50 / 90
(4 / 10) = (4 Ã— 9) / (10 Ã— 9) = 36 / 90

Comparing the numerators:
50 &gt; 36

Therefore, (5 / 9) &gt; (4 / 10)

When we change the denominator of the second fraction from 7 to 10, the comparison changes from &lt; to &gt;. This is because 4/10 is smaller than 4/7.

To understand why, consider that 4/7 is closer to 1 than 4/10. As the denominator increases, the fraction becomes smaller (assuming the numerator remains the same). In this case, 4/10 is a smaller portion of the whole than 4/7, so (5 / 9) is now greater than (4 / 10).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's approach this problem step-by-step as well.

1) As before, let's simplify the fractions if possible.
   - 5/1 is already in its simplest form. It's equal to 5.
   - 7/2 is a proper fraction and cannot be simplified further.

2) Now our equation looks like this: 5 _ 7/2

3) To compare a whole number and a fraction, it's often helpful to convert the whole number into a fraction with the same denominator as the fraction we're comparing it to.
   - 5 can be written as 10/2 (since 5 = 10/2)

4) Now we have: 10/2 _ 7/2

5) Comparing fractions with the same denominator is straightforward. We just need to compare the numerators. 10 is greater than 7.

6) Therefore, 10/2 &gt; 7/2, which means 5 &gt; 7/2.

The correct sign to replace the underscore is &quot;&gt;&quot;.

The final equation is: (5 / 1) &gt; (7 / 2)

This result is the same as the previous problem. The fraction on the left (5/1) is still greater than the fraction on the right (7/2).

5/8 = 5 * 1 / 8 * 1 = 5/8
To get a denominator of 3, we can multiply by 3/3.
5/8 * 3/3 = 15/24

Now we can compare 15/24 and 3/3.

15/24 = 0.625

Now, let's convert 5/4 to a mixed number or an improper fraction.

5/4 = 1 1/4 (mixed number) or 5/4 (improper fraction)

We can see that 5/4 is greater than 1 because it represents more than one whole unit.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the same vein as the previous problem, consider a new comparison: 
(5 / 8) _ (6 / 5).

Which symbol: &lt;, &gt;, or =, correctly complete the comparison? Keep in mind how your answer might change compared to the previous problem because of the different denominator in the second fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine which symbol (&lt;, &gt;, or =) is appropriate to fill in the blank, we need to compare the fractions 5/8 and 6/5.

Step 1: Find a common denominator for the fractions.
The least common multiple of 8 and 5 is 40. So, we will convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 40.

5/8 = 5 Ã— 5 / 8 Ã— 5 = 25/40
6/5 = 6 Ã— 8 / 5 Ã— 8 = 48/40

Step 2: Compare the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
25/40 and 48/40 have the same denominator, so we can compare their numerators.
25 &lt; 48

Therefore, 5/8 &lt; 6/5, and the appropriate symbol to fill in the blank is &quot;&lt;&quot;.

(5 / 8) &lt; (6 / 5)

Note: In the previous problem, the second fraction (6/10) had a larger denominator than the first fraction (5/8), which made the second fraction smaller. In this problem, the second fraction (6/5) has a smaller denominator than the first fraction (5/8), which makes the second fraction larger.

Multiply the second fraction by 5/5 (which equals 1) to get an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 30:

5/10 represents having 5 parts out of 10 equal parts. This means that you have half (0.5) of the whole.

6/1 represents having 6 wholes, as any whole number can be represented as that number over 1.

Now, let's compare:
0.5 (which is equivalent to 5/10) &lt; 6 (which is equivalent to 6/1)

In terms of the apples and oranges analogy, if you have 5 apples out of a total of 10 equal parts, that is less than having 6 whole oranges.

Therefore, (5/10) &lt; (6/1)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions (1 / 1) and (2 / 10), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1 and 10 is 10. So, we will convert (1 / 1) to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 10.

(1 / 1) = (1 Ã— 10) / (1 Ã— 10) = 10 / 10

1) We already know from the previous question that:
   
   8 / 2 = 4

2) Now, let's calculate the value of 9 / 9:

Therefore, the correct symbol to fill in the blank is &quot;&gt;&quot;.

(8 / 2) &gt; (9 / 9)

When the denominator of the second fraction is 9 instead of 10, the value of the second fraction becomes 1 (because any number divided by itself is 1). This is less than the value of the second fraction in the previous question (which was approximately 1.11).

However, this change does not affect the overall inequality. In both cases, the first fraction (8 / 2) is greater than the second fraction, whether the second fraction is 10 / 9 or 9 / 9.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's compare the fractions 3/2 and 9/6 by finding a common denominator, as we did in the previous example.

The least common multiple of 2 and 6 is 6. So, let's convert 3/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6.

(3/2) = (3 Ã— 3)/(2 Ã— 3) = 9/6
(9/6) remains as it is.

Now, we can compare the numerators:
9/6 = 9/6 because 9 = 9

Therefore, (3/2) = (9/6)

If the denominator of the second fraction was 6 instead of 8, it would change the answer. In the previous example, 3/2 was greater than 9/8. However, in this case, 3/2 is equal to 9/6. This is because when we convert 3/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6, we get 9/6, which is the same as the second fraction.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Considering the previous question, what if we change the first fraction to 3 / 5 instead of 6 / 5? 

So the question becomes:

(3 / 5) _ (9 / 6)

Again, fill in the blank with the correct symbol â€“ is it &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, or &quot;=&quot; ?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's compare the new fraction (3 / 5) with (9 / 6) by finding a common denominator.

(3 / 5) = (3 * 6) / (5 * 6) = 18 / 30 = 3 / 5
(9 / 6) = (9 * 5) / (6 * 5) = 45 / 30 = 3 / 2

Now we can compare 3/5 and 3/2:

3/5 = 0.6
3/2 = 1.5

Since 0.6 &lt; 1.5, we can conclude that (3 / 5) &lt; (9 / 6).

Therefore, the correct symbol to fill in the blank is &quot;&lt;&quot;.

(3 / 5) &lt; (9 / 6)

            Let's consider a variation of the previous problem. Now require the comparison of two different fractions:

(1 / 5) _ (1 / 10)

Use &lt;, &gt; or = to complete the comparison. This question asks you to think about what happens when we change the number of parts the whole is divided into.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this problem, we are comparing the fractions 1/5 and 1/10.

Both fractions have a numerator of 1, but the denominators are different. In fraction notation, the denominator represents the number of equal parts the whole is divided into. A larger denominator means the whole is divided into more parts, resulting in smaller parts.

1/5 means the whole is divided into 5 equal parts, and we are considering 1 of those parts.
1/10 means the whole is divided into 10 equal parts, and we are considering 1 of those parts.

Since 10 is greater than 5, the parts in 1/10 are smaller than the parts in 1/5. Therefore, 1/5 is greater than 1/10.

(1/5) &gt; (1/10)

This comparison shows that when we divide a whole into more parts (larger denominator), each part becomes smaller.

            Consider the following fractions and use &lt;, &gt;, or = to fill the blank: 
(10 / 10) _ (4 / 9)

This is very similar to the last problem where we compared (10 / 10) to (4 / 10). What changes when the denominator of the second fraction is now 9 instead of 10?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this case, we are comparing the fractions 10/10 and 4/9.

10/10 = 1 (or 100%)
4/9 â‰ˆ 0.444 (or 44.4%)

Although the denominator of the second fraction has changed from 10 to 9, the value of 4/9 is still less than 1.

The reason for this is that when comparing fractions with different denominators, the fraction with the smaller denominator will be larger if the numerators are the same. In this case, 4/9 is larger than 4/10 because ninths are larger than tenths.

However, even though 4/9 is larger than 4/10, it is still smaller than 1 (which is equal to 10/10).

Therefore, the correct symbol to fill in the blank is still &quot;&gt;&quot;.

(10 / 10) &gt; (4 / 9)

Therefore, (9 / 3) &gt; (4 / 2)

In the previous situation, the second fraction (4 / 8) was equal to 1/2, which is less than (9 / 3) = 3. However, in this case, the second fraction (4 / 2) is equal to 2, which is still less than (9 / 3) = 3. The comparison remains the same, with (9 / 3) being greater than the second fraction.

Comparing this result with the previous problem:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions 4/10 and 9/2, we need to convert them to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

To find the common denominator, we calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 2.
LCM(10, 2) = 10

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator of 10:

(4/10) = (4/10) Ã— 1 = 4/10

(9/2) = (9/2) Ã— 5/5 = 45/10

Comparing 4/10 and 45/10:

4/10 &lt; 45/10

Therefore, (4/10) &lt; (9/2)

            Consider a continuation of the previous comparison of fractions. Now, compare the following fractions by filling in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =.

(9 / 7) _ (10 / 7)

In other words, what would happen if the denominator of the second fraction was 7 instead of 3, keeping the ratio of 9 to 7 in the first fraction the same? How would this change affect the comparison?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this case, we have the fractions 9/7 and 10/7. Since both fractions have the same denominator, we can directly compare their numerators.

9 &lt; 10

Therefore, (9/7) &lt; (10/7)

The change in the denominator of the second fraction from 3 to 7 affects the comparison in the following way:

1. In the original comparison, (9/7) was less than (10/3) because when we found a common denominator, the equivalent fractions were 27/21 and 70/21, respectively. The numerator of the second fraction (70) was much larger than the numerator of the first fraction (27).

2. In the new comparison, (9/7) is still less than (10/7), but the difference between the fractions is smaller. This is because the numerators (9 and 10) are now much closer in value, and the denominator is the same for both fractions.

In summary, changing the denominator of the second fraction from 3 to 7 reduces the difference between the two fractions, but the overall comparison remains the same: (9/7) is still less than the second fraction.

To compare fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 8 is 40. So, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 40.

8/10 = (8 Ã— 4)/(10 Ã— 4) = 32/40
2/8 = (2 Ã— 5)/(8 Ã— 5) = 10/40

Now we can compare 32/40 and 10/40.

32/40 is greater than 10/40 because 32 parts out of 40 is more than 10 parts out of 40.

Therefore, 8/10 &gt; 2/8.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's compare the fractions 9/6 and 4/8 by converting them to equivalent fractions with the same denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24.

9/6 = (9 Ã— 4)/(6 Ã— 4) = 36/24
4/8 = (4 Ã— 3)/(8 Ã— 3) = 12/24

Now, we can compare the numerators:
36/24 &gt; 12/24 because 36 &gt; 12

Therefore, (9/6) &gt; (4/8)

The change in the numerator of the second fraction from 6 to 4 does not affect the comparison method. We still convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator and then compare the numerators. However, the reduction in the numerator of the second fraction makes the difference between the two fractions even larger than in the previous problem.

LCM(6, 7) = 42

Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator of 42:

2/6 = (2 Ã— 7)/(6 Ã— 7) = 14/42
8/7 = (8 Ã— 6)/(7 Ã— 6) = 48/42

Comparing 14/42 and 48/42, we see that 14/42 &lt; 48/42.

Intuitively, if you have 2 out of 7 parts of a pizza and someone else has 8 out of 7 parts, they have more than a whole pizza, while you have less than a third of a pizza. So, your fraction is smaller than theirs.

Multiplying the numerator and denominator of 4/6 by 3:
(4/6) Ã— (3/3) = 12/18

Multiplying the numerator and denominator of 5/3 by 2:

Now we have:

Simplifying 10/6 to the lowest terms:

Comparing 12/18 and 5/3:

5/3 = 1 2/3

Since 2/3 &lt; 1 2/3, we can conclude that:

In the previous problem, we compared 4/6 and 6/3, and found that 4/6 &lt; 6/3. In this problem, we decreased the numerator in the second fraction from 6 to 5, resulting in 5/3. However, the result remains the same: 4/6 is still less than 5/3.

This is because 5/3 is still greater than 1 (5/3 = 1 2/3), while 4/6 is less than 1 (4/6 = 2/3). Changing the numerator from 6 to 5 in the second fraction does not affect the inequality, as long as the second fraction remains greater than the first fraction.

6/7 = 6/7
3/1 = (3 Ã— 7)/(1 Ã— 7) = 21/7

Comparing the numerators:

6 &lt; 21

Therefore, 6/7 &lt; 3/1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions 6/7 and 9/1, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 1.

LCM(7, 1) = 7

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

6/7 = 6/7
9/1 = (9 Ã— 7)/(1 Ã— 7) = 63/7

Comparing the numerators:

6 &lt; 63

Since 6 is less than 9, we can conclude that:

            Now, consider if the fraction had been different. Compare the following fractions:

(1 / 10) _ (9 / 10)

How would your answer change from the previous question where you compared (6 / 10) and (9 / 10)?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous question, we compared (6 / 10) and (9 / 10) and found that (6 / 10) &lt; (9 / 10).

Now, we are comparing (1 / 10) and (9 / 10). Similar to the previous question, both fractions have the same denominator of 10, so we can directly compare the numerators.

1/10 has a numerator of 1, and 9/10 has a numerator of 9.

Since 1 is also less than 9, we can conclude that:

(1 / 10) &lt; (9 / 10)

Therefore, the answer remains the same as the previous question. The blank should be filled with the less than symbol (&lt;).

The only difference between the two questions is the value of the first fraction being compared. In both cases, the first fraction has a smaller numerator than the second fraction, resulting in the same inequality.

Multiply the first fraction by 9/9 and the second fraction by 8/8 to get equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

(6/8) * (9/9) = 54/72
(4/9) * (8/8) = 32/72

Now we can compare the numerators:
