        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Calculate how much money Steve spent each day:
   * Steve had 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days.
   * Amount spent per day = 38 dollars Ã· 8 days = $4.75 per day

2. Calculate how much money Steve had after receiving the extra 11 dollars:
   * Steve received an extra 11 dollars after spending his initial 38 dollars.
   * Steve's total money = $11

3. Calculate how much money John spent:
   * John spent the same amount of money as Steve had initially (38 dollars).
   * John's remaining money = 18 dollars - 38 dollars = -$20

4. Calculate John's final amount of money:
   * John found 25 dollars on the street after spending the money.
   * John's final money = -$20 + $25 = $5

1. You have $45 in your wallet.
2. You find a coin worth $27/30. This means the coin is worth 27 divided by 30 dollars.
   
   27 Ã· 30 = 0.9
   
   So, the coin is worth $0.90.

3. To find the total amount of money you have, add the money in your wallet to the value of the coin you found.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Initially, Sally travels 47/50 of a mile
* Then, she rides another 31 miles
* She completes the same distance every day for the next 28 days
* One day, she adds an extra 32/24 miles to her regular route

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate Sally's regular daily distance:
   * Regular daily distance = 47/50 + 31
   * Regular daily distance = 0.94 + 31 = 31.94 miles

2. Calculate the total distance she traveled in 28 days:
   * Total distance in 28 days = Regular daily distance Ã— 28
   * Total distance in 28 days = 31.94 Ã— 28 = 894.32 miles

3. Convert the extra distance from 32/24 to a decimal:
   * Extra distance = 32/24 = 1.33 miles

4. Calculate the total distance including the extra distance:
   * Total distance = Total distance in 28 days + Extra distance
   * Total distance = 894.32 + 1.33 = 895.65 miles

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Find the total distance the truck can travel with the additional 11 kilometers:
   * The truck can travel 34/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel.
   * Additional distance = 11 kilometers
   * Total distance = 34/25 + 11
   * Total distance = 34/25 + 275/25 (converting 11 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 25)
   * Total distance = 309/25 kilometers

2. Now, let's add another 49 kilometers to the journey:
   * Previous total distance = 309/25 kilometers
   * Additional distance = 49 kilometers
   * New total distance = 309/25 + 49
   * New total distance = 309/25 + 1225/25 (converting 49 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 25)
   * New total distance = 1534/25 kilometers

Therefore, with an additional 11 kilometers, the truck can travel a total distance of 309/25 kilometers. If another 49 kilometers are added, the total distance becomes 1534/25 kilometers.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Alright, let's solve this new scenario step by step:

1. Find the total distance the truck can travel with the additional 30 kilometers:
   * The truck can travel 34/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel.
   * Additional distance = 30 kilometers
   * Total distance = 34/25 + 30
   * Total distance = 34/25 + 750/25 (converting 30 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 25)
   * Total distance = 784/25 kilometers

2. Now, let's add another 49 kilometers to the journey:
   * Previous total distance = 784/25 kilometers
   * Additional distance = 49 kilometers
   * New total distance = 784/25 + 49
   * New total distance = 784/25 + 1225/25 (converting 49 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 25)
   * New total distance = 2009/25 kilometers

Therefore, with an additional 30 kilometers, the truck can travel a total distance of 784/25 kilometers. If another 49 kilometers are added, the total distance becomes 2009/25 kilometers.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The energy drink increases John's jogging speed by 50/49 miles per hour.
   * Without the energy drink, John's jogging speed is 4/22 miles per hour.
   * We need to find the distance John would cover if he jogs for 46/30 hours after consuming the energy drink.

2. Calculate John's jogging speed after consuming the energy drink:
   * Speed after energy drink = Speed without energy drink + Speed increase
   * Speed after energy drink = 4/22 + 50/49
   * Speed after energy drink = (4/22) + (50/49)
   * Speed after energy drink = (4 Ã— 49) / (22 Ã— 49) + (50 Ã— 22) / (49 Ã— 22)
   * Speed after energy drink = 196 / 1078 + 1100 / 1078
   * Speed after energy drink = (196 + 1100) / 1078
   * Speed after energy drink = 1296 / 1078
   * Speed after energy drink â‰ˆ 1.20 miles per hour

3. Calculate the distance John would cover in 46/30 hours at the new speed:
   * Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   * Distance = (1296 / 1078) Ã— (46 / 30)
   * Distance = (1296 Ã— 46) / (1078 Ã— 30)
   * Distance = 59616 / 32340
   * Distance â‰ˆ 1.84 miles

Therefore, if John jogs for 46/30 hours after consuming the energy drink, he would cover approximately 1.84 miles.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. The truck driver starts with 9 gallons of gas in his tank.

2. At the first stop, he adds 21/36 gallons of gas.
   To add fractions, we need to convert them to a common denominator.
   21/36 = 7/12 (dividing both numerator and denominator by 3)
   So, after the first stop, he has 9 + 7/12 gallons of gas.

3. At the second stop, he adds 26/42 gallons of gas.
   Again, let's convert this fraction to the common denominator of 12.
   26/42 = 13/21 (dividing both numerator and denominator by 2)
   13/21 = 13/21 Ã— 4/4 = 52/84 = 31/42 (multiplying numerator and denominator by 4 to get denominator of 12)
   So, after the second stop, he has 9 + 7/12 + 31/42 gallons of gas.

4. Now, let's add these fractions:
   9 + 7/12 + 31/42 = 9 + 7/12 + 31/42
                    = 9 + 7/12 + 31/42 Ã— 7/7
                    = 9 + 7/12 + 217/294
                    = 9 + 91/12
                    = 108/12 + 91/12
                    = 199/12
                    = 16 7/12 gallons (or 16.583 gallons as a decimal)

2. Convert the fraction 47/8 to a decimal or mixed number:
   * 47 Ã· 8 = 5.875
   * 47/8 is equal to 5 7/8 or 5.875 dollars

3. Add the initial amount and the earned amount:
   * Total money = Initial amount + Earned amount
   * Total money = 6 + 5.875
   * Total money = 11.875 dollars

Therefore, after earning money from mowing his neighbor's lawn, John now has a total of 11.875 dollars.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* A barrel of oil costs $16
* The refinery buys 9 barrels

To find the total cost of 9 barrels of oil, we need to multiply the cost of one barrel by the number of barrels purchased.

Total cost = Cost per barrel Ã— Number of barrels
Total cost = $16 Ã— 9
Total cost = $144

Therefore, 9 barrels of oil cost $144 in total.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the new cost per barrel.

Given:
* The new cost of a barrel of oil is $30
* The refinery still buys 9 barrels

To calculate the new total cost for 9 barrels of oil, we multiply the new cost per barrel by the number of barrels purchased.

New total cost = New cost per barrel Ã— Number of barrels
New total cost = $30 Ã— 9
New total cost = $270

Therefore, with the increased price of $30 per barrel, it would now cost the refinery $270 to buy the same 9 barrels of oil.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Amy's current garden is 11 feet long.
   * She plans to expand it by 30 feet.
   * After that, she will further extend the garden by 30 divided by 13 feet.

2. Calculate the length of the garden after the first expansion:
   * Length after first expansion = Current length + 30 feet
   * Length after first expansion = 11 feet + 30 feet
   * Length after first expansion = 41 feet

3. Calculate the additional length for the second expansion:
   * Additional length = 30 Ã· 13 feet
   * Additional length = 2.307692307692308 feet (rounded)

4. Calculate the total length of the garden after all expansions:
   * Total length = Length after first expansion + Additional length
   * Total length = 41 feet + 2.307692307692308 feet
   * Total length = 43.307692307692308 feet

To simplify the final answer, we can round it to two decimal places:

1. First, we need to find the distance between John's house and his work.
   * John's house is (17 / 3) miles from his work.
   * (17 / 3) = 5.666... miles

2. Now, we know that the supermarket is (25 / 41) miles closer to his work than his house.
   * We need to subtract this distance from the distance between John's house and his work.
   * (25 / 41) = 0.609... miles

3. So, the distance of the supermarket from John's work is:
   * Distance = (17 / 3) - (25 / 41)
   * Distance = 5.666... - 0.609...

$19/11 â‰ˆ $1.73 (rounded to the nearest cent)

Step 2: Add the uncommon payment to the bank's current one-dollar bill amount.
Current amount + Uncommon payment = $40 + $1.73 = $41.73

Step 3: Since the bank only deals with one-dollar bills, round down the total to the nearest whole dollar.

1. Find the amount of money John still needs to save:
   * The game costs $40, and John already has $29.
   * Remaining amount = $40 - $29 = $11

2. Calculate the amount of money John saves each week:
   * John saves 20/48 of the remaining amount each week.
   * Weekly savings = (20/48) Ã— $11 = $4.58 (rounded to the nearest cent)

3. Find the total amount John has saved before investing:
   * Total savings = $29 (already had) + $4.58 (weekly savings)
   * Total savings = $33.58

4. Calculate the amount of money John will have after a year of investment:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Maria initially has 13/3 euros.
   * The candy bar costs 32/15 euros.

2. Convert 13/3 euros to an improper fraction:
   * 13/3 = 39/9 euros

3. Subtract the cost of the candy bar from Maria's initial amount:
   * Remaining money = 39/9 - 32/15 euros
   * To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is 45 (LCM of 9 and 15).
   * 39/9 = (39 Ã— 5)/(9 Ã— 5) = 195/45 euros
   * 32/15 = (32 Ã— 3)/(15 Ã— 3) = 96/45 euros
   * Remaining money = 195/45 - 96/45 = 99/45 euros

4. Simplify the fraction:
   * 99/45 = 11/5 euros

Therefore, Maria has 11/5 euros left after buying the candy bar.

3. Subtract the cost of the candy bar from Maria's initial amount:

   * Remaining money = 180/15 - 32/15 euros
   * Remaining money = 148/15 euros

4. Simplify the fraction:

            A carpenter cuts a piece of lumber into pieces that are each 45/44 meters long. How long would 20 pieces of such lumber be in total?

        <p>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) We know that each piece of lumber is 45/44 meters long.

2) We want to find the total length of 20 such pieces.

3) To find the total length, we need to multiply the length of each piece by the number of pieces:

   Total length = Length of each piece Ã— Number of pieces
                = 45/44 Ã— 20

4) To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator by the whole number and keep the denominator the same:

   45/44 Ã— 20 = (45 Ã— 20) / 44
              = 900 / 44

5) Simplifying this fraction:

   900 / 44 = 20 + 20/44
            = 20 + 5/11
            = 20 5/11

Therefore, 20 pieces of lumber, each 45/44 meters long, would have a total length of 20 5/11 meters.

            Continuing from the previous problem, if the carpenter decided to cut each resulting piece again into 25/34 meter pieces, how long would 20 pieces of this newly cut lumber be in total?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's continue from the previous problem and solve this step by step:

1) From the previous problem, we know that 20 pieces of lumber, each 45/44 meters long, would have a total length of 20 5/11 meters.

2) Now, the carpenter is cutting each of these pieces into smaller pieces, each 25/34 meters long.

3) To find out how many 25/34 meter pieces can be cut from the total length of 20 5/11 meters, we need to divide 20 5/11 by 25/34:

   Number of pieces = Total length / Length of each piece
                    = (20 5/11) / (25/34)

4) To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 25/34 is 34/25. So:

   (20 5/11) / (25/34) = (20 5/11) Ã— (34/25)

5) First, let's convert 20 5/11 to an improper fraction:

   20 5/11 = (20 Ã— 11 + 5) / 11 = 225 / 11

6) Now, let's multiply:

   (225 / 11) Ã— (34 / 25) = (225 Ã— 34) / (11 Ã— 25)
                          = 7650 / 275
                          = 27 + 175/275
                          = 27 + 7/11
                          = 27 7/11

7) So, the carpenter can cut 27 7/11 pieces, each 25/34 meters long, from the total length of 20 5/11 meters.

8) The question asks for the total length of 20 pieces of this newly cut lumber. To find this, we multiply the length of each piece by 20:

   Total length of 20 pieces = Length of each piece Ã— 20
                             = 25/34 Ã— 20
                             = (25 Ã— 20) / 34
                             = 500 / 34
                             = 14 + 24/34
                             = 14 12/17

Therefore, 20 pieces of the newly cut lumber, each 25/34 meters long, would have a total length of 14 12/17 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same approach as before, but with the new length of each piece of lumber.

Given:
- Each piece of lumber is 45/31 meters long.
- We want to find the total length of 20 such pieces.

Step 1: Calculate the total length by multiplying the length of each piece by the number of pieces.
Total length = Length of each piece Ã— Number of pieces
             = 45/31 Ã— 20

Step 2: Multiply the fraction by the whole number by multiplying the numerator by the whole number and keeping the denominator the same.
45/31 Ã— 20 = (45 Ã— 20) / 31
           = 900 / 31

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
GCF of 900 and 31 is 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Step 4: Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number.
900 / 31 = 29 + 1/31
         = 29 1/31

Therefore, if the carpenter cuts each piece of lumber into pieces that are 45/31 meters long, 20 pieces of such lumber would have a total length of 29 1/31 meters.

- She cycled an additional 15 miles.

Step 1: Convert the cycling distance to the same fraction denomination as the running distance.
Cycling distance = 15 miles = 15 Ã— 32/32 = 480/32 miles

Step 2: Add the running and cycling distances.
Total distance = Running distance + Cycling distance

            Suppose Jenny's running exercise has changed and she ran a shorter distance during her second round. In the first round, she ran for 41/32 miles and then, after resting, she ran for another 3/4 miles in the second round. How many miles in total did she run now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step. We need to add the distances Jenny ran in the first round and after resting.

First round: 41/32 miles
After resting: 3/4 miles

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 32 and 4 is 32.

41/32 = 41/32
3/4 = 3/4 Ã— 8/8 = 24/32

Now we can add the fractions:
41/32 + 24/32 = (41 + 24)/32 = 65/32

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). The GCF of 65 and 32 is 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, with the changed running exercise, Jenny ran a total of 65/32 miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">I apologize, but there seems to be an error in the question. In the United States, there is no such thing as a $33 bill. The denominations of U.S. currency currently in circulation are:

$1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills.

There are also coins: 1Â¢ (penny), 5Â¢ (nickel), 10Â¢ (dime), 25Â¢ (quarter), 50Â¢ (half-dollar), and $1 (dollar coin).

Since a $33 bill does not exist, the question cannot be answered as stated. If the question were revised with a valid denomination, such as John finding a $20 bill, then the problem could be solved as follows:

John's initial amount: $32
Amount found: $20

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many hours Carrie rode her bike in total:
   * She rode for 7 hours, and then another 38/25 of an hour.
   * Total hours = 7 + 38/25
   * To add fractions, we need to convert 7 to an improper fraction with the same denominator as 38/25:
     * 7 = 7 Ã— 25/25 = 175/25
   * Now we can add the fractions:
     * Total hours = 175/25 + 38/25 = 213/25 = &lt;&lt;175/25+38/25=213/25&gt;&gt;8.52 hours

2. Now that we know Carrie rode for 8.52 hours, and she covered 35 kilometers in each hour, let's calculate the total distance:
   * Total kilometers = 8.52 Ã— 35
   * Total kilometers = &lt;&lt;8.52*35=298.2&gt;&gt;298.2 kilometers

Therefore, Carrie covered a total of 298.2 kilometers.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Joe distributed 40 pamphlets each day for 19 days.
   * He made a mistake and had to destroy 5 of the pamphlets initially considered distributed.

2. Calculate the total number of pamphlets distributed before the error:
   * Total pamphlets before error = Number of pamphlets per day Ã— Number of days
   * Total pamphlets before error = 40 Ã— 19
   * Total pamphlets before error = 760

3. Subtract the number of destroyed pamphlets from the total:
   * Actual pamphlets distributed = Total pamphlets before error - Destroyed pamphlets
   * Actual pamphlets distributed = 760 - 5
   * Actual pamphlets distributed = 755

Therefore, after accounting for the error, Joe has actually distributed 755 pamphlets.

Given:
- Jane cycled a total of 496 kilometers from her starting point.
- The object is 30 km back from her current location.

Step 1: Determine the distance between Jane's current location and the object.
Distance from current location to object = 30 km

Step 2: Calculate the distance of the object from Jane's starting point.
Distance of object from starting point = Total distance cycled - Distance from current location to object
Distance of object from starting point = 496 km - 30 km = 466 km

1. Jack initially had 38 dollars.

2. He earned 41/48 of a dollar from recycling cans.
   To convert 41/48 to a decimal, divide 41 by 48:

1. First, let's calculate the distance Jenny traveled in 29 hours at a speed of 32/24 miles per hour.
   * Speed = 32/24 miles per hour = 4/3 miles per hour
   * Time = 29 hours
   * Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   * Distance = 4/3 Ã— 29 = 116/3 miles = &lt;&lt;116/3=38.666666666666664&gt;&gt;38 2/3 miles

2. Now, let's find out how far she could travel if her speed increased by a factor of 43/15.
   * New speed = Original speed Ã— 43/15
   * New speed = 4/3 Ã— 43/15 = 172/45 miles per hour

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off and calculate the total distance traveled by Jenny.

Given:
- Jenny traveled 110 38/45 miles at her increased speed for 29 hours.
- She then continued to travel at her original speed of 32/24 miles per hour for another 29 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled at the original speed for the additional 29 hours.
- Original speed = 32/24 miles per hour = 4/3 miles per hour
- Time = 29 hours
- Distance = Speed Ã— Time
- Distance = 4/3 Ã— 29 = 116/3 miles = 38 2/3 miles

Step 2: Add the distances traveled at the increased speed and the original speed.
- Total distance = Distance at increased speed + Distance at original speed
- Total distance = 110 38/45 + 38 2/3
- To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is 45 Ã— 3 = 135.

- 110 38/45 = (110 Ã— 3 + 38) / (45 Ã— 3) = 368/135
- 38 2/3 = (38 Ã— 45 + 2 Ã— 15) / (3 Ã— 45) = 1740/135

- Total distance = 368/135 + 1740/135 = 2108/135 = &lt;&lt;2108/135=15.614814814814814&gt;&gt;15 73/135 miles

1. We know that in her previous trip, Jenny drove for 29 hours at a speed of 32/24 miles per hour.
   * Speed = 32/24 miles per hour = 4/3 miles per hour
   * Time = 29 hours
   * Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   * Distance = 4/3 Ã— 29 = 116/3 miles = 38 2/3 miles

2. Now, let's find out how far she could travel if her speed increased by a factor of 43/32.
   * New speed = Original speed Ã— 43/32
   * New speed = 4/3 Ã— 43/32 = 172/96 miles per hour = &lt;&lt;172/96=1.7916666666666667&gt;&gt;1 43/48 miles per hour

3. To find the new distance, we use the new speed and the same time:
   * New distance = New speed Ã— Time
   * New distance = 1 43/48 Ã— 29 = 4343/48 miles = &lt;&lt;4343/48=90.47916666666667&gt;&gt;90 23/48 miles

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same steps as before, but with the updated number of students.

Given:
- Each student received 16/31 litres of paint.
- There were 40 students in the class.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of paint distributed by multiplying the amount of paint each student received by the number of students.
Total paint = Paint per student Ã— Number of students
Total paint = 16/31 Ã— 40

Step 2: Multiply the fractions.
16/31 Ã— 40/1 = (16 Ã— 40) / (31 Ã— 1) = 640 / 31

Step 3: Simplify the fraction if possible.
640 / 31 cannot be simplified further as there are no common factors between 640 and 31.

Therefore, the total amount of paint distributed to all 40 students initially would be 640/31 litres.

            Tom moved two rocks today. The first rock was moved for an interval of 20/50 hours, and the second was moved for an interval of 45/36 hours. If Tom can move rocks at a speed of 25/22 miles per hour, how far in miles did he move the rocks today?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, let's find the total time Tom spent moving rocks:
   * Time for the first rock = 20/50 hours = &lt;&lt;20/50=2/5&gt;&gt;2/5 hours
   * Time for the second rock = 45/36 hours = &lt;&lt;45/36=5/4&gt;&gt;5/4 hours
   * Total time = 2/5 + 5/4 = &lt;&lt;2/5+5/4=(8+25)/20=33/20&gt;&gt;33/20 hours

2. Now, we know that Tom moves rocks at a speed of 25/22 miles per hour. To find the total distance, we multiply the speed by the total time:
   * Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   * Distance = 25/22 Ã— 33/20 miles
   * Distance = &lt;&lt;25/22*33/20=(25*33)/(22*20)=825/440&gt;&gt;825/440 miles

3. Simplifying the fraction:
   * 825/440 = &lt;&lt;825/440=1+(385/440)=1 7/8&gt;&gt;1 7/8 miles

Therefore, Tom moved the rocks a total distance of 1 7/8 miles today.

   * Time for the first rock = 20/50 hours = &lt;&lt;20/50=2/5&gt;&gt;2/5 hours
   * Time for the second rock = 45/9 hours = &lt;&lt;45/9=5&gt;&gt;5 hours
   * Total time = 2/5 + 5 = &lt;&lt;2/5+5=27/5&gt;&gt;27/5 hours

2. Now, we know that Tom moves rocks at a speed of 25/22 miles per hour. To find the total distance, we multiply the speed by the total time:
   * Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   * Distance = 25/22 Ã— 27/5 miles
   * Distance = &lt;&lt;25/22*27/5=(25*27)/(22*5)=675/110&gt;&gt;675/110 miles

3. Simplifying the fraction:
   * 675/110 = &lt;&lt;675/110=6+(25/110)=6 5/22&gt;&gt;6 5/22 miles

Therefore, with the updated time for moving the second rock, Tom moved the rocks a total distance of 6 5/22 miles.

   * 50/41 = (50 Ã— 35) / 1435 = 1750/1435
   * Total juice = 943/1435 + 1750/1435 = 2693/1435 gallons

2. The juice is transferred into a 28-gallon bottle, and a customer drinks 11/19 gallon:
   * Remaining juice in the bottle = 2693/1435 - 11/19 gallons
   * Again, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 1435 Ã— 19 = 27265.
   * 2693/1435 = (2693 Ã— 19) / 27265 = 51167/27265 gallons
   * 11/19 = (11 Ã— 1435) / 27265 = 15785/27265 gallons
   * Remaining juice in the bottle = 51167/27265 - 15785/27265 = 35382/27265 gallons

3. Convert the remaining juice to a mixed number:
   * 35382 Ã· 27265 = 1 with a remainder of 8117
   * The remaining juice is 1 8117/27265 gallons

4. Calculate the space left in the bottle:
   * Space left = Bottle capacity - Remaining juice
   * Space left = 28 - 1 8117/27265 gallons
   * Space left = 26 19148/27265 gallons

Given:
- The car can actually travel 50 miles on 1 gallon of gas (instead of the previously calculated 36 miles per gallon).
- The car has a 19-gallon tank.

To find the total distance the car can travel on a full tank with the new mileage measurement, we need to multiply the updated miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank.

Step 1: Set up the multiplication.
Distance = Miles per gallon Ã— Number of gallons
Distance = 50 Ã— 19

Step 2: Multiply.
Distance = 50 Ã— 19 = 950

Therefore, with the updated mileage measurement of 50 miles per gallon, the car can travel a total distance of 950 miles on a full tank of 19 gallons.

1. Hannah initially thought she had 5 piggy banks with 34 coins each.
2. After recounting, she found that she actually has 5 piggy banks with 27 coins each.
3. To find the total number of coins after correcting her count, we need to multiply the number of piggy banks by the actual number of coins in each piggy bank.

Total coins after recounting = Number of piggy banks Ã— Actual coins in each piggy bank
Total coins after recounting = 5 Ã— 27 = &lt;&lt;5*27=135&gt;&gt;135

Therefore, after correcting her count, Hannah has a total of 135 coins in her 5 piggy banks.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total volume of liquid Richard consumed, we need to add the amount of wine, orange juice, and water he drank. Let's convert all the measurements to liters for consistency.

1. Wine:
   * The bottle had 33 ounces of wine, and Richard drank 33/48 of it.
   * 33 ounces â‰ˆ 0.975 liters (1 ounce â‰ˆ 0.0296 liters)
   * Amount of wine consumed = 33/48 Ã— 0.975 liters â‰ˆ 0.669 liters

2. Orange juice:
   * Richard drank 26/30 of a liter of orange juice.
   * Amount of orange juice consumed = 26/30 liters â‰ˆ 0.867 liters

3. Water:
   * Richard drank 2/36 of a liter of water.
   * Amount of water consumed = 2/36 liters â‰ˆ 0.056 liters

4. Total volume of liquid consumed:
   * Total = Wine + Orange juice + Water

Total amount = Current amount + Additional amount
Total amount = $19 + $10 = $29

Therefore, after Jaden's mother gives him $10, the total amount in his savings account will be $29.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption, we need to calculate how many pounds of apples and ounces of apple juice he consumes per day.

1. Apples:
   * John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days.
   * Daily apple consumption = 17 pounds Ã· 8 days = 2.125 pounds/day

2. Apple juice:
   * John consumes 48 ounces of apple juice every 42 days.
   * Daily apple juice consumption = 48 ounces Ã· 42 days â‰ˆ 1.143 ounces/day

3. Rate of apple to apple juice consumption:
   * Convert the apple juice consumption to pounds per day:
     - 1 pound = 16 ounces
     - 1.143 ounces/day Ã· 16 ounces/pound â‰ˆ 0.071 pounds/day
   * Rate = Daily apple consumption Ã· Daily apple juice consumption (in pounds)
   * Rate = 2.125 pounds/day Ã· 0.071 pounds/day â‰ˆ 29.93

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. The well is initially 45 miles away from the village.

2. In one hour, the donkey can carry water back from the well, effectively reducing the distance by 18/33 miles.

3. To find the effective distance after 1 hour, we need to subtract the distance the donkey reduced from the initial distance:
   * Effective distance = Initial distance - Distance reduced by the donkey
   * Effective distance = 45 - 18/33 miles

4. To subtract fractions, we need to convert the whole number (45) into a fraction with the same denominator as 18/33:
   * 45 = 45 Ã— 33/33 = 1485/33

5. Now we can subtract:
   * Effective distance = 1485/33 - 18/33
   * Effective distance = (1485 - 18)/33
   * Effective distance = 1467/33 miles

6. To simplify the fraction, divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF):
   * GCF of 1467 and 33 is 3
   * Effective distance = (1467 Ã· 3)/(33 Ã· 3)
   * Effective distance = 489/11 miles

Therefore, after 1 hour, the effective distance of the well from the village is 489/11 miles.

Given:
- The effective distance of each well from its respective village after 1 hour is 45 - (18/33) miles.
- The resident wants to retrieve water from both wells.

Step 1: Calculate the effective distance of each well from its village after 1 hour.
From the previous question, we know that the effective distance is 489/11 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the total effective distance the resident would have to travel to retrieve water from both wells.
Total effective distance = Effective distance to Well 1 + Effective distance to Well 2
Total effective distance = 489/11 + 489/11
Total effective distance = 2 Ã— (489/11)
Total effective distance = 978/11 miles

Step 3: Simplify the fraction (if possible).
The fraction 978/11 cannot be simplified further as the GCF of 978 and 11 is 1.

Therefore, the total effective distance the resident would have to travel to retrieve water from both wells is 978/11 miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Alright, let's solve this problem with the new information:

1. The well is initially 45 miles away from the village.

2. In one hour, the donkey can carry water back from the well, effectively reducing the distance by 16/33 miles.

3. To find the effective distance after 1 hour, we need to subtract the distance the donkey reduced from the initial distance:
   * Effective distance = Initial distance - Distance reduced by the donkey
   * Effective distance = 45 - 16/33 miles

4. To subtract fractions, we need to convert the whole number (45) into a fraction with the same denominator as 16/33:
   * 45 = 45 Ã— 33/33 = 1485/33

5. Now we can subtract:
   * Effective distance = 1485/33 - 16/33
   * Effective distance = (1485 - 16)/33
   * Effective distance = 1469/33 miles

6. To simplify the fraction, divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF):
   * GCF of 1469 and 33 is 1 (the fraction is already in its simplest form)
   * Effective distance = 1469/33 miles

Therefore, after 1 hour, with the donkey reducing the distance by 16/33 miles, the new effective distance of the well from the village would be 1469/33 miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Clara's initial money: $30

2. Money spent on ice cream: $25/6
   To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. So, 25/6 = 25 Ã· 6/1 = 25 Ã— 1/6 = 125/6
   Money spent on ice cream: $125/6 â‰ˆ $20.83

3. Remaining money after buying ice cream: $30 - $125/6 = $180/6 - $125/6 = $55/6 â‰ˆ $9.17

4. Money spent on the book: 11/21 of the remaining money
   11/21 Ã— $55/6 = (11 Ã— 55) Ã· (21 Ã— 6) = 605 Ã· 126 â‰ˆ $4.80

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Jessie initially has $34 in savings
* Her grandma gives her $20
* She saves for 13 weeks
* Each week, she saves an amount equal to her initial savings plus the money from her grandma

First, let's calculate the amount Jessie saves each week:
$34 (initial savings) + $20 (money from grandma) = $54 (saved each week)

Now, to find the total amount saved after 13 weeks, we multiply the weekly savings by the number of weeks:

$54 (saved each week) Ã— 13 (weeks) = $702

Therefore, Jessie saves a total of $702 after 13 weeks.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Calculate the discount amount:
   * Discount = 43/27 dollars
   * Discount = &lt;&lt;43/27=1.5925925925925926&gt;&gt;1.59 dollars (rounded to two decimal places)

2. Calculate the actual amount spent on groceries after the discount:
   * Amount spent on groceries = 43 - 1.59
   * Amount spent on groceries = &lt;&lt;43-1.59=41.41&gt;&gt;41.41 dollars

3. Calculate the cost of the book:
   * Cost of the book = 13/36 dollars
   * Cost of the book = &lt;&lt;13/36=0.3611111111111111&gt;&gt;0.36 dollars (rounded to two decimal places)

4. Calculate the total amount spent:
   * Total amount = Amount spent on groceries + Cost of the book

1. Initially, you have 27/6 gallons of water in the tank.
   27/6 = 4.5 gallons

2. You pour out 5/40 gallons of water from the tank.
   5/40 = 0.125 gallons
   Remaining water = 4.5 - 0.125 = 4.375 gallons

3. You add 21/26 gallons more to the tank.
   21/26 = 0.8076923076923077 gallons (rounded)
   Total water in the tank = 4.375 + 0.8076923076923077 = 5.182692307692308 gallons

To simplify the fraction:
5.182692307692308 = 5 + 0.182692307692308
0.182692307692308 * 26 = 4.75

            Your favorite juice shop buys oranges for $34 per 8 bags. They've found a new vendor offering the same quantity of oranges for $19 per 30 bags. How much less per bag does the new vendor charge?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much less per bag the new vendor charges, we need to calculate the price per bag for both the current supplier and the new vendor.

Current supplier:
- Price: $34 for 8 bags
- Price per bag: $34 Ã· 8 = $4.25 per bag

New vendor:
- Price: $19 for 30 bags
- Price per bag: $19 Ã· 30 = $0.63333... per bag, which rounds to $0.63 per bag

To find the difference in price per bag, we subtract:
$4.25 - $0.63 = $3.62

Therefore, the new vendor charges $3.62 less per bag than the current supplier.

Given:
- Lisa spends $50 over 46 days.

Step 1: Divide the total amount by the number of days.
Amount per day = Total amount Ã· Number of days
Amount per day = $50 Ã· 46
Amount per day = $1.0869565217391304

To make the answer more practical, we can round the amount to the nearest cent.

Step 2: Round the amount per day to the nearest cent.

3. Multiply the fractions:
   * (22/43) Ã— (1/4) = (22 Ã— 1) / (43 Ã— 4)
   * (22/43) Ã— (1/4) = 22 / 172

1. Understand the given information:
   * The sports car's initial speed is 40 miles per hour.

3. Calculate the additional speed gained after one hour:
   * Additional speed = 26/24 miles per hour = 1.08 miles per hour

4. Add the initial speed and the additional speed to find the total speed after one hour:
   * Total speed = Initial speed + Additional speed
   * Total speed = 40 miles per hour + 1.08 miles per hour

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the two fractions of milk together.

Given:
- James initially bought 33/37 gallons of milk.
- He later added 3/25 gallons of milk to the jug.

Step 1: Find a common denominator for the fractions.
The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 37 and 25.
LCM(37, 25) = 925

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
33/37 = (33 Ã— 25) / (37 Ã— 25) = 825/925
3/25 = (3 Ã— 37) / (25 Ã— 37) = 111/925

Step 3: Add the fractions.
825/925 + 111/925 = 936/925

Step 4: Simplify the fraction (if possible).
936/925 cannot be simplified further.

Given:
- James has 30 similar jugs of milk.
- Each jug contains 936/925 gallons of milk.

Step 1: Multiply the amount of milk in one jug by the number of jugs.
Total milk = 936/925 Ã— 30
Total milk = (936 Ã— 30) / 925
Total milk = 28080 / 925

Step 1: Find a common denominator for the fractions.
The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 37 and 25.

1. Convert the fractions to decimals for easier calculation:

            A turtle travels at a speed of 19/6 feet per second. How far, in feet, would the turtle travel in 24 seconds if it starts 20 feet ahead from the starting point?
        </p>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1) First, let's calculate how far the turtle travels in 24 seconds at its speed of 19/6 feet per second.

   Distance = Speed Ã— Time
            = (19/6) feet/second Ã— 24 seconds
            = (19 Ã— 24) / 6 feet
            = 456 / 6 feet
            = 76 feet

2) Now, we need to add the 20 feet that the turtle starts ahead from the starting point.

   Total distance = Distance traveled in 24 seconds + Starting distance
                  = 76 feet + 20 feet
                  = 96 feet

### Answer: 96 feet.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In our earlier calculation, we were considering the distance the turtle travelled in 24 seconds. What happens if we reconsider, and instead calculate the turtle's distance covered in 33 seconds from the same starting point that was 20 feet ahead? How many feet would the turtle travel in total then?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's apply the same process but with the new time of 33 seconds:

1) Calculate the distance the turtle travels in 33 seconds at its speed of 19/6 feet per second.

   Distance = Speed Ã— Time
            = (19/6) feet/second Ã— 33 seconds
            = (19 Ã— 33) / 6 feet
            = 627 / 6 feet
            = 104.5 feet

2) Add the 20 feet that the turtle starts ahead from the starting point.

   Total distance = Distance traveled in 33 seconds + Starting distance
                  = 104.5 feet + 20 feet
                  = 124.5 feet

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The container's capacity is 3 liters.
   * Carlos filled the container with orange juice to 41/49 of its capacity.

2. Calculate the amount of orange juice Carlos poured into the container:
   * Amount of orange juice = Capacity of the container Ã— Fraction of the capacity filled
   * Amount of orange juice = 3 liters Ã— 41/49
   * Amount of orange juice = (3 Ã— 41) Ã· 49
   * Amount of orange juice = 123 Ã· 49
   * Amount of orange juice = 2.51 liters

Therefore, Carlos poured 2.51 liters of orange juice into the container.
