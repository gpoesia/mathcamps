        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* Harvey has a total of 70 roller skates in his shop.
* 42 of those roller skates are for children.

To find out how many roller skates Harvey has for adults, we need to subtract the number of children's roller skates from the total number of roller skates.

Adult roller skates = Total roller skates - Children's roller skates
Adult roller skates = 70 - 42 = &lt;&lt;70-42=28&gt;&gt;28

Therefore, Harvey has 28 roller skates for adults in his shop.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The town initially had 98 dogs.
* After some dogs relocated, the town was left with 73 dogs.

To find out how many dogs relocated, we need to subtract the number of dogs remaining from the initial number of dogs.

Relocated dogs = Initial number of dogs - Remaining dogs
Relocated dogs = 98 - 73 = 25

Therefore, 25 dogs relocated from the town.

* The pirate ship with crew and cargo weighs 78 tons.
* The cargo weighs 74 tons.
* We need to find the weight of the ship with just the crew.

To find the weight of the ship with just the crew, we need to subtract the weight of the cargo from the total weight of the ship with crew and cargo.

Weight of ship with crew = Total weight - Weight of cargo
Weight of ship with crew = 78 tons - 74 tons
Weight of ship with crew = &lt;&lt;78-74=4&gt;&gt;4 tons

Therefore, the weight of Captain Bruce's pirate ship with just the crew is 4 tons.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Initially, Sam had 22 strings.
   * After adding some more strings, he now has a total of 41 strings.

2. To find the number of extra strings Sam added, we need to subtract the initial number of strings from the total number of strings:
   * Extra strings = Total strings - Initial strings
   * Extra strings = 41 - 22
   * Extra strings = &lt;&lt;41-22=19&gt;&gt;19

Therefore, Sam added 19 extra strings to his collection.

* 34 of these crop circles have already been found.

To find out how many crop circles are yet to be discovered, we need to subtract the number of crop circles found from the total number of crop circles.

Crop circles yet to discover = Total crop circles - Crop circles found
Crop circles yet to discover = 82 - 34 = &lt;&lt;82-34=48&gt;&gt;48

* He takes an additional amount of time 'b' to finish the puzzle completely.
* Altogether, he spends 13 hours working on the puzzle.

To find the additional hours 'b' that John spends to finish the puzzle, we can set up an equation:
* Initial time + Additional time = Total time
* 7 + b = 13

Now, let's solve the equation for 'b':

2. To find how many stuffed animals Emily gave to her friend, we need to subtract the number of stuffed animals she has now from the number she had initially.
   * Number of stuffed animals given = Initial number - Current number
   * Number of stuffed animals given = 98 - 95
   * Number of stuffed animals given = 3

Therefore, Emily gave 3 stuffed animals to her friend.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Initially, there were 83 trees in the forest.
* After the storm, the number of trees reduced to 12.

To find out how many trees were uprooted by the storm, we need to subtract the number of trees remaining after the storm from the initial number of trees.

Trees uprooted = Initial number of trees - Trees remaining after the storm
Trees uprooted = 83 - 12 = &lt;&lt;83-12=71&gt;&gt;71

Therefore, 71 trees were uprooted by the storm.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The weather forecast predicted 52 mm of rainfall.
   * The actual rainfall was 15 mm less than predicted.

2. To find the actual rainfall, we need to subtract the difference from the predicted rainfall:
   * Actual rainfall = Predicted rainfall - Difference
   * Actual rainfall = 52 mm - 15 mm
   * Actual rainfall = 37 mm

Therefore, the actual amount of rain that fell was 37 mm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* The doctor currently has 47 medical books.
* She wants to have 33 more books in her collection.

To find out how many more books the doctor needs, we can:
1. Find the desired total number of books in the collection.
2. Subtract the current number of books from the desired total.

Step 1: Find the desired total number of books
* Desired total = Current number of books + Additional books wanted
* Desired total = 47 + 33 = 80

Step 2: Subtract the current number of books from the desired total
* Additional books needed = Desired total - Current number of books
* Additional books needed = 80 - 47 = 33

Therefore, the doctor needs to acquire 33 more medical books to achieve her desired collection size.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John initially travels 42 miles on his scooter.
   * He continues to travel until he has covered a total of 89 miles.

2. To find the additional miles John travels, we need to subtract the initial distance from the total distance:
   * Additional miles = Total miles - Initial miles
   * Additional miles = 89 miles - 42 miles
   * Additional miles = 47 miles

Therefore, John travels an additional 47 miles after his initial 42-mile journey.

1. Let's define our variables:
   - Let 'g' be the initial amount of water in the tank.

2. We know that 3 gallons were removed from the tank, and the remaining amount was 40 gallons. We can represent this as an equation:
   - Initial amount - 3 gallons = 40 gallons
   - In terms of our variable: g - 3 = 40

3. To find the initial amount, we need to solve the equation for 'g':

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jason has some building blocks in his cabinet.
   * If he takes out 47 blocks, he will have 41 blocks left.

2. Let's represent the initial number of blocks as a variable:
   * Let the initial number of blocks be x.

3. Set up an equation based on the given information:
   * Initial blocks - Blocks taken out = Blocks left
   * x - 47 = 41

4. Solve the equation to find the initial number of blocks:
   * x - 47 = 41
   * x = 41 + 47
   * x = 88

Therefore, Jason had 88 building blocks in his cabinet initially.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The pirate found a treasure chest with 58 gold coins.
* He gave 44 of those coins to his parrot.

To find out how many gold coins the pirate has left, we need to subtract the number of coins he gave to his parrot from the total number of coins he found.

58 (total coins) - 44 (coins given to the parrot) = 58 - 44 = 14

Therefore, the pirate has 14 gold coins left.

2. Let's represent the original number of beds as a variable, say 'x'.

3. After removing 8 beds, the remaining beds are 72. We can represent this as an equation:
   * x - 8 = 72

4. To find the original number of beds, we need to solve the equation for 'x'.

- The snail traveled 57 cm in a day.
- The snail ended its journey at a point 24 cm from the starting point.

To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the distance traveled in a day to the distance between the starting and ending points.

Total distance = Distance traveled in a day + Distance between starting and ending points
Total distance = 57 cm + 24 cm

   * She used 60 individual stickers to reward her students.
   * After using the stickers, she now has 2 sheets left.

2. Find the number of stickers in each sheet:
   * We know that after using 60 stickers, the teacher has 2 sheets left.
   * So, the number of stickers in each sheet must be 60/2 = 30.

3. Set up an equation to find the initial number of sheets:
   * Let 'a' be the initial number of sheets.
   * Each sheet has 30 stickers.
   * After using 60 stickers, the teacher has 2 sheets left.
   * So, the equation is: a Ã— 30 - 60 = 2 Ã— 30

4. Solve the equation:
   * a Ã— 30 - 60 = 2 Ã— 30
   * a Ã— 30 - 60 = 60

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The teacher starts with 67 pencils.
   * After some pencils are lost, she only has 10 left.

2. To find the number of pencils the teacher lost, we need to subtract the number of pencils left from the initial number of pencils:
   * Number of pencils lost = Initial number of pencils - Number of pencils left
   * Number of pencils lost = 67 - 10
   * Number of pencils lost = 57

Therefore, the teacher lost 57 pencils.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's approach this step by step:

1) We know that the backpack originally had some items inside. Let's call this initial number of items x.

2) Later, 69 items were added to the backpack.

3) After adding these items, the total number of items in the backpack is 72.

4) We can represent this situation with an equation:

   Initial items (x) + Added items (69) = Total items (72)
   
   x + 69 = 72

5) To find the initial number of items, we need to solve this equation for x:

   x = 72 - 69
   x = 3

Therefore, the backpack initially had 3 items.

1. Let's define a variable for the unknown number of cows the farmer started with. Let's call it x.

2. We know that after selling 39 cows, the farmer is left with 55 cows. We can represent this with an equation:
   * x - 39 = 55

3. To find the initial number of cows (x), we need to solve this equation. We can do this by adding 39 to both sides:

* The zoo started with an unknown number of animals, which we'll call s.
* 24 animals were moved to a separate area for cleaning and care.
* After moving these animals, there were 75 animals left in the main section of the zoo.

To find the total number of animals at the start of the day, we need to add the number of animals moved for cleaning and care to the number of animals left in the main section.

In other words:
* Total animals at the start (s) = Animals moved for cleaning (24) + Animals left in the main section (75)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Initially, the astronaut found a planet with 69 moons.
* After further exploration, the total number of moons increased to 91.

To find out how many more moons the astronaut discovered, we need to subtract the initial number of moons from the total number of moons:

Additional moons = Total moons - Initial moons
Additional moons = 91 - 69 = &lt;&lt;91-69=22&gt;&gt;22

Therefore, the astronaut discovered 22 more moons.

* In the morning, the wind turbine produced 56 units of energy.
* By evening, the total energy production reached 92 units.

To find out how much energy the wind turbine produced from the morning to the evening, we need to subtract the morning energy production from the total energy production by evening.

Energy produced from morning to evening = Total energy production by evening - Morning energy production
Energy produced from morning to evening = 92 - 56 = 36

Therefore, the wind turbine produced 36 units of energy from the morning to the evening.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* Molly starts with 81 milliliters of toothpaste in a new tube.
* She has used 78 milliliters of toothpaste.

To find out how much toothpaste is left in the tube, we need to subtract the amount used from the initial amount:

Toothpaste left = Initial amount - Amount used
Toothpaste left = 81 milliliters - 78 milliliters
Toothpaste left = &lt;&lt;81-78=3&gt;&gt;3 milliliters

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Initially, there were 73 sharks in the ocean.
   * After some time, more sharks joined, and the total number became 94.

2. To find the number of sharks that joined later, we need to subtract the initial number of sharks from the total number of sharks after the new sharks joined.

3. Number of sharks that joined later = Total number of sharks after joining - Initial number of sharks
   * Number of sharks that joined later = 94 - 73
   * Number of sharks that joined later = 21

Therefore, 21 sharks joined later.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 93 shapes in total in the box.
2. Out of these 93 shapes, 79 are triangles.
3. To find the number of shapes that are not triangles, we need to subtract the number of triangles from the total number of shapes.

Number of non-triangle shapes = Total shapes - Number of triangles
Number of non-triangle shapes = 93 - 79 = &lt;&lt;93-79=14&gt;&gt;14

Therefore, there are 14 shapes in the box that are not triangles.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Initially, the rink had 44 pairs of roller skates.
   * After purchasing new pairs, the rink now has 71 pairs.

2. To find the number of new pairs purchased, we need to subtract the initial number of pairs from the current number of pairs:
   * New pairs = Current pairs - Initial pairs
   * New pairs = 71 - 44
   * New pairs = 27

Therefore, the rink bought 27 new pairs of roller skates.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The beachcomber initially found 58 starfish.
   * Later, he found more starfish, making his total count 69.

2. To find the number of additional starfish, we need to subtract the initial count from the total count:
   * Additional starfish = Total count - Initial count
   * Additional starfish = 69 - 58
   * Additional starfish = &lt;&lt;69-58=11&gt;&gt;11

Therefore, the beachcomber found 11 additional starfish later in the day.
