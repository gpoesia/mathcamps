        A chocolate factory initially had 33 chocolate bars. However, 6 of them were given away as samples to customers. Then, 3 of them were used for a quality control testing. How many chocolate bars are left in the factory?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. The factory initially had 33 chocolate bars.

2. 6 chocolate bars were given away as samples to customers.
   * Remaining chocolate bars after giving away samples = 33 - 6 = 27

3. 3 chocolate bars were used for quality control testing.
   * Remaining chocolate bars after quality control testing = 27 - 3 = 24

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars left in the factory is 24.

        After performing inventory, the chocolate factory decided to match the number of remaining chocolate bars by producing new ones. How many chocolate bars are there at the factory now, after adding the new bars?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off and solve the new question.

Given:
- The factory had 24 chocolate bars remaining after giving away samples and conducting quality control testing.
- The factory decided to produce new chocolate bars to match the number of remaining bars.

Step 1: Calculate the number of new chocolate bars produced.
New chocolate bars produced = Remaining chocolate bars = 24

Step 2: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars at the factory after adding the new bars.
Total chocolate bars = Remaining chocolate bars + New chocolate bars produced
Total chocolate bars = 24 + 24 = 48

Therefore, after producing new chocolate bars to match the number of remaining bars, the factory now has a total of 48 chocolate bars.

        In a similar scenario, instead of starting with 33 chocolate bars, the factory had only 17 bars initially. After giving away 6 samples and using 3 bars for quality control tests, how many chocolate bars remain in the factory?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same approach as before.

Given:
- The factory initially had 17 chocolate bars.
- 6 chocolate bars were given away as samples to customers.
- 3 chocolate bars were used for quality control testing.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chocolate bars remaining after giving away samples.
Remaining chocolate bars after giving away samples = Initial number of bars - Number of samples given away
Remaining chocolate bars after giving away samples = 17 - 6 = 11

Step 2: Calculate the number of chocolate bars remaining after quality control testing.
Remaining chocolate bars after quality control testing = Remaining bars after giving away samples - Number of bars used for testing
Remaining chocolate bars after quality control testing = 11 - 3 = 8

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars left in the factory is 8.

* John initially had $5 in his wallet.
* He found a birthday card with $86 inside.
* He added the money from the birthday card to his wallet.

To find out how much money John has now, we need to add the initial amount in his wallet to the money he found in the birthday card.

Initial amount in wallet: $5
Money found in birthday card: $86
Total money in wallet now: $5 + $86 = $91

Therefore, after adding the money from the birthday card, John now has $91 in his wallet.

* John had $91 in his wallet after adding the money from the birthday card.
* He bought a video game that costs $78.

To find out how much money John has left in his wallet, we need to subtract the cost of the video game from the total money he had.

Money in wallet before buying the game: $91
Cost of the video game: $78
Money left in wallet: $91 - $78 = $13

So, after paying for the video game, John has $13 left in his wallet.

To find out how much money John has now, we need to add the initial amount in his wallet to the money he found in the birthday card.

Initial amount in wallet: $2
Money found in birthday card: $5
Total money in wallet now: $2 + $5 = $7

Given:
- The sun is 56 million miles away from the planet.
- Every mile corresponds to one unit of brightness for their daylight.

Step 1: Convert the distance from miles to the planet's units of brightness.
Since every mile corresponds to one unit of brightness, the number of units of brightness will be equal to the number of miles.

Units of brightness = 56,000,000

Therefore, the total brightness of daylight on the planet is 56,000,000 units.

To find the total number of monkeys in the jungle now, we need to add the initial number of monkeys to the number of new monkeys.

Initial number of monkeys = 42

Initial number of monkeys = 26
New monkeys = 29
Total monkeys now = Initial number of monkeys + New monkeys
Total monkeys now = 26 + 29 = 55

        Let's say the owner originally had 28 windows on the ground floor and decided to add just 4 more for better aesthetics. However, instead of 51 windows as in the previous scenario, suppose he only had 25 windows on the next floor. Now, how many windows are there in total in the building?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information based on the new scenario:
* Initially, there were 28 windows on the ground floor.
* The owner added 4 more windows to the ground floor.
* On the next floor, there are 25 windows.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Find the total number of windows on the ground floor after adding 4 more:
   * Total windows on the ground floor = Initial windows + Added windows
   * Total windows on the ground floor = 28 + 4 = 32

2. Find the total number of windows in the building:
   * Total windows = Total windows on the ground floor + Windows on the next floor
   * Total windows = 32 + 25 = 57

Therefore, in this new scenario, the total number of windows in the building is 57.

2. Calculate the number of cucumbers remaining after the insects ate some:
   * Remaining cucumbers after insects = 93 - 13 = 80

3. Calculate the number of cucumbers left after the gardener removed some for dinner:
   * Cucumbers left in the garden = 80 - 9 = 71

Given:
- After the insects ate some cucumbers and the gardener removed some for dinner, there were 71 cucumbers left in the garden.
- A group of children came and picked 50 cucumbers for a school project.

To find out how many cucumbers are left in the garden after the children took their cucumbers, we need to subtract the number of cucumbers the children picked from the remaining cucumbers in the garden.

Cucumbers left after children picked = Remaining cucumbers - Cucumbers picked by children
Cucumbers left after children picked = 71 - 50 = 21

Therefore, after the children picked 50 cucumbers for their school project, there are 21 cucumbers left in the large vegetable garden.

Given:
* After the gusty period, there were 25 beach balls left on the beach.
* 71 new colorful beach balls were delivered to the beach.

To find the total number of beach balls now at the beach, we need to add the number of beach balls left after the gusty period and the number of new beach balls delivered.

Calculation:
* Total beach balls = Beach balls left after gusty period + New beach balls delivered
* Total beach balls = 25 + 71 = 96

So, there are now 96 beach balls at the beach.

* The chef needs to prepare 30 identical meals.
* He also needs to prepare an extra meal for tasting.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:
1. Find the total number of meals the chef needs to prepare:
   - Regular meals = 30
   - Extra meal for tasting = 1
   - Total meals = 30 + 1 = 31

2. Calculate the total number of tablespoons of salt needed:
   - Salt needed per meal = 1 tablespoon
   - Total meals = 31
   - Total salt needed = 1 tablespoon × 31 = 31 tablespoons

Therefore, the chef would need 31 tablespoons of salt in total.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We know that:
* The chef has a container with 60 tablespoons of salt.
* He used 31 tablespoons of salt to prepare the meals.

To find out how many tablespoons of salt are left in the container, we need to subtract the used amount from the initial amount.

1. Calculate the remaining tablespoons of salt:
   - Initial amount of salt = 60 tablespoons
   - Used amount of salt = 31 tablespoons
   - Remaining salt = Initial amount - Used amount
   - Remaining salt = 60 tablespoons - 31 tablespoons = 29 tablespoons

So, after preparing the meals, the chef has 29 tablespoons of salt left in the container.

1. Calculate how many pens Sarah has after giving away some to her friends:
   * Remaining pens = Initial pens - Pens given away
   * Remaining pens = 40 - 27 = 13

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate how many pens Sarah has after giving away some to her friends:
   * Remaining pens = Initial pens - Pens given away
   * Remaining pens = 77 - 27 = 50

2. Compare Sarah's remaining pens with the winner's collection:
   * Sarah's remaining pens = 50
   * Winner's pens = 51
   * 50 &lt; 51, so Sarah needs more pens to match the winner's collection.

3. Calculate how many more pens Sarah needs to match the winner's collection:

        In the magical land of Unica, consider again the unicorns that were spotted. Supposedly instead of 33 unicorns in the morning, there were actually 58 unicorns. The same number of 33 unicorns are still seen in the afternoon, and the pair of rare twin unicorns is still there. Now, how many unicorns are in Unica in total?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step with the updated information:

1. Understand the given information:
   * 58 unicorns were spotted in the morning (updated from 33).
   * 33 unicorns were seen in the afternoon (same as before).
   * A pair of rare twin unicorns joined the other unicorns (same as before).

2. Calculate the total number of unicorns without the rare twin unicorns:
   * Total unicorns = Morning unicorns + Afternoon unicorns
   * Total unicorns = 58 + 33 = 91

3. Add the pair of rare twin unicorns to the total:
   * Total unicorns in Unica = Total unicorns + Rare twin unicorns
   * Total unicorns in Unica = 91 + 2 = 93

        Galaxy Man, a superhero, has been on 94 missions since he started his career. In 18 of these missions, he had to collaborate with other superheroes. How many missions did Galaxy Man complete on his own?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Galaxy Man has been on a total of 94 missions.
* Out of these 94 missions, he collaborated with other superheroes on 18 missions.

To find out how many missions Galaxy Man completed on his own, we need to subtract the number of collaborative missions from the total number of missions.

Total missions = 94
Collaborative missions = 18
Missions on his own = Total missions - Collaborative missions
Missions on his own = 94 - 18 = 76

Therefore, Galaxy Man completed 76 missions on his own.

        If instead of 94 missions, Galaxy Man had only been on 28 missions since the start of his career, with the same 18 missions involving other superheroes, how many missions would Galaxy Man have completed alone?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information based on the new scenario:
* Galaxy Man has now been on a total of 28 missions (instead of 94).
* He still collaborated with other superheroes on 18 missions.

We'll use the same approach as before to find out how many missions Galaxy Man completed on his own:

Total missions = 28
Collaborative missions = 18
Missions on his own = Total missions - Collaborative missions
Missions on his own = 28 - 18 = 10

However, there's a problem with this result. If Galaxy Man collaborated on 18 missions out of a total of 28 missions, it's not possible for him to have completed 10 missions on his own. The number of collaborative missions cannot exceed the total number of missions.

In this scenario, the maximum number of missions Galaxy Man could have completed on his own is:
Missions on his own (maximum) = Total missions - Collaborative missions
Missions on his own (maximum) = 28 - 18 = 10

Therefore, with the given information, Galaxy Man could have completed a maximum of 10 missions on his own, assuming the number of collaborative missions is correct.

* The player has just earned 12 XP points.
* To level up, the player needs a total of 73 XP points plus the initial amount they just earned.

To find out how many XP points the player needs to level up, we need to:
1. Calculate the total XP points needed to level up by adding the 73 XP points to the initial amount earned.
2. Subtract the initial amount earned from the total XP points needed to level up.

Step 1: Calculate the total XP points needed to level up
* Total XP points needed = 73 + 12 = 85

Step 2: Subtract the initial amount earned from the total XP points needed
* XP points needed to level up = Total XP points needed - Initial amount earned
* XP points needed to level up = 85 - 12 = 73

Therefore, the player needs 73 more XP points to level up.

To find the total number of dragons in the kingdom after the gathering, we need to add the number of dragons that were already in the kingdom to the number of dragons that came from distant lands.

Total dragons after the gathering = Dragons in the kingdom + Dragons from distant lands

To find the total number of episodes Emily watched, we need to add the number of episodes she watched on both days.

Total episodes = Episodes watched on the first day + Episodes watched on the next day
Total episodes = 34 + 61
Total episodes = &lt;&lt;34+61=95&gt;&gt;95

Total episodes = Episodes watched on the first day + Episodes watched on the next day
Total episodes = 23 + 61
Total episodes = &lt;&lt;23+61=84&gt;&gt;84

2. Add the newly delivered components to the remaining components.

Step 1: Remaining components after the experiment
* Remaining components = Original components - Used components
* Remaining components = 40 - 11 = 29

Step 2: Total components after the new delivery
* Total components = Remaining components + Newly delivered components
* Total components = 29 + 47 = 76

Therefore, with the revised number of components used in the experiment, the total number of components in the laboratory now is 76.

   * Adult wolves = 7
   * Wolf cubs = 77
   * Initial wolf population = Adult wolves + Wolf cubs
   * Initial wolf population = 7 + 77 = 84 wolves

2. Calculate the remaining wolf population after migration:

   * Adult wolves = 7
   * Wolf cubs = 77
   * Initial wolf population (w) = Adult wolves + Wolf cubs
   * Initial wolf population (w) = 7 + 77 = 84 wolves

2. Calculate the remaining wolf population after the first migration:
   * Wolves that migrated in the first event = 40
   * Wolf population after the first migration = Initial wolf population - Wolves that migrated
   * Wolf population after the first migration = 84 - 40 = 44 wolves

3. Calculate the remaining wolf population after the second migration:
   * Wolves that migrated in the second event (to the mountainside) = 14
   * Final wolf population = Wolf population after the first migration - Wolves that migrated to the mountainside
   * Final wolf population = 44 - 14 = 30 wolves

Therefore, after the two migration events, there are 30 wolves left in the forest.

   * Initial wolf population = 7 + 68 = 75 wolves

2. Calculate the remaining wolf population after migration:
   * Wolves that migrated = 40
   * Remaining wolf population = Initial wolf population - Wolves that migrated
   * Remaining wolf population = 75 - 40 = 35 wolves

Therefore, with the updated number of wolf cubs (68 instead of 77) and after 40 wolves migrated to another forest, there are 35 wolves left in the forest.

To find the total number of cookies you have baked, we need to add the initial number of cookies to the additional cookies you baked with the leftover dough.

Total cookies = Initial cookies + Additional cookies
Total cookies = 75 + 4
Total cookies = 79

Therefore, if you initially baked 75 cookies and then decided to bake an additional 4 cookies with the leftover dough, you would have a total of 79 cookies.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:
1. Find the number of boards left after preparation:
   * Boards left = Initial boards - Boards used in preparation
   * Boards left = 78 - 73 = &lt;&lt;78-73=5&gt;&gt;5 boards

2. Find the additional boards needed to meet the demand:

Given:
* The carpenter can only afford to make 14 tables due to other limitations.
* Each smaller table requires only one board of wood.
* The carpenter has 5 boards of wood left.

Now, let's find out how many fewer tables he can produce compared to his original plan:

1. Find the number of tables the carpenter can make with the current boards:
   * Tables he can make = Boards of wood left
   * Tables he can make = 5 tables

2. Find the difference between the planned number of tables and the actual number of tables he can make:
   * Difference = Planned tables - Tables he can make
   * Difference = 14 - 5 = &lt;&lt;14-5=9&gt;&gt;9 tables

Therefore, the carpenter will be able to produce 9 fewer tables than his original plan of making 14 tables.

To find the total number of stars the astronomer saw, we need to add all the stars he saw during the evening.

Total stars = Initial star + Stars seen as eyes adjusted + Stars spotted during meteor shower
Total stars = 1 + 5 + 28

Given:
* The astronomer saw a total of 34 stars.
* A cloud temporarily covered 27 stars.

To find the number of stars left visible after the cloud passed, we need to subtract the number of stars covered by the cloud from the total number of stars.

Stars left visible = Total stars - Stars covered by the cloud
Stars left visible = 34 - 27
Stars left visible = &lt;&lt;34-27=7&gt;&gt;7

        After reflecting on her work, the author decides that she should have originally written 79 pages in the first session instead of 74. Keeping the additional 16 pages she wrote after, how many total pages of the novel does she have before adding the one-page introduction?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information based on the author's reflection:
* The author should have written 79 pages in the first session instead of 74.
* She still wrote an additional 16 pages after the first session.
* She plans to add a one-page introduction, but we need to calculate the total pages before adding the introduction.

To find the updated total number of pages she has written before adding the introduction, we need to add the revised number of pages from the first session and the additional pages she wrote.

Total pages before introduction = Revised pages from the first session + Additional pages
Total pages before introduction = 79 + 16
Total pages before introduction = 95

Therefore, the author has written a total of 95 pages before adding the one-page introduction.

To find the total number of rooms after the expansion, we need to add the initial number of rooms and the number of rooms added:

Total rooms after expansion = Initial rooms + Added rooms
Total rooms after expansion = 60 + 22
Total rooms after expansion = 82

Therefore, after the expansion, the hotel has 82 rooms.

To find the total number of rooms after the first expansion with 11 additional rooms, we need to add the initial number of rooms and the new number of rooms added:

Total rooms after first expansion = Initial rooms + Added rooms
Total rooms after first expansion = 60 + 11
Total rooms after first expansion = 71

Therefore, if the hotel owner added 11 rooms instead of 22 during the first expansion, the hotel would have 71 rooms after the first expansion.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 70 children in the park.
2. Some children left, leaving only 27 children in the park.
3. We don't need to calculate how many children left in this step, as we are given the remaining number of children.
4. Later, 31 more children left the park.
5. To find the number of children left in the park now, we need to subtract 31 from the remaining 27 children.

27 - 31 = -4

However, it's not possible to have a negative number of children. This means that the question doesn't provide a realistic scenario. All the children had already left the park before the additional 31 children were said to have left.

Therefore, there are 0 children left in the park.

Bees left in the beehive = Total bees - Bees that left
Bees left in the beehive = 48 - 29

To find the number of bees left in the beehive after the drones departed, we need to subtract the number of drones that left from the initial number of bees in the beehive.

Bees left in the beehive = Initial number of bees - Drones that left
Bees left in the beehive = 89 - 29
Bees left in the beehive = &lt;&lt;89-29=60&gt;&gt;60

So, after the 29 drone bees left for the pollen gathering mission, there were 60 bees left in the beehive.

- 22 erasers were used up during classes and craft projects.
- A generous donor contributed an additional 39 erasers to the school.

Step 1: Calculate the number of erasers left after some were used up.
Erasers left = Initial number of erasers - Used erasers
Erasers left = 35 - 22 = 13

Step 2: Add the donated erasers to the remaining erasers to get the total number of erasers at the school now.

* After removing 55 beds for refurbishment, there were 20 beds remaining (from the previous question).
* The sponsor donated an additional set of beds.
* The number of new beds plus the remaining beds equals the original number of beds, which is 75.

Let's find the number of beds donated by the sponsor.

Remaining beds + Donated beds = Original number of beds
20 + Donated beds = 75

To find the number of donated beds, we subtract the remaining beds from both sides of the equation:
Donated beds = 75 - 20
Donated beds = &lt;&lt;75-20=55&gt;&gt;55

Therefore, the generous sponsor donated 55 beds to the hostel.

        After giving 22 of his toy cars to his younger brother, Tommy visits a toy store and discovers a toy car that he must have. It costs 61 toy cars for a trade. Does Tommy have enough toy cars left to trade for the new one? If not, how many more does he need?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's continue from the previous problem and solve this one step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tommy has 48 toy cars left in his collection after giving 22 to his younger brother.
   * The toy store offers a trade: 61 toy cars for a new car that Tommy wants.

2. Compare the number of toy cars Tommy has with the number of toy cars needed for the trade:
   * Tommy has 48 toy cars.
   * The trade requires 61 toy cars.
   * 48 &lt; 61, so Tommy does not have enough toy cars to make the trade.

3. Calculate how many more toy cars Tommy needs to make the trade:
   * Additional toy cars needed = Trade requirement - Tommy's current toy cars
   * Additional toy cars needed = 61 - 48
   * Additional toy cars needed = &lt;&lt;61-48=13&gt;&gt;13

Therefore, Tommy does not have enough toy cars to trade for the new one. He needs 13 more toy cars to make the trade.

### Answer: Tommy needs 13 more toy cars to trade for the new one.</pre>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tommy has a collection of 70 toy cars.
   * He decides to give 17 of his toy cars to his younger brother (instead of 22).

2. To find out how many toy cars Tommy has left, we need to subtract the number of cars he gave away from his total collection:
   * Toy cars left = Total toy cars - Toy cars given away
   * Toy cars left = 70 - 17
   * Toy cars left = &lt;&lt;70-17=53&gt;&gt;53

So, after giving 17 toy cars to his younger brother, Tommy has 53 toy cars left in his collection.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Initially, there were 87 Strawberry plants on the farm.
* 41 plants were lost due to a disease.
* Jacob added 8 new Strawberry plants.

To find the current number of Strawberry plants on the farm, we need to:
1. Subtract the number of plants lost from the initial number of plants.
2. Add the number of new plants to the remaining plants.

Step 1: 87 - 41 = 46
After the disease, there were 46 Strawberry plants left on the farm.

Step 2: 46 + 8 = 54

1. The scientist first discovered a group of 34 dinosaurs of the new species.
2. Later, he found another group of the same species, which also had 34 dinosaurs.
3. To find the total number of dinosaurs, we need to add the number of dinosaurs in both groups.

Total dinosaurs = Dinosaurs in the first group + Dinosaurs in the second group
Total dinosaurs = 34 + 34
Total dinosaurs = 68

- The scientist initially found two groups of 34 dinosaurs each, making a total of 68 dinosaurs.
- The scientist then discovered an additional nest with 6 more dinosaurs of the same species.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of dinosaurs found in the additional nest.
Additional dinosaurs = 6

Step 2: Add the number of dinosaurs found in the additional nest to the total number of dinosaurs found initially.
Total dinosaurs = Initial total + Additional dinosaurs
Total dinosaurs = 68 + 6
Total dinosaurs = 74

Therefore, the scientist has now found a total of 74 dinosaurs of the new species.

To find the total number of dinosaurs, we need to add the number of dinosaurs in both groups.

Total dinosaurs = Dinosaurs in the first group + Dinosaurs in the second group
Total dinosaurs = 37 + 37
Total dinosaurs = 74

Using the same approach as before, we can calculate the number of remaining, undamaged beach balls by subtracting the number of lost or damaged balls from the total number of balls:

Remaining balls = Total balls - Lost or damaged balls
Remaining balls = 82 - 60 = 22

Therefore, if 60 beach balls were lost or damaged, there would be 22 beach balls left undamaged on the beach.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. Understand the new given information:
   * The factory made 76 windows in the morning (instead of 41).
   * 21 of those windows were defective and had to be discarded (same as before).

2. To find the number of windows left, we need to subtract the defective windows from the total windows made:
   * Windows left = Total windows made - Defective windows
   * Windows left = 76 - 21
   * Windows left = &lt;&lt;76-21=55&gt;&gt;55

Therefore, after discarding the defective windows, there are 55 windows left in this updated situation.

To find out how many roses are missing, we need to subtract the number of roses left from the original number of roses.

Missing roses = Original number of roses - Number of roses left
Missing roses = 88 - 84
Missing roses = &lt;&lt;88-84=4&gt;&gt;4

1. Understand the given information:
   * The helicopter piloting school initially has 19 students.
   * The school enrolls an equal number of new students during the next intake.

2. To find the total number of students after the new intake, we need to:
   * Take the initial number of students (19)
   * Add the number of new students enrolled (which is equal to the initial number of students)

3. Calculate the number of new students enrolled:
   * New students enrolled = Initial number of students = 19

4. Calculate the total number of students after the new intake:

Given:
- The helicopter piloting school initially has 30 students.
- The school enrolls an equal number of new students during the next intake.

Step 1: Determine the number of new students enrolled.
New students enrolled = Initial number of students = 30

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students after the new intake.
Total students = Initial students + New students
Total students = 30 + 30 = 60

Therefore, if the helicopter piloting school started with 30 students and enrolled an equal number of new students during the next intake, there would be 60 students in the school now.

* Sam's piano has a total of 58 keys.
* 33 of the keys are broken and can't be used.
* Sam fixes some keys and adds 14 more functional keys.

To find out how many keys Sam can play after adding the new ones, we need to:
1. Find the number of working keys before adding the new ones.
2. Add the 14 new functional keys to the working keys.

Step 1: Find the number of working keys before adding the new ones
* Total keys = 58
* Broken keys = 33
* Working keys = Total keys - Broken keys
* Working keys = 58 - 33 = 25

Step 2: Add the 14 new functional keys to the working keys
* New working keys = Old working keys + Added functional keys

Given:
* Sam currently has 39 working keys on his piano.
* He needs a total of 56 keys to play the new songs.

To find out how many more keys Sam needs to fix, we can:
1. Calculate the difference between the required keys and the current working keys.

Step 1: Calculate the difference between the required keys and the current working keys
* Additional keys needed = Required keys - Current working keys
* Additional keys needed = 56 - 39 = 17

Therefore, Sam needs to fix 17 more keys on his piano to have a total of 56 working keys, which will allow him to play the new songs.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Initially, there are 23 stuffed animals on display.
   * The shop owner adds 35 more stuffed animals to the display.

2. To find the total number of stuffed animals on display after adding the new ones, we need to add the initial number of stuffed animals to the number of added stuffed animals.

3. Add the stuffed animals:
   * Total stuffed animals = Initial stuffed animals + Added stuffed animals
   * Total stuffed animals = 23 + 35
   * Total stuffed animals = 58

Therefore, after the shop owner adds the new stuffed animals, there will be 58 stuffed animals on display.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* There are 48 small kites at the festival
* There are 32 large kites at the festival
* Initially, there were 91 kites available

To find out how many kites were sold before the festival, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of kites at the festival
2. Subtract the number of kites at the festival from the initial number of kites

Step 1: Calculate the total number of kites at the festival
* Total kites at the festival = Small kites + Large kites
* Total kites at the festival = 48 + 32 = 80

Step 2: Subtract the number of kites at the festival from the initial number of kites
* Kites sold before the festival = Initial kites - Kites at the festival
* Kites sold before the festival = 91 - 80 = 11

Therefore, 11 kites were sold before the festival started.

        In continuation of the previous problem, let's say there was another booth selling kites at the festival. Initially, they had 59 kites. After the festival started, they observed that they had sold the same number of kites as the number of kites remaining from the initial batch of 91 kites. How many kites did the second booth have left after these sales?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the information from the previous problem and the new information provided.

Given:
- Initially, there were 91 kites available at the first booth.
- 11 kites were sold from the first booth before the festival started.
- The second booth initially had 59 kites.
- The second booth sold the same number of kites as the number of kites remaining from the initial 91 kites at the first booth.

Step 1: Determine the number of kites remaining from the initial 91 kites at the first booth.
Kites remaining at the first booth = Initial kites - Kites sold before the festival
Kites remaining at the first booth = 91 - 11 = 80

Step 2: Calculate the number of kites sold by the second booth.
Kites sold by the second booth = Kites remaining at the first booth = 80

Step 3: Calculate the number of kites left at the second booth after the sales.
Kites left at the second booth = Initial kites at the second booth - Kites sold by the second booth
Kites left at the second booth = 59 - 80 = -21

However, it is not possible to have a negative number of kites. This means that the second booth did not have enough kites to sell the same number as the remaining kites from the first booth's initial batch.

### Answer: The second booth did not have enough kites to sell the same number as the remaining kites from the first booth's initial batch.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the updated information:
* There are 24 small kites at the festival
* There are 32 large kites at the festival (same as before)
* Initially, there were 91 kites available (same as before)

To find out how many kites were sold before the festival with the updated scenario, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of kites at the festival
2. Subtract the number of kites at the festival from the initial number of kites

Step 1: Calculate the total number of kites at the festival
* Total kites at the festival = Small kites + Large kites
* Total kites at the festival = 24 + 32 = 56

Step 2: Subtract the number of kites at the festival from the initial number of kites
* Kites sold before the festival = Initial kites - Kites at the festival

        A pirate buries his treasure chest which is 99 paces from the entrance of the cove.

How many paces does the pirate now need to walk to reach his treasure?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initially, the treasure was 99 paces from the entrance of the cove.

2. After a year, the entrance moved 32 paces closer to the treasure.

3. To find the new distance between the entrance and the treasure, we need to subtract the distance the entrance moved from the original distance:

   New distance = Original distance - Distance the entrance moved
                = 99 paces - 32 paces
                = 67 paces

Therefore, the pirate now needs to walk 67 paces to reach his treasure.

        In the previous scenario, the pirate realized his treasure was 'g' paces away from the cove's entrance after the geologic changes. But, what if the geologic shift wasn't as dramatic and it only brought the cove's entrance 26 paces closer instead of 32 paces to his buried treasure? How many paces would the pirate now need to walk from the cove's entrance to reach his treasure?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the given information. We'll use the variable 'g' to represent the number of paces the pirate needs to walk from the cove's entrance to his treasure after the geologic changes.

Given:
- Initially, the treasure was 99 paces from the entrance of the cove.
- After the geologic shift, the cove's entrance moved 26 paces closer to the treasure.

To find the number of paces the pirate needs to walk from the cove's entrance to his treasure, we can set up an equation:

Initial distance - Distance the entrance moved = New distance (g)
99 paces - 26 paces = g

Now, let's solve the equation:
99 - 26 = g
73 = g

Therefore, after the geologic shift that brought the cove's entrance 26 paces closer to his buried treasure, the pirate would need to walk 73 paces from the cove's entrance to reach his treasure.

Step 1: Add the updated number of red marbles and the unchanged number of blue marbles.
Total marbles = Red marbles + Blue marbles
Total marbles = 10 + 44

* They sold 25 rings in the morning.
* Their target inventory for the day is 92 rings more than what they have now.

To find out how many rings they are short of their target, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of rings they have now.
2. Subtract the current number of rings from the target number of rings.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rings they have now
* Rings at the start of the day = 90
* Rings sold in the morning = 25
* Current number of rings = 90 - 25 = 65

Step 2: Subtract the current number of rings from the target number of rings
* Target number of rings = Current number of rings + 92
* Target number of rings = 65 + 92 = 157
* Rings short of the target = Target number of rings - Current number of rings
* Rings short of the target = 157 - 65 = 92

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The company currently owns 30 helicopters.
* They decide to add 31 more helicopters to the fleet.

To find the total number of helicopters in the company's fleet after adding the new helicopters, we need to add the current number of helicopters to the number of helicopters being added.

Current number of helicopters: 30
Number of helicopters being added: 31

Total number of helicopters = Current number of helicopters + Number of helicopters being added
Total number of helicopters = 30 + 31 = &lt;&lt;30+31=61&gt;&gt;61

Therefore, after adding the new helicopters, the company's fleet will have a total of 61 helicopters.

Given:
* The company originally owned 63 helicopters.
* They decided to add 31 more helicopters to the fleet.

To find the total number of helicopters in the company's fleet after adding the new helicopters, we need to add the original number of helicopters to the number of helicopters being added.

Original number of helicopters: 63
Number of helicopters being added: 31

Total number of helicopters = Original number of helicopters + Number of helicopters being added
Total number of helicopters = 63 + 31 = &lt;&lt;63+31=94&gt;&gt;94

Therefore, with the updated scenario, the company's fleet will have a total of 94 helicopters after adding the new helicopters.

Given:
- Penny needs $2 more to buy the bag.

Step 1: Determine the number of jobs Penny needs to do to earn the additional money.
Number of jobs = Additional money needed = $2

Step 2: Calculate the total money Penny would make by doing the same number of jobs as the additional money she needs.
Money earned = Number of jobs × Earnings per job
Money earned = $2 × $33
Money earned = $66

        Let's suppose that instead of 50 spots for cars, the factory had only 45. In that case, currently there are 21 cars that are fully completed. The rest of the spots are reserved for the cars which are still under process. How many cars are still under process now?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information based on the new scenario:
* There are 45 spots reserved for completed cars in the factory.
* Currently, 21 cars are fully completed.
* The remaining spots are reserved for cars still under process.

To find the number of cars still under process, we follow the same steps as before:
1. Find the number of remaining spots by subtracting the number of completed cars from the total number of spots.

Remaining spots = Total spots - Completed cars
Remaining spots = 45 - 21 = 24

Therefore, with 45 spots in the factory and 21 cars fully completed, there are 24 spots reserved for cars still under process.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The store received two varieties of colored pencil packs:
  - Packs with 32 colored pencils
  - Packs with 62 colored pencils
* We have one pack of each variety

Now, let's find the total number of colored pencils:
* Total colored pencils = Number of pencils in the 32-pack + Number of pencils in the 62-pack
* Total colored pencils = 32 + 62
* Total colored pencils = &lt;&lt;32+62=94&gt;&gt;94

Therefore, if you have one pack of each variety, there are 94 colored pencils in total.

Now, let's calculate the total number of colored pencils:
* Total colored pencils = Number of single pencils + Number of pencils in the 62-pack
* Total colored pencils = 1 + 62
* Total colored pencils = &lt;&lt;1+62=63&gt;&gt;63

Therefore, with 1 single colored pencil and 1 pack of 62 colored pencils, there would be 63 colored pencils in total.

* It needs an additional 10 tons of fuel for the rest of the journey.
* Due to an unexpected issue, it needs an extra 2 tons of fuel.

To find the total amount of fuel needed, we need to add these three quantities together:

Initial boost fuel + Rest of journey fuel + Extra fuel = Total fuel needed

Gems given away = &lt;&lt;100-62=38&gt;&gt;38

So, when Jacob initially had 100 gems and was left with 62 gems, he gave away 38 gems.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* There are 27 scented candles
* There are 36 unscented candles
* The store owner puts 30 candles on sale

To find out how many candles are not on sale, we need to:
1. Find the total number of candles in the store
2. Subtract the number of candles on sale from the total

Step 1: Find the total number of candles
* Total candles = Scented candles + Unscented candles
* Total candles = 27 + 36 = &lt;&lt;27+36=63&gt;&gt;63

Step 2: Subtract the number of candles on sale from the total
* Candles not on sale = Total candles - Candles on sale
* Candles not on sale = 63 - 30 = &lt;&lt;63-30=33&gt;&gt;33

Therefore, 33 candles are not on sale.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue with the problem. We already know that there were 33 candles not on sale.

Given:
* 14 more candles are sold after the owner decides on which candles to put on sale.

To find out how many candles are left in the store, we need to:
1. Subtract the number of candles sold from the number of candles not on sale.

Step 1: Subtract the number of candles sold from the number of candles not on sale
* Candles left in the store = Candles not on sale - Candles sold
* Candles left in the store = 33 - 14 = &lt;&lt;33-14=19&gt;&gt;19

Therefore, there are 19 candles left in the store.

        In the original scenario, let's consider instead that there were 73 unscented candles instead of 36 in the candle store. Similar to the original scenario, the store owner decides to put 30 candles on sale. Now, how many candles are not on sale?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the updated information:
* There are 27 scented candles
* There are 73 unscented candles (updated from 36)
* The store owner puts 30 candles on sale

To find out how many candles are not on sale, we follow the same steps as before:
1. Find the total number of candles in the store
2. Subtract the number of candles on sale from the total

Step 1: Find the total number of candles
* Total candles = Scented candles + Unscented candles
* Total candles = 27 + 73 = &lt;&lt;27+73=100&gt;&gt;100

Step 2: Subtract the number of candles on sale from the total
* Candles not on sale = Total candles - Candles on sale
* Candles not on sale = 100 - 30 = &lt;&lt;100-30=70&gt;&gt;70

Therefore, with the updated number of unscented candles, 70 candles are not on sale.

Given:
- The store had 91 pairs of pants left after selling 4 pairs.
- The store receives a small shipment of 3 more pairs of pants to restock.

To find the total number of pairs of pants now in the store, we need to add the number of pairs restocked to the number of pairs left after selling:

Pairs of pants now in store = Pairs of pants left after selling + Pairs of pants restocked
Pairs of pants now in store = 91 + 3
Pairs of pants now in store = &lt;&lt;91+3=94&gt;&gt;94

2. To find the number of pairs of pants left in the store, we need to subtract the updated number of pairs sold from the initial number of pairs in stock:
   * Pairs of pants left = Initial pairs of pants - Pairs of pants sold
   * Pairs of pants left = 95 - 9

- The teacher brings in an additional 9 pencils.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining pencils after distribution.
Remaining pencils after distribution = Initial pencils - Distributed pencils
Remaining pencils after distribution = 35 - 30 = 5 pencils

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pencils in the classroom after the teacher brings in the additional pencils.
Total pencils now = Remaining pencils after distribution + Additional pencils
Total pencils now = 5 + 9 = 14 pencils

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the updated information:
* Fiona's usual practice time: 28 minutes
* Extra practice time: 8 minutes
* Additional song practice time: 34 minutes

To find the total minutes Fiona practiced piano that day, we need to add her usual practice time, the extra minutes, and the additional song practice time.

Usual practice time: 28 minutes
Extra practice time: 8 minutes
Additional song practice time: 34 minutes

Total practice time = Usual practice time + Extra practice time + Additional song practice time
Total practice time = 28 + 8 + 34 = &lt;&lt;28+8+34=70&gt;&gt;70 minutes

Therefore, with the additional song practice, Fiona practiced piano for a total of 70 minutes that day.

Given:
* Fiona starts her practice session by practicing for 28 minutes.
* She then decides to extend her practice time by an extra 20 minutes.

To find the total minutes Fiona practiced piano that day, we need to add her initial practice time and the extra minutes she practiced.

Initial practice time: 28 minutes
Extra practice time: 20 minutes

Total practice time = Initial practice time + Extra practice time
Total practice time = 28 + 20 = &lt;&lt;28+20=48&gt;&gt;48 minutes

In this scenario, Fiona practiced piano for a total of 48 minutes on the day she extended her practice time by 20 minutes.

1. The artisan initially has 75 beads.
2. He uses 55 beads for a large commissioned piece.
3. To find the number of beads left after using 55, we subtract:
   75 - 55 = 20 beads

4. The artisan receives another shipment with the same number of beads as he currently has, which is 20.
5. To find the total number of beads the artisan has now, we add:

Given:
- The artisan had 40 beads after using 55 beads from his initial stock of 75 and receiving a new shipment.
- The artisan now acquires an additional set of 29 special beads.

To find the total number of beads the artisan has now, we need to add his current stock and the new special beads.

Current stock: 40 beads
Special beads: 29 beads

Total beads = Current stock + Special beads
Total beads = 40 + 29 = 69 beads

Given:
- The artisan initially has 99 beads.
- He uses 55 beads for a large commissioned piece.
- He receives another shipment with the same number of beads as he currently has after using 55 beads.

Step 1: Calculate the number of beads left after using 55 beads.
99 - 55 = 44 beads

Step 2: The artisan receives another shipment with the same number of beads as he currently has, which is 44.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of beads the artisan has now by adding the current number of beads and the number of beads in the new shipment.
44 + 44 = 88 beads

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1) First, let's understand what time it is when it's 73 minutes past 12:00 noon.
   73 minutes is 1 hour and 13 minutes. So, 73 minutes past 12:00 noon is 1:13 PM.

2) Now, we need to subtract 67 minutes from 1:13 PM.
   67 minutes is 1 hour and 7 minutes. So, if we subtract 1 hour and 7 minutes from 1:13 PM, we get 12:06 PM.

3) The question asks at what minute into the next hour the minute hand will be pointing. 
   The next hour after 12:06 PM is 1:00 PM. And 12:06 PM is 6 minutes into the 12:00 hour.

Therefore, the minute hand will be pointing at 6 minutes into the next hour, which is 1:00 PM.

- We need to subtract 2 minutes from this time.

Step 1: Determine the time 73 minutes past 12:00 noon.
73 minutes past 12:00 noon is the same as 1:13 PM because 73 minutes is equal to 1 hour and 13 minutes.

Step 2: Subtract 2 minutes from 1:13 PM.
1:13 PM - 2 minutes = 1:11 PM

Step 3: Determine how many minutes into the next hour the minute hand will be pointing.
The next hour after 1:11 PM is 2:00 PM. The minute hand will be pointing 11 minutes into the next hour.

* There are currently 97 dolphins in the Pacific ocean.
* 45 dolphins migrated to another place due to hunting activities.

To find out how many dolphins are left in the Pacific ocean, we need to subtract the number of dolphins that migrated from the total number of dolphins.

Dolphins left = Total dolphins - Dolphins that migrated
Dolphins left = 97 - 45 = 52

Therefore, there are 52 dolphins left in the Pacific ocean.

Given:
- After the migration, there were 52 dolphins left in the Pacific ocean.
- A group of 19 dolphins from elsewhere joined the remaining group in the Pacific ocean.

To find the total number of dolphins now making the Pacific ocean their home, we need to add the number of dolphins that joined the remaining group to the number of dolphins left after the migration.

Total dolphins = Dolphins left after migration + Dolphins that joined
Total dolphins = 52 + 19 = 71

Given:
* In this scenario, there are 61 dolphins in the Pacific ocean initially.
* 45 dolphins migrated to another place due to hunting activities.

To find out how many dolphins would be left in the Pacific ocean in this scenario, we need to subtract the number of dolphins that migrated from the new total number of dolphins.

Dolphins left = Total dolphins - Dolphins that migrated
Dolphins left = 61 - 45 = 16

1. Determine how many people were on the bus before the first stop.
2. Subtract the number of people who got off at the first stop.

Step 1: Determine the number of people on the bus before the first stop
* The bus was fully occupied, so there were 55 people on the bus, including the driver.

Step 2: Subtract the number of people who got off at the first stop

        Suppose initially, the lake had 20 million gallons of water instead of 35 million gallons before the heavy rainfall. Now, how many million gallons of water does the lake contain in total after the same 45 million gallons of rainwater is added?
    </p>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information:
* The lake initially had 20 million gallons of water (instead of 35 million gallons).
* Due to heavy rain, an additional 45 million gallons of water was added to the lake.

To find the total amount of water in the lake now, we need to add the initial amount of water and the additional water from the heavy rain.

Initial water in the lake: 20 million gallons
Additional water from heavy rain: 45 million gallons

Total water in the lake = Initial water + Additional water
Total water in the lake = 20 million gallons + 45 million gallons
Total water in the lake = 65 million gallons

### Answer: The lake now contains a total of 65 million gallons of water.</pre>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Find the total number of tables in the banquet hall initially:
   * Tables on the left side = 34
   * Tables on the right side = 19
   * Total tables = 34 + 19 = 53

2. Calculate the number of tables left after 52 tables were shifted:
   * Tables shifted to another hall = 52
   * Tables left in the banquet hall = Total tables - Tables shifted
   * Tables left in the banquet hall = 53 - 52 = 1

Therefore, after shifting 52 tables to another hall, there is only 1 table left in the banquet hall.

        After the end of the event, the management decided to add 35 more tables to the left side of the banquet hall along with the existing 34 tables. However, again 52 tables were moved out for another small event. Now, how many tables are left in the banquet hall after this shift?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, considering the changes made to the number of tables in the banquet hall.

Given:
- Initially, there were 34 tables on the left side and 19 tables on the right side.
- 35 more tables were added to the left side.
- 52 tables were moved out for another small event.

Step 1: Calculate the new number of tables on the left side after adding 35 more tables.
New tables on the left side = Existing tables on the left side + Added tables
New tables on the left side = 34 + 35 = 69

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tables in the banquet hall after adding the tables.
Total tables = New tables on the left side + Tables on the right side
Total tables = 69 + 19 = 88

Step 3: Calculate the number of tables left in the banquet hall after moving out 52 tables.
Tables left = Total tables - Tables moved out
Tables left = 88 - 52 = 36

Therefore, after adding 35 tables to the left side and moving out 52 tables for another small event, there are 36 tables left in the banquet hall.

To find the total number of people the superhero saved in this scenario, we need to add the updated number of people he saved from the fire and the number of people he saved from other crises.

Total people saved = People saved from the fire + People saved from other crises
Total people saved = 80 + 18

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* The first spell requires:
  - 11 different herbs
  - 57 assorted crystals
* The second potion needs:
  - 26 rare ingredients
  - All the ingredients from the first spell

To find the total number of ingredients needed for the second potion, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of ingredients in the first spell
2. Add the number of rare ingredients needed for the second potion to the total from step 1

Step 1: Total ingredients in the first spell
* Total ingredients = Number of herbs + Number of crystals
* Total ingredients = 11 + 57 = 68

Step 2: Total ingredients needed for the second potion
* Total ingredients = Ingredients from the first spell + Rare ingredients for the second potion
* Total ingredients = 68 + 26 = 94

Therefore, the wizard needs a total of 94 ingredients for the second potion.

        After the wizard consolidated his potion-making knowledge from his earlier concoctions, he decided to modify the second potion. Instead of combining 26 rare ingredients as he did previously, he opts to combine only 18 rare ingredients with all the ingredients from the first potion. How many total ingredients does the wizard now need for this modified version of the second potion?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's update the information for the modified version of the second potion:
* The first spell still requires:
  - 11 different herbs
  - 57 assorted crystals
* The modified second potion now needs:
  - 18 rare ingredients (instead of 26)
  - All the ingredients from the first spell

We can use the same steps as before to find the total number of ingredients needed for the modified second potion:
1. Calculate the total number of ingredients in the first spell (unchanged)
2. Add the updated number of rare ingredients needed for the modified second potion to the total from step 1

Step 1: Total ingredients in the first spell
* Total ingredients = Number of herbs + Number of crystals
* Total ingredients = 11 + 57 = 68

Step 2: Total ingredients needed for the modified second potion
* Total ingredients = Ingredients from the first spell + Updated rare ingredients for the modified second potion
* Total ingredients = 68 + 18 = 86

Therefore, the wizard now needs a total of 86 ingredients for the modified version of the second potion.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this new scenario, we have the original map with 13 treasure locations and a new map with 83 treasure locations. To find the total number of treasure locations on both maps, we need to add the number of locations from each map together.

Given:
- The first map has 13 treasure locations.
- The second map has 83 treasure locations.

To calculate the total number of treasure locations, we add the locations from both maps:

13 + 83 = 96

Therefore, there are a total of 96 treasure locations on both maps combined.

Given:
* Initially, you planted 26 carrot seeds.
* A few weeks later, you added 22 more seeds.
* The total number of carrot seeds after adding 22 more seeds was 48.
* Your neighbor gives you an additional 26 carrot seeds (the same number as you initially planted).

Step 1: Calculate the new total number of carrot seeds after adding the seeds from your neighbor.
* New total carrot seeds = Previous total + Seeds from your neighbor
* New total carrot seeds = 48 + 26
* New total carrot seeds = &lt;&lt;48+26=74&gt;&gt;74

Therefore, after adding the additional 26 carrot seeds from your neighbor, you now have a total of 74 carrot seeds in your carrot spot.

        At a beach party, there are 21 beach balls being played with. Suddenly, another batch of beach balls just as big as the first one arrived. How many beach balls are there at the party now?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 21 beach balls at the party.
2. Another batch of beach balls arrived, which was just as big as the first one. This means the number of beach balls in the second batch is equal to the number of beach balls in the first batch.
3. To find the total number of beach balls at the party now, we need to add the number of beach balls in the first batch and the second batch.

First batch of beach balls = 21
Second batch of beach balls = 21 (same as the first batch)

Total beach balls = First batch + Second batch
                  = 21 + 21
                  = 42

Therefore, there are now 42 beach balls at the party.

        At the beach party mentioned earlier, there were some beach balls already in a storage unit. After adding all the played and newly received beach balls, the total number of beach balls fell short of 62.

How many beach balls were originally in the storage unit before the party?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
- Initially, there were 21 beach balls being played with at the party.
- Another batch of beach balls, equal in number to the first batch, arrived later.
- There were some beach balls already in the storage unit before the party.
- After adding all the played and newly received beach balls to the storage unit, the total number of beach balls was less than 62.

To find the number of beach balls originally in the storage unit, we can:
1. Calculate the total number of beach balls that were played with and newly received.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of beach balls after adding them to the storage unit.

Beach balls played with = 21
Beach balls newly received = 21 (same as the played with)

Total beach balls played with and newly received = 21 + 21 = 42

Let's say the total number of beach balls after adding them to the storage unit is 61 (since it's less than 62).

Beach balls originally in the storage unit = Total beach balls after adding - Total beach balls played with and newly received
                                           = 61 - 42
                                           = 19

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same approach as before, but with the updated information.

Given:
- Initially, there were 29 beach balls at the party.
- Another batch of beach balls arrived, which was just as big as the first one.

Step 1: Determine the number of beach balls in the second batch.
Second batch of beach balls = First batch of beach balls = 29

Step 2: Calculate the total number of beach balls at the party now.
Total beach balls = First batch + Second batch
                  = 29 + 29
                  = 58

Therefore, with 29 beach balls in the first batch and another batch of the same size arriving, there would be 58 beach balls at the party.
