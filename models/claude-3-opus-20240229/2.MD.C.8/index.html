    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Liam had a total of $90.
   * The money was in twenties, tens, and fives.
   * Liam spent $81 on a new video game.

2. Calculate the amount of money Liam has left:
   * Money left = Total money - Money spent
   * Money left = $90 - $81
   * Money left = $9

Therefore, Liam has $9 left after buying the video game.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">I apologize for the confusion. Let's solve the problem with the updated information.

Given:
- Liam had $99 in twenties, tens, and fives.
- Liam spent $81 on a new video game.

To find out how much money Liam has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he had initially.

Money left = Total money - Money spent
Money left = $99 - $81
Money left = $18

Therefore, Liam has $18 left after buying the video game.

        Maria has 37 cents in nickels. After spending 12 cents on bubblegum, how much does she have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many nickels Maria has initially:
   * 1 nickel = 5 cents
   * 37 cents ÷ 5 cents per nickel = 7 remainder 2
   * So, Maria has 7 nickels and 2 cents left over.

2. Maria spends 12 cents on bubblegum:
   * 12 cents = 2 nickels + 2 cents
   * Maria spends 2 nickels and 2 cents on bubblegum.

3. Now, let's calculate how much money Maria has left:
   * Initial amount: 7 nickels and 2 cents
   * Spent: 2 nickels and 2 cents
   * Remaining: 7 - 2 = 5 nickels, and 2 - 2 = 0 cents
   * 5 nickels × 5 cents per nickel = 25 cents

Therefore, after spending 12 cents on bubblegum, Maria has 25 cents left.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off in the previous problem. We know that after spending 12 cents on bubblegum, Maria has 25 cents left.

Given:
- Maria has 25 cents left after spending 12 cents on bubblegum.
- She plans to save the same amount next week.

Now, let's calculate the total amount Maria will have after saving the same amount next week:

1. Amount saved this week:
   * Maria has 25 cents left, which she will save.

2. Amount saved next week:
   * Maria will save exactly the same amount next week, which is 25 cents.

3. Total amount saved:
   * Total = Amount saved this week + Amount saved next week
   * Total = 25 cents + 25 cents
   * Total = 50 cents

Therefore, if Maria manages to save exactly the same amount next week, she will have a total of 50 cents.

        Maria initially had 37 cents in nickels. However, instead of spending 12 cents on bubblegum, what if she spent 28 cents on bubblegum instead? How much money would she have left then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the new information:

1. We know that Maria initially has 37 cents in nickels:
   * 1 nickel = 5 cents
   * 37 cents ÷ 5 cents per nickel = 7 remainder 2
   * So, Maria has 7 nickels and 2 cents left over.

2. Now, Maria spends 28 cents on bubblegum:
   * 28 cents = 5 nickels + 3 cents
   * Maria spends 5 nickels and 3 cents on bubblegum.

3. Let's calculate how much money Maria has left:
   * Initial amount: 7 nickels and 2 cents
   * Spent: 5 nickels and 3 cents
   * Remaining: 7 - 5 = 2 nickels, but she doesn't have enough cents to cover the 3 cents spent
   * So, she needs to use one more nickel to cover the 3 cents
   * Final remaining amount: 1 nickel and 4 cents (2 cents left over + 2 cents change from the nickel)
   * 1 nickel × 5 cents per nickel + 4 cents = 9 cents

Therefore, after spending 28 cents on bubblegum, Maria would have 9 cents left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Mario initially saved $79 for the video game.

2. He spent $3 on a snack.
   * Remaining money after buying the snack = $79 - $3 = $76

3. He then bought the video game which costs $72.
   * Remaining money after buying the video game = $76 - $72 = $4

Therefore, Mario has $4 left after buying the snack and the video game.

* Lucas buys two toys.
* Each toy costs $29.

To find the total cost of the two toys, we need to multiply the cost of one toy by the number of toys Lucas bought.

Total cost = Cost of one toy × Number of toys
Total cost = $29 × 2

To find the total amount of money Marie has now, we need to add all these amounts together:

$19 (saved from allowance) + $32 (birthday gift from grandma) + $14 (earned from mowing lawn) = $19 + $32 + $14

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Marie had before paying her friend:

$19 (saved from allowance) + $32 (birthday gift from grandma) + $14 (earned from mowing lawn) = $19 + $32 + $14

Now, we need to subtract the amount she needs to pay back her friend:

$65 (total money before paying back) - $32 (amount to pay back to her friend) = $65 - $32

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the problem with the new information:
* Luke finds one dollar in his pocket
* Luke's dad gives him $27

We will calculate the total money Luke has before buying the toy car.

Money in Luke's pocket: $1
Money given by Luke's dad: $27

Total money Luke has = Money in pocket + Money from dad
Total money Luke has = $1 + $27
Total money Luke has = $28

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Linda initially has 29 quarters in her piggy bank.

2. She uses 12 quarters to buy a small toy.
   * Remaining quarters after buying the toy = 29 - 12 = 17 quarters

3. Later that day, her mother gives her an additional 9 quarters.
   * Quarters added by her mother = 9

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters Linda has:
   * Total quarters = Remaining quarters after buying the toy + Quarters added by her mother
   * Total quarters = 17 + 9 = 26 quarters

Therefore, Linda now has 26 quarters.

2. She uses 12 quarters to buy a small toy.
   * Remaining quarters after buying the toy = 29 - 12 = 17 quarters

3. Later that day, her mother gives her an additional 9 quarters.
   * Quarters added by her mother = 9
   * Total quarters after her mother's addition = 17 + 9 = 26 quarters

4. Then, her father gives her 25 more quarters.
   * Quarters added by her father = 25

5. Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters Linda has:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Linda initially thought she had 29 quarters in her piggy bank.

2. However, she miscounted and actually had 12 less than she initially thought.
   * Actual number of quarters = Initial count - 12
   * Actual number of quarters = 29 - 12 = 17 quarters

3. Then, her dad gives her 80 quarters.
   * Quarters added by her dad = 80

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters Linda has:
   * Total quarters = Actual number of quarters + Quarters added by her dad
   * Total quarters = 17 + 80 = 97 quarters

Therefore, Linda now has 97 quarters.

* Marcos had $61 in his piggy bank initially.
* He found $3 under his bed and added it to his piggy bank.

To find out how much money Marcos has now in his piggy bank, we need to add the amount he found to the amount he already had.

$61 (initial amount) + $3 (amount found) = $64

Therefore, Marcos now has $64 in his piggy bank.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We know that:
* Marcos had $61 in his piggy bank initially.
* He found $3 under his bed and added it to his piggy bank, making it $64.
* He won $30 from a school contest and wants to add it to his piggy bank.

To find the total amount of money Marcos will have in his piggy bank after adding the contest money, we need to add the $30 to the current amount in his piggy bank.

Current amount in piggy bank: $64
Contest money: $30

$64 (current amount) + $30 (contest money) = $94

So, after adding the contest money, Marcos will have a total of $94 in his piggy bank.

* He found $3 under his bed and added it to his piggy bank.

To find out how much money Marcos would have had in his piggy bank in this case, we need to add the amount he found to the updated initial amount.

$67 (updated initial amount) + $3 (amount found) = $70

Therefore, if Marcos initially had $67 in his piggy bank and added the $3 he found, he would have had $70 in his piggy bank.

2. First, let's calculate how many quarters are left after buying the book:

   * Quarters left after buying the book = 62 - 9
   * Quarters left after buying the book = &lt;&lt;62-9=53&gt;&gt;53

3. Now, let's calculate how many quarters are left after buying the stationary items:
   * Quarters left after buying stationary = Quarters left after buying the book - Quarters spent on stationary

    <pre class="model-raw-response">I apologize for the confusion in the previous problem. Let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Lucy had 43 quarters in her piggy bank before going to the book fair.
   * She used 15 quarters to buy a toy.

2. To find out how many quarters Lucy has left, we need to subtract the number of quarters she used from the total number of quarters she had initially:
   * Quarters left = Total quarters - Quarters used
   * Quarters left = 43 - 15
   * Quarters left = &lt;&lt;43-15=28&gt;&gt;28

Therefore, Lucy has 28 quarters left in her piggy bank after buying the toy at the book fair.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Marcus has $47 in his savings account.
* He earns $29 by mowing his neighbor's lawn.
* He adds the $29 to his savings account.

To find the total amount of money Marcus has now, we need to add the money he had initially in his savings account to the money he earned from mowing the lawn.

Total money = Initial savings + Money earned from mowing the lawn
Total money = $47 + $29
Total money = $47 + $29 = $76

Therefore, Marcus now has a total of $76 in his savings account.

### Answer: $76</pre>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue with the problem. We know that:
* Marcus had $76 in his savings account.
* He wants to buy a video game that costs $41.

To find out how much money Marcus will have left in his savings account after buying the video game, we need to subtract the cost of the video game from his current savings.

Money left = Current savings - Cost of the video game
Money left = $76 - $41
Money left = $76 - $41 = $35

So, after buying the video game, Marcus will have $35 left in his savings account.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information we have:
* Marcus has $4 in his savings account (instead of $47).
* He earns $29 by mowing his neighbor's lawn.
* He adds the $29 to his savings account.

To find the total amount of money Marcus has now, we need to add the money he had initially in his savings account to the money he earned from mowing the lawn.

Total money = Initial savings + Money earned from mowing the lawn
Total money = $4 + $29
Total money = $4 + $29 = $33

Therefore, with the updated initial savings of $4, Marcus would have a total of $33 in his savings account after receiving the extra $29 from mowing his neighbor's lawn.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information and solve the problem step by step:

1. Ryan initially has 9 quarters in his piggy bank.
2. He spends 3 quarters on a pencil, so he has 9 - 3 = 6 quarters left.
3. After his sister gives him some pennies, he has a total of 35 quarters worth of coins.

To find out how many quarters' worth of pennies Ryan's sister gave him, we need to:
1. Calculate the value of the quarters Ryan has after buying the pencil.
2. Subtract that value from the total value of coins he has after receiving the pennies.

Calculation:
* Ryan has 6 quarters left after buying the pencil.
* The total value of coins after receiving the pennies is equivalent to 35 quarters.
* Quarters' worth of pennies = Total value after pennies - Value of remaining quarters
* Quarters' worth of pennies = 35 - 6 = 29

Therefore, Ryan's sister gave him pennies worth 29 quarters.

2. Calculate the remaining money after buying the ice cream bar:
   * Remaining money after ice cream = Initial savings - Money spent on ice cream
   * Remaining money after ice cream = $92 - $3
   * Remaining money after ice cream = $89

3. Calculate the remaining money after buying the board game:
   * Remaining money after board game = Remaining money after ice cream - Money spent on board game
   * Remaining money after board game = $89 - $62
   * Remaining money after board game = $27

Therefore, Martin should have $27 left in his savings now.

Given:
- Debbie finds 31 pennies on the street.
- Later that day, she finds 27 more pennies.

Step 1: Add the number of pennies Debbie found on the street to the number of pennies she found later that day.
Total pennies = Pennies found on the street + Pennies found later
Total pennies = 31 + 27
Total pennies = 58

Therefore, Debbie has a total of 58 pennies.

* She wants to buy a book that costs $17.

To find out how much money Lori will have left after buying the book, we need to subtract the cost of the book from her total savings.

Money left = Total savings - Cost of the book

To find out how many quarters Samantha will have left after buying the toy, we need to subtract the cost of the toy from her total savings.

Total quarters = 85
Cost of the toy = 34
Remaining quarters = Total quarters - Cost of the toy
Remaining quarters = 85 - 34 = &lt;&lt;85-34=51&gt;&gt;51

Initial quarters = 38
Birthday quarters = 37
Total quarters = Initial quarters + Birthday quarters
Total quarters = 38 + 37 = &lt;&lt;38+37=75&gt;&gt;75

Now, let's calculate how much money Mike will have left if he buys the marbles after purchasing the lego set:

Money left after buying marbles = Money left after buying lego set - Cost of marbles

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Emily has 37 quarters in her piggy bank.
   * She uses 22 quarters to buy a toy.

2. To find out how many quarters Emily will have left, we need to subtract the number of quarters she uses from the total number of quarters she has:
   * Quarters left = Total quarters - Quarters used
   * Quarters left = 37 - 22
   * Quarters left = 15

Therefore, after buying the toy, Emily will have 15 quarters left in her piggy bank.

### Answer: 15</pre>

   * Quarters left = Total quarters - Quarters used
   * Quarters left = 37 - 22
   * Quarters left = 15

3. Now, if Emily doubles the amount of quarters left:
   * Doubled quarters = Quarters left × 2
   * Doubled quarters = 15 × 2
   * Doubled quarters = 30

Therefore, after buying the toy, Emily will have 15 quarters left in her piggy bank. If she doubles that amount, she will have 30 quarters.

        Let's consider the previous scenario where Emily had 37 quarters in her piggy bank. She decided to use 22 quarters to buy a toy. But what if Emily had originally only had 31 quarters in her piggy bank before buying the toy? How many quarters will she have left in her piggy bank after buying the toy with 22 quarters?

1. Understand the new given information:
   * Emily has 31 quarters in her piggy bank.
   * She uses 22 quarters to buy a toy.

2. To find out how many quarters Emily will have left, we need to subtract the number of quarters she uses from the total number of quarters she has:
   * Quarters left = Total quarters - Quarters used
   * Quarters left = 31 - 22
   * Quarters left = 9

Therefore, if Emily had originally only had 31 quarters in her piggy bank before buying the toy with 22 quarters, she will have 9 quarters left in her piggy bank after the purchase.

1. Understand the given information:
   * James gives the clerk a 30¢ piece.
   * The candy bar costs 22¢.

2. To find the change James should receive, we need to subtract the cost of the candy bar from the amount James gave to the clerk:
   * Change = Amount given - Cost of the candy bar
   * Change = 30¢ - 22¢
   * Change = 8¢

Therefore, James should receive 8¢ in change from the candy shop clerk.

* From the previous problem, James received 8¢ in change after buying a candy bar.
* Later that day, his mom gives him an extra 74¢ to spend at the toy machine.

To find the total amount of money James has now, we need to add the change he received from the candy shop and the money his mom gave him:

* Total money = Change from candy shop + Money from mom
* Total money = 8¢ + 74¢
* Total money = 82¢

So, James now has a total of 82¢.

- Sam received $74 for his birthday.

To find the total amount of money Sam has now, we need to add the money he has in his piggy bank to the birthday money he received.

Step 1: Add the money left in the piggy bank to the birthday money.
Total money = Money left in piggy bank + Birthday money
Total money = $24 + $74
Total money = $98

Therefore, after adding his birthday money to what was left in his piggy bank, Sam now has a total of $98.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. Understand the new given information:
   * Sam has $79 in his piggy bank.
   * The game he wants to buy still costs $26.

2. To find out how much money Sam will have left, we need to subtract the cost of the game from the amount he has in his piggy bank:
   * Money left = Money in piggy bank - Cost of the game
   * Money left = $79 - $26
   * Money left = $53

Therefore, after buying the game, Sam will now have $53 left in his piggy bank.

   * Remaining money after purchase = $87 - $85
   * Remaining money after purchase = $2

3. Add the gift money from his aunt to the remaining money:
   * Total money now = Remaining money after purchase + Gift money

Given:
- Patrick has $87 in his wallet.
- The book he wants to buy now costs $41.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining money after buying the book.
Remaining money = Money in wallet - Cost of the book
Remaining money = $87 - $41
Remaining money = $46

So, if the book Patrick bought cost $41, he would have $46 left in his wallet after making the purchase.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Tom initially has $50 in his wallet.

2. He spends $13 on lunch.
   * After spending $13, Tom has: $50 - $13 = $37

3. Later, his mom gives him $7 for helping with chores.
   * Tom now has: $37 + $7 = $44

Therefore, Tom currently has $44.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off in the previous problem.

Given:
- Tom had $44 after spending money on lunch and receiving money from his mom for chores.
- He found an additional $3 in his coat pocket.

To find out how much money Tom has now, we need to add the $3 he found to his current amount.

Tom's current money = $44 + $3 = $47

Therefore, after finding the additional $3 in his coat pocket, Tom now has a total of $47.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same steps as before, but with the updated initial amount of money Tom had in his wallet.

Given:
- Tom initially has $82 in his wallet.
- He spends $13 on lunch.
- His mom gives him $7 for helping with chores.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Tom has after spending $13 on lunch.
$82 - $13 = $69

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Tom has after receiving $7 from his mom.
$69 + $7 = $76

Therefore, if Tom initially had $82 in his wallet, after spending $13 on lunch and receiving $7 from his mom, he would have $76.

* John saves $76 from his part-time job
* His uncle gives him an additional $21 as a birthday gift

To find out how much money John has in total, we need to add the money he saved from his job and the money his uncle gave him.

Money saved from job: $76
Money received as birthday gift: $21

Total money = Money saved from job + Money received as birthday gift
Total money = $76 + $21 = $97

Therefore, John now has a total of $97.

* John saves $76 from his part-time job
* His uncle gives him an additional $21 as a birthday gift
* John buys a video game that costs $26

To find out how much money John has left after purchasing the video game, we need to:
1. Add the money he saved from his job and the money his uncle gave him to find the total money he had before buying the game.
2. Subtract the cost of the video game from the total money he had.

Step 1: Calculate the total money John had before buying the game
* Money saved from job: $76
* Money received as birthday gift: $21
* Total money before purchase = $76 + $21 = $97

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the video game from the total money
* Total money before purchase: $97
* Cost of the video game: $26
* Money left after purchase = $97 - $26 = $71

Therefore, John has $71 left after purchasing the video game.

To find out how much money John has in total, we need to add the money he saved from his job and the money his uncle gave him.

Money saved from job: $54
Money received as birthday gift: $21

Total money = Money saved from job + Money received as birthday gift
Total money = $54 + $21 = $75

Therefore, with the updated amount saved from his part-time job, John now has a total of $75.

Given:
- Alex originally had 21 dollar bills.
- In this scenario, he uses 4 dollar bills to buy the toy robot instead of 19.

To find out how many dollar bills Alex would have left after this purchase, we need to subtract the number of dollar bills he used from the total number of dollar bills he had:

Remaining dollar bills = Total dollar bills - Dollar bills used
Remaining dollar bills = 21 - 4
Remaining dollar bills = 17

Therefore, if Alex had used only 4 dollar bills to buy the toy robot, he would have 17 dollar bills left after the purchase.

        John's sister, Lucy, also had some money. She had $64. After John bought his video game, how much more money did Lucy have compared to John?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We know:

* John has $33 left after buying the video game.
* Lucy has $64.

To find out how much more money Lucy has compared to John, we need to subtract John's remaining money from Lucy's money:

Difference = Lucy's money - John's remaining money
Difference = $64 - $33
Difference = $31

So, Lucy has $31 more than John after he bought the video game.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's update the problem with the new information:

* John initially had $82 in his wallet.
* He spent $26 on a new video game.
* We need to find out how much money John has left after buying the video game.

To find the remaining money, we subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had:

Remaining money = Initial amount - Amount spent
Remaining money = $82 - $26
Remaining money = $56

So, after buying the video game for $26, John now has $56 left in his wallet.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Alex initially had $22
* His father gave him an additional $33

To find out how much money Alex has in total, we need to add the money he had initially and the money his father gave him.

Total money = Initial money + Money given by his father
Total money = $22 + $33
Total money = $55

Therefore, Alex has a total of $55.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Alex initially had $22
* His father gave him an additional $33
* After receiving money from his mother, Alex has a total of $84

To find out how much money Alex's mother gave him, we need to:
1. Calculate the total money Alex had before his mother gave him money
2. Subtract that amount from the total money he has after receiving money from his mother

Money before mother's contribution = Initial money + Money given by his father
Money before mother's contribution = $22 + $33 = $55

Now, let's calculate the money given by Alex's mother:
Money given by mother = Total money after mother's contribution - Money before mother's contribution
Money given by mother = $84 - $55 = $29

Therefore, Alex's mother gave him $29.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information based on the new scenario:
* Alex initially had $22

To find out how much money Alex has in total now, we need to add the money he had initially and the money his father gave him in this new scenario.

Total money = Initial money + Money given by his father
Total money = $22 + $17
Total money = $39

Therefore, in this new scenario, Alex has a total of $39.

1. Understand the given information:
   * George had 27 pennies in his pocket.
   * He found a jar at home with 72 pennies.

2. To find the total number of pennies George has now, we need to add the pennies in his pocket to the pennies he found in the jar.

3. Add the pennies:
   * Pennies in pocket = 27
   * Pennies in jar = 72
   * Total pennies = Pennies in pocket + Pennies in jar
   * Total pennies = 27 + 72 = &lt;&lt;27+72=99&gt;&gt;99

So, after adding the pennies from the jar to the pennies in his pocket, George now has 99 pennies.

   * He found a jar at home with 72 pennies.
   * He added the pennies from the jar to the pennies in his pocket.
   * He spent 25 pennies at the candy store.

2. Calculate the total number of pennies George had before going to the candy store:
   * Pennies in pocket = 27
   * Pennies in jar = 72
   * Total pennies before candy store = Pennies in pocket + Pennies in jar
   * Total pennies before candy store = 27 + 72 = &lt;&lt;27+72=99&gt;&gt;99

3. Subtract the number of pennies George spent at the candy store from the total pennies he had:
   * Pennies spent at candy store = 25
   * Pennies left = Total pennies before candy store - Pennies spent at candy store
   * Pennies left = 99 - 25 = &lt;&lt;99-25=74&gt;&gt;74

Now, let's calculate:

1. Total candles sold = Morning sales + Evening sales
   * Total candles sold = 58 + 27 = 85 candles

2. Total money earned before parking fee = Total candles sold × Price per candle

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Mason had 32 quarters left after spending some.
2. His brother borrowed 12 more quarters.
3. To find out how many quarters Mason has now, we need to subtract the borrowed quarters from the quarters he had:
   * Current quarters = Quarters after spending - Borrowed quarters

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We know that:
* After paying for her school project, Sara had 21 quarters left.
* Her brother gave her 23 more quarters.

To find out how many quarters Sara has now, we need to add the number of quarters her brother gave her to the number of quarters she had left after paying for the school project.

21 + 23 = 44

So, Sara now has a total of 44 quarters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information:
* Sara had a total of 58 quarters.
* She used 48 quarters for a school project.

To find out how many quarters Sara is left with, we subtract the number of quarters she used from the total number of quarters she had.

58 - 48 = 10

In this situation, Sara would have 10 quarters left after contributing to the school project.

To find the total number of quarters Lucy has now, we need to add the quarters she already had to the quarters she received as gifts.

Initial quarters in the piggy bank = 20
Quarters received as gifts = 63
Total quarters = Initial quarters + Gift quarters
Total quarters = 20 + 63 = &lt;&lt;20+63=83&gt;&gt;83

To find out how many quarters Lucy will have left after buying the toy, we need to subtract the cost of the toy from the total number of quarters she has.

Total quarters before purchase = 83
Cost of the stuffed animal toy = 53
Remaining quarters = Total quarters - Cost of the toy
Remaining quarters = 83 - 53 = &lt;&lt;83-53=30&gt;&gt;30

So, after buying the stuffed animal toy, Lucy will have 30 quarters left in her piggy bank.

Initial quarters in the piggy bank = 20
Quarters received as gifts = 74
Total quarters = Initial quarters + Gift quarters

To find out how many quarters Marco has left, we need to subtract the number of quarters he used from the total number of quarters he had:

Quarters left = Total quarters - Quarters used
Quarters left = 32 - 10

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off in the previous problem.

Given:
- Lucas had 20 pennies in his piggy bank after his mom took away 76 pennies.
- The next day, his grandma doubles the amount of pennies in his piggy bank.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pennies Lucas's grandma adds to his piggy bank.
Pennies added by grandma = Number of pennies in the piggy bank = 20

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pennies in Lucas's piggy bank after his grandma adds her pennies.
Total pennies = Pennies in the piggy bank + Pennies added by grandma
Total pennies = 20 + 20 = &lt;&lt;20+20=40&gt;&gt;40

Therefore, after his grandma doubles the amount of pennies, Lucas now has 40 pennies in his piggy bank.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Miguel has 27 quarters in his piggy bank.
* His older brother gives him 45 more quarters.

To find the total number of quarters Miguel has, we need to add the quarters he already has in his piggy bank to the quarters his brother gave him.

Total quarters = Quarters in piggy bank + Quarters given by his brother
Total quarters = 27 + 45 = &lt;&lt;27+45=72&gt;&gt;72

Therefore, Miguel has a total of 72 quarters.

To find the total number of quarters Miguel has now, we need to add all the quarters together.

Total quarters = Quarters in piggy bank + Quarters given by his brother + Quarters found under the bed
Total quarters = 27 + 45 + 17 = &lt;&lt;27+45+17=89&gt;&gt;89

* The video game he wants to buy costs $79.

To find out how much money Aiden will have left after buying the video game, we need to subtract the cost of the video game from the total money he has.

Money left = Total money - Cost of the video game
Money left = $88 - $79
Money left = $9

So, after buying the video game, Aiden will have $9 left.

   * Ryan gives the remaining $67 to his mom.

3. Ryan's mom gives him back the $67, and he spends $64 on a new video game.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Jacob saved $68 from his allowance.
* He received $30 from his godmother for his birthday.
* After his birthday, he bought a video game that cost $70.

First, let's calculate how much money Jacob had in total after receiving the birthday present:
* Total money before buying the video game = Money saved + Birthday present money
* Total money before buying the video game = $68 + $30 = $98

Now, let's calculate how much money Jacob has left after buying the video game:
* Money left = Total money before buying the video game - Cost of the video game
* Money left = $98 - $70 = $28

Therefore, Jacob has $28 left after buying the video game.

        Instead of receiving $30 from his godmother for his birthday, let's say Jacob only received $10. If he originally had saved $68 from his allowance, how much money would Jacob have in total after his birthday?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information:
* Jacob has already saved $68 from his allowance.
* His godmother gives him $10 as a birthday present.

To find out how much money Jacob has in total after his birthday, we need to add the money he already had to the money he received as a birthday present.

Total money = Money already saved + Birthday present money
Total money = $68 + $10
Total money = $78

Therefore, if Jacob originally had saved $68 from his allowance and received $10 from his godmother for his birthday, he would have a total of $78 after his birthday.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Ella has 20 one-dollar bills in her piggy bank from her birthday.
* Her aunt gives her 45 one-dollar bills as a Christmas gift.

To find the total amount of money in Ella's piggy bank, we need to add the number of one-dollar bills from her birthday and Christmas gift.

Birthday money: 20 one-dollar bills
Christmas gift money: 45 one-dollar bills

Total money = Birthday money + Christmas gift money
Total money = 20 + 45 = &lt;&lt;20+45=65&gt;&gt;65 one-dollar bills

Since each bill is worth one dollar, Ella has a total of $65 in her piggy bank.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's use the information from the previous problem and the new information given:
* Ella has a total of $65 in her piggy bank (from her birthday and Christmas money).
* She plans to spend $94 on a new bike.

To find out how much more money Ella needs to buy her new bike, we need to subtract the money she has from the cost of the bike.

Money needed = Cost of the bike - Money in her piggy bank
Money needed = $94 - $65 = &lt;&lt;94-65=29&gt;&gt;$29

Therefore, Ella needs $29 more to buy her new bike.

Given:
- Rob found 25 quarters under his bed.
- Rob found 6 quarters in his coat pocket.
- Rob had put 19 quarters in a jar on his desk.

From the previous question, we know that:
- The total number of quarters found under the bed and in the coat pocket is 31.

Now, let's calculate the new total including the quarters in the jar:
New total quarters = Previous total quarters + Quarters in the jar
New total quarters = 31 + 19 = 50

Given:
- Rob found 32 quarters under his bed.
- Rob found 6 quarters in his coat pocket.

To calculate the total number of quarters in this new scenario:
Total quarters = Quarters under the bed + Quarters in the coat pocket
Total quarters = 32 + 6 = 38

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue with the problem. We know that:
* Stacy has a total of $78 in her piggy bank.
* She decides to buy a toy horse for $47.

To find out how much money Stacy will have left after buying the toy, we need to subtract the cost of the toy from the total money she has.

Money left = Total money - Cost of the toy
Money left = $78 - $47
Money left = $31

So, after buying the toy horse, Stacy will have $31 left in her piggy bank.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information:
* Stacy initially has $76 in her piggy bank.
* Her father gives her an additional $5 for cleaning the house.

We will use the same method as before to find the total amount of money Stacy has now.

Total money = Initial money + Money given by her father
Total money = $76 + $5
Total money = $81

Therefore, if Stacy originally had $76 in her piggy bank and her father added $5, she would have a total of $81 in her piggy bank.

- They want to take out 2 quarters to buy a toy from the vending machine.

Step 1: Subtract the number of quarters they will use to buy the toy from the total number of quarters they have.
Remaining quarters = Total quarters - Quarters used to buy the toy
Remaining quarters = 99 - 2
Remaining quarters = &lt;&lt;99-2=97&gt;&gt;97

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information and find the solution step by step:

* John has $50 in his savings account.
* He wants to buy a game that costs $36.

To find out how much money will be left in his savings account after buying the game, we need to subtract the cost of the game from the total amount in his savings account.

$50 - $36 = $14

Therefore, after buying the game, John will have $14 left in his savings account.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* John has $50 in his savings account.
* He buys a game that costs $36.
* He wants to have $82 in his account.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the remaining amount in John's account after buying the game:
   * Remaining amount = $50 - $36 = $14

2. Calculate the additional amount John needs to save to have $82 in his account:
   * Additional amount needed = $82 - $14 = $68

So, John needs to save $68 more to have $82 in his account after buying the game.

* Liam has saved $72 from his summer job.
* The video game he wants to buy costs $41.
* Liam hands over all $72 to the cashier.

To find out how much change Liam should get back, we need to subtract the cost of the video game from the amount he gave to the cashier.

Change = Amount given - Cost of the video game
Change = $72 - $41
Change = $31

Therefore, Liam should get $31 back in change from the cashier.

* Liam has saved $72 from his summer job.
* The video game he buys costs $41.
* Liam gets some change back after paying for the video game.
* Liam's brother gives him an amount equal to the change he got from the video game purchase.

To find out how much money Liam has now, we need to:
1. Calculate the change Liam got back from the video game purchase.
2. Add the change to the amount his brother gave him (which is equal to the change).
3. Add the result to the remaining money Liam had after buying the video game.

Step 1: Calculate the change
* Change = Amount given - Cost of the video game
* Change = $72 - $41 = $31

Step 2: Add the change to the amount his brother gave him
* Amount from his brother = Change = $31
* Total amount received = Change + Amount from his brother
* Total amount received = $31 + $31 = $62

Step 3: Add the result to the remaining money Liam had after buying the video game
* Remaining money = Amount saved - Cost of the video game
* Remaining money = $72 - $41 = $31
* Total money Liam has now = Remaining money + Total amount received

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Leo saved a total of $94 from his allowance.
* He wants to buy a video game that costs $36.

To find out how much money Leo will have left after buying the video game, we need to subtract the cost of the video game from his total savings.

Calculation:
* Money left = Total savings - Cost of the video game
* Money left = $94 - $36
* Money left = $58

Therefore, after buying the video game, Leo will have $58 left from his allowance.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's update the information we have:
* Leo saved a total of $94 from his allowance.
* He bought a video game that costs $36.
* After buying the video game, he had $58 left.
* Now, he wants to buy a controller that costs $51.

To find out how much money Leo will have left after buying both the video game and the controller, we need to subtract the cost of the controller from the remaining money after buying the video game.

Calculation:
* Money left after buying the video game = $58
* Money left after buying the controller = $58 - $51
* Money left after buying the controller = $7

Therefore, after purchasing both the video game and the controller, Leo will have $7 left from his saved allowance.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the problem with the new information:
* Leo saved a total of $94 from his allowance.
* He decides to buy a comic book that costs $4 instead of the video game.

To find out how much money Leo will have left after buying the comic book, we need to subtract the cost of the comic book from his total savings.

Calculation:
* Money left = Total savings - Cost of the comic book
* Money left = $94 - $4
* Money left = $90

Therefore, after buying the comic book for $4, Leo will have $90 left from his allowance.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the information from the previous question to find out how many quarters Liam has now.

Given:
- Liam initially saved up 72 quarters.
- He spent 44 quarters on a different game.
- Liam found a stash of quarters equal to the amount he had left after buying the first game.

Step 1: Calculate the number of quarters Liam had left after buying the first game.
Quarters left after first game = Total quarters saved - Quarters spent
Quarters left after first game = 72 - 44 = 28

Step 2: Calculate the total number of quarters Liam has now.
Total quarters now = Quarters left after first game + Quarters found in the stash
Total quarters now = 28 + 28 = 56

Therefore, Liam now has a total of 56 quarters.

To find the total amount of money Sam has after receiving the gift, we need to add the money he had initially and the money he received from his aunt.

Total money = Initial money + Gift money
Total money = $31 + $55
Total money = $86

First, let's calculate the total number of pennies Mike currently has:
* Total pennies Mike has = Pennies in piggy bank + Pennies found under the bed
* Total pennies Mike has = 28 + 45 = &lt;&lt;28+45=73&gt;&gt;73

Now, to find out how many more pennies Mike needs, we subtract the total pennies he has from the number of pennies needed to purchase the comic book:
* Additional pennies needed = Pennies needed for comic book - Total pennies Mike has

        Lucas has $67 in his savings jar. On his birthday, his aunt gives him $9 as a gift. After Lucas adds the gift from his aunt to his savings jar, how much more money does he need to add to reach a total of $88?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Lucas has $67 in his savings jar.
* His aunt gives him $9 as a birthday gift.
* Lucas wants to reach a total of $88 in his savings jar.

First, let's calculate how much money Lucas has after adding the gift from his aunt:
$67 (savings) + $9 (gift) = $76

Now, to find out how much more money Lucas needs to add to reach $88, we subtract the current total from the desired total:
$88 (desired total) - $76 (current total) = $12

Therefore, Lucas needs to add $12 more to his savings jar to reach a total of $88.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the updated information:
* Lucas originally had $67 in his savings jar.
* His grandparents gave him an early Christmas gift of $24.

To find out how much money Lucas has in total in his savings jar after adding his grandparents' gift, we need to add the original amount in his savings jar and the gift from his grandparents.

$67 (original savings) + $24 (grandparents' gift) = $91

Therefore, after adding his grandparents' early Christmas gift to his savings jar, Lucas now has a total of $91 in his savings jar.

* Sam initially has $54
* She finds a $1 coin on the sidewalk
* Someone gives her $17 as a birthday present

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Add the $1 coin to Sam's initial amount:
   * $54 + $1 = $55

2. Add the $17 birthday present to the amount from step 1:
   * $55 + $17 = $72

Therefore, after receiving the $17 birthday present and finding the $1 coin, Sam has a total of $72.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much total money James spent at The Money Store, we need to add the amount he spent on books and the amount he spent on shoes.

Given:
- James spent $19 on books.
- James spent $57 on a new pair of shoes.

To calculate the total amount James spent, we add the two amounts:

Total spent = Money spent on books + Money spent on shoes
Total spent = $19 + $57
Total spent = $76

Therefore, James spent a total of $76 at The Money Store.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
- James had $80 with him when he went to the store.
- He spent $19 on books and $57 on a new pair of shoes.

To find out how much money James had left, we need to subtract the total amount he spent from the amount he had initially.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount James spent.
Total spent = Money spent on books + Money spent on shoes
Total spent = $19 + $57 = $76

Step 2: Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount James had.
Money left = Initial amount - Total spent
Money left = $80 - $76 = $4

Therefore, James had $4 left after spending $19 on books and $57 on a new pair of shoes.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's update the problem with the new information:
- James spent $28 on a magazine instead of $19 on books.
- James still spent $57 on a new pair of shoes.

To calculate the total amount James spent this time, we add the cost of the magazine and the cost of the shoes:

Total spent = Money spent on magazine + Money spent on shoes
Total spent = $28 + $57
Total spent = $85

Therefore, with the updated purchase of a magazine instead of books, James spent a total of $85 at The Money Store.

To find the total amount of money Devin has after his birthday, we need to add the money he had saved and the money he received from his aunt.

Money saved before birthday: $60

To find out how much money Devin would have left after buying the book, we need to subtract the cost of the book from his total money.

Money after birthday: $86
Cost of the book: $9

Money left after buying the book = Money after birthday - Cost of the book

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information and find the solution step by step:

* Liam has saved $54 from doing chores.
* The video game he wants to buy costs $29.
* We need to find out how much money Liam will have left if he buys the game.

Now, let's calculate:
* Money left = Money saved - Cost of the game
* Money left = $54 - $29
* Money left = $25

Therefore, if Liam decides to buy the video game, he will have $25 left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given:
* Liam has now saved $81 from doing chores.
* The video game he wants to buy still costs $29.
* We need to find out how much money Liam will have left if he buys the game.

Calculation:
* Money left = Money saved - Cost of the game
* Money left = $81 - $29
* Money left = $52

Therefore, if Liam decides to buy the video game, he will have $52 left.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jessica has 69 quarters in her piggy bank.
   * She used 18 quarters for her school's snack machine.

2. To find out how many quarters Jessica has remaining, we need to subtract the number of quarters she used from the total number of quarters she had initially.

3. Calculation:
   * Remaining quarters = Initial quarters - Used quarters

        Jessica's best friend Hannah also has a piggy bank. Jessica has 69 quarters and uses 18 quarters for her school's snack machine. Hannah already has 41 quarters in her piggy bank. If Jessica adds her remaining quarters to Hannah's quarters, how many quarters do they have combined?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll first find out how many quarters Jessica has left after using some for the snack machine, and then we'll add that number to Hannah's quarters.

Given:
- Jessica has 69 quarters initially.
- Jessica uses 18 quarters for the snack machine.
- Hannah has 41 quarters in her piggy bank.

Step 1: Calculate the number of quarters Jessica has remaining after using 18 for the snack machine.
Jessica's remaining quarters = Initial quarters - Used quarters
Jessica's remaining quarters = 69 - 18 = 51

Step 2: Add Jessica's remaining quarters to Hannah's quarters to find the total number of quarters they have combined.
Combined quarters = Jessica's remaining quarters + Hannah's quarters
Combined quarters = 51 + 41 = 92

Therefore, Jessica and Hannah have a total of 92 quarters combined.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the updated information:
   * Jessica actually had 39 quarters in her piggy bank, not 69.
   * She used 18 quarters for her school's snack machine.

2. To find out how many quarters Jessica has remaining, we need to subtract the number of quarters she used from the actual number of quarters she had initially.

3. Calculation:
   * Remaining quarters = Actual initial quarters - Used quarters
   * Remaining quarters = 39 - 18

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tom had 63 quarters saved up initially.
   * He bought a toy car that cost 50 quarters.
   * He wants to buy a toy spaceship that costs 77 quarters.

2. Calculate how many quarters Tom had left after buying the toy car:
   * Remaining quarters after buying the car = Total quarters - Cost of the toy car
   * Remaining quarters after buying the car = 63 - 50
   * Remaining quarters after buying the car = 13

3. Calculate how many more quarters Tom needs to buy the toy spaceship:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, using the new information you provided.

Given:
- Tom had 63 quarters saved up initially.
- The toy car now costs 7 quarters.

To find out how many quarters Tom would have left after buying the toy car, we need to subtract the cost of the toy car from his initial savings.

Remaining quarters = Initial savings - Cost of the toy car
Remaining quarters = 63 - 7
Remaining quarters = 56

So, if Tom spent 7 quarters from his initial saving of 63 quarters on the toy car, he would have 56 quarters left.
