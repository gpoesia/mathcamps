            Math problem: Determine the value of the sum when adding (74 / 63) and (91 / 78).
        </p>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of (74 / 63) and (91 / 78), we need to add these two fractions. To do this, we first need to find a common denominator.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 63 and 78.
LCM(63, 78) = 2 Ã— 3Â² Ã— 13 = 234

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 234.
(74 / 63) = (74 Ã— 78) / (63 Ã— 78) = (5772 / 4914) = (1924 / 1638)
(91 / 78) = (91 Ã— 63) / (78 Ã— 63) = (5733 / 4914) = (1911 / 1638)

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions and keep the common denominator.
(1924 / 1638) + (1911 / 1638) = (1924 + 1911) / 1638 = 3835 / 1638

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
3835 and 1638 have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the sum of (74 / 63) and (91 / 78) is (3835 / 1638).

Step 1: Add (3835 / 1638) to itself.
(3835 / 1638) + (3835 / 1638) = (3835 Ã— 2) / 1638 = 7670 / 1638

Step 2: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
7670 and 1638 have a common factor of 2.
(7670 / 1638) = (3835 / 819)

Therefore, the sum of (3835 / 1638) and itself is (3835 / 819).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's follow the same steps as before to find the sum of (35 / 63) and (91 / 78).

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 63 and 78.
LCM(63, 78) = 2 Ã— 3Â² Ã— 13 = 234

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 234.
(35 / 63) = (35 Ã— 78) / (63 Ã— 78) = (2730 / 4914) = (910 / 1638)
(91 / 78) = (91 Ã— 63) / (78 Ã— 63) = (5733 / 4914) = (1911 / 1638)

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions and keep the common denominator.
(910 / 1638) + (1911 / 1638) = (910 + 1911) / 1638 = 2821 / 1638

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
2821 and 1638 have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the sum of (35 / 63) and (91 / 78) is (2821 / 1638).

            Imagine you originally had 22/34 of a basket of ripe apples instead of 22/49, and you also have 72/35 of a basket of oranges. How much do you have in total, given these new amounts? Provide your answer in simplified form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step. We need to add 22/34 (the new fraction of apples) and 72/35 (the fraction of oranges).

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 34 and 35.

LCM(34, 35) = 1190

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

22/34 = (22 Ã— 35) / (34 Ã— 35) = 770/1190
72/35 = (72 Ã— 34) / (35 Ã— 34) = 2448/1190

Add the numerators and keep the common denominator:

770/1190 + 2448/1190 = (770 + 2448)/1190 = 3218/1190

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF):

GCF(3218, 1190) = 34

3218/1190 = (3218 Ã· 34) / (1190 Ã· 34) = 94/35

Therefore, the total amount of apples and oranges is 94/35 of a basket.

18/21 = (18 Ã— 79) / 1659 = 1422/1659

Adding the fractions:

n = 2451/1659

Now, we need to add 71/97 to n.

To add these fractions, we need to find the common denominator, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 1659 and 97.

LCM(1659, 97) = 1659 Ã— 97 (since 1659 and 97 are coprime)
LCM(1659, 97) = 160923

Converting the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

n = 2451/1659 = (2451 Ã— 97) / 160923 = 237747/160923
71/97 = (71 Ã— 1659) / 160923 = 117789/160923

Adding the fractions:
237747/160923 + 117789/160923 = (237747 + 117789) / 160923 = 355536/160923

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

49/3 = (49 Ã— 7) / 21 = 343/21
18/21 = 18/21 (already has the common denominator)

Adding the fractions:

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 2961.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 86/62 and 99/41, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 62 and 41.

62 = 2 Ã— 31
41 is a prime number

LCM(62, 41) = 2 Ã— 31 Ã— 41 = 2542

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

86/62 = (86 Ã— 41) / (62 Ã— 41) = 3526/2542
99/41 = (99 Ã— 62) / (41 Ã— 62) = 6138/2542

Adding the fractions:

3526/2542 + 6138/2542 = (3526 + 6138) / 2542 = 9664/2542

Simplifying the result:

9664/2542 = 4832/1271 = 3.8/1 = 3.8

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate ((68 / 33) + (70 / 25)), let's simplify each fraction and then add them together.

1. Simplify 68 / 33:
   68 / 33 = 2 2/33
   Simplify 2/33 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 1.
   2/33 cannot be simplified further.
   So, 68 / 33 = 2 2/33

2. Simplify 70 / 25:
   70 / 25 = 2 20/25
   Simplify 20/25 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 5.
   20/25 Ã· 5/5 = 4/5
   So, 70 / 25 = 2 4/5

3. Add the simplified fractions:
   2 2/33 + 2 4/5 = 2 2/33 + 2 20/33
                  = 4 22/33

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 97 and 9.
LCM(97, 9) = 873 (since 97 Ã— 9 = 873)

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 873.
35/97 = (35 Ã— 9)/(97 Ã— 9) = 315/873
11/9 = (11 Ã— 97)/(9 Ã— 97) = 1067/873

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the common denominator.
315/873 + 1067/873 = (315 + 1067)/873 = 1382/873

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
GCF(1382, 873) = 1 (since 1382 and 873 are relatively prime)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's continue from the previous answer, where we found that the summation of 35/97 and 11/9 is 1382/873.

Now, we need to add 11/25 to 1382/873.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 873 and 25.
LCM(873, 25) = 21825 (since 873 Ã— 25 = 21825)

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 21825.
1382/873 = (1382 Ã— 25)/(873 Ã— 25) = 34550/21825
11/25 = (11 Ã— 873)/(25 Ã— 873) = 9603/21825

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the common denominator.
34550/21825 + 9603/21825 = (34550 + 9603)/21825 = 44153/21825

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
GCF(44153, 21825) = 1 (since 44153 and 21825 are relatively prime)

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1455.
35/97 = (35 Ã— 15)/(97 Ã— 15) = 525/1455
11/15 = (11 Ã— 97)/(15 Ã— 97) = 1067/1455

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the common denominator.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract 79/70 from 11/5, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 70 and 5 is 70. So, we will convert 11/5 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 70.

11/5 = (11 Ã— 14) / (5 Ã— 14) = 154/70

Now we can subtract:

154/70 - 79/70 = (154 - 79) / 70 = 75/70

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 5:

75/70 = (75 Ã· 5) / (70 Ã· 5) = 15/14

Now, we need to add 62/46 to 15/14.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 14 and 46 is 322.

15/14 = (15 Ã— 23) / (14 Ã— 23) = 345/322
62/46 = (62 Ã— 7) / (46 Ã— 7) = 434/322

Now we can add:

345/322 + 434/322 = (345 + 434) / 322 = 779/322

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 19:

61/5 = (61 Ã— 14) / (5 Ã— 14) = 854/70

Now we can subtract:

854/70 - 79/70 = (854 - 79) / 70 = 775/70

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 5:

LCM(16, 78) = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 13 = 624

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 624.
68/16 = 68 Ã— (624/16) / (624/16) = 2652/624
52/78 = 52 Ã— (624/78) / (624/78) = 416/624

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
2652/624 + 416/624 = (2652 + 416)/624 = 3068/624

From the previous calculation, we found that 21/75 + 44/47 = 4287/3525.

So, (21/75 + 44/47) + (21/75 + 44/47) = 2 Ã— (4287/3525)

Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2:
2 Ã— (4287/3525) = (2 Ã— 4287) / 3525 = 8574/3525

Simplifying the result:
8574/3525 cannot be simplified further as the GCD(8574, 3525) = 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's follow the same steps as before, but with 21/63 instead of 21/75.

First, find the common denominator by calculating the LCM of 63 and 47.

LCM(63, 47) = 2961

Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

21/63 = (21 Ã— 47) / (63 Ã— 47) = 987/2961
44/47 = (44 Ã— 63) / (47 Ã— 63) = 2772/2961

Add the fractions:
987/2961 + 2772/2961 = (987 + 2772)/2961 = 3759/2961

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 60/48 and 37/47, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 48 and 47.

LCM(48, 47) = 48 Ã— 47 = 2256 (since 48 and 47 are coprime)

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

60/48 = 60 Ã— (47/47) / 48 = 2820/2256
37/47 = 37 Ã— (48/48) / 47 = 1776/2256

Adding the fractions:

2820/2256 + 1776/2256 = (2820 + 1776)/2256 = 4596/2256

Simplifying the result:

4596/2256 = 2298/1128 = 1149/564

Now, we need to add 35/35 to 1149/564.

First, let's convert 35/35 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 564 (the same as the denominator of 1149/564):

35/35 = 35 Ã— (564/564) / 35 = 19740/19740

Adding 1149/564 and 19740/19740:

1149/564 + 19740/19740 = (1149 Ã— (19740/19740) + 19740 Ã— (564/564)) / 564
= (1149 Ã— 19740 + 19740 Ã— 564) / (564 Ã— 19740)
= (22690060 + 11133360) / 11133360
= 33823420 / 11133360

Simplifying the result:

33823420 / 11133360 = 3038/1000 = 1519/500

Therefore, if you add 35/35 to the sum of 60/48 and 37/47, you get 1519/500.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the sum of the new amount of apples (60/45 kg) and the amount of oranges (37/47 kg).

Step 1: Find a common denominator for 60/45 and 37/47.
The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 45 and 47.
LCM(45, 47) = 45 Ã— 47 = 2115 (since 45 and 47 are coprime)

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
60/45 = 60 Ã— (47/47) / 45 = 2820/2115
37/47 = 37 Ã— (45/45) / 47 = 1665/2115

Step 3: Add the fractions.
2820/2115 + 1665/2115 = (2820 + 1665)/2115 = 4485/2115

Step 4: Simplify the result.
4485/2115 cannot be simplified further as the numerator and denominator are coprime.

Therefore, the total weight of the apples and oranges Jane buys is 4485/2115 kilograms.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 95/57 and 28/80, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 57 and 80.

LCM(57, 80) = 2280 (since 57 = 3 Ã— 19 and 80 = 2^4 Ã— 5, the LCM is 2^4 Ã— 3 Ã— 5 Ã— 19 = 2280)

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

95/57 = (95 Ã— 40) / (57 Ã— 40) = 3800/2280
28/80 = (28 Ã— 28.5) / (80 Ã— 28.5) = 798/2280

Adding the fractions:
3800/2280 + 798/2280 = (3800 + 798) / 2280 = 4598/2280

Simplifying the result:
4598/2280 = 2299/1140

Therefore, the sum of 95/57 and 28/80 is 2299/1140.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To double the sum of 95/57 and 28/80, we can multiply the sum by 2.

From the previous answer, we found that the sum of 95/57 and 28/80 is 2299/1140.

Doubling the sum:
2 Ã— (2299/1140) = (2 Ã— 2299) / 1140 = 4598/1140

Simplifying the result:
4598/1140 = 2299/570

Therefore, if you double the sum of 95/57 and 28/80, you will get 2299/570.

            In the previous problem you considered the sum of 95/57 and 28/80, now consider what would happen if you changed the 57 in the denominator of the first fraction to a 21. What would be the new sum of 95/21 and 28/80?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's follow the same steps as before to find the sum of 95/21 and 28/80.

First, find the common denominator, which is the LCM of 21 and 80.
LCM(21, 80) = 840 (since 21 = 3 Ã— 7 and 80 = 2^4 Ã— 5, the LCM is 2^3 Ã— 3 Ã— 5 Ã— 7 = 840)

Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

95/21 = (95 Ã— 40) / (21 Ã— 40) = 3800/840
28/80 = (28 Ã— 10.5) / (80 Ã— 10.5) = 294/840

Add the fractions:
3800/840 + 294/840 = (3800 + 294) / 840 = 4094/840

Simplify the result:
4094/840 = 2047/420

Therefore, the sum of 95/21 and 28/80 is 2047/420.

LCM(57, 42) = 1197

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

14/57 = (14 Ã— 21) / (57 Ã— 21) = 294/1197
92/42 = (92 Ã— 57) / (42 Ã— 57) = 5244/1197

Adding the fractions:

294/1197 + 5244/1197 = (294 + 5244) / 1197 = 5538/1197

Simplifying the result:

5538/1197 = 4 + 341/1197 = 4 + (341 Ã· 31) / (1197 Ã· 31) = 4 + 11/38

Therefore, the sum of 14/57 and 92/42 is 4 11/38.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know from the previous calculation that ((77 / 55) + (6 / 5)) = 2.6

2. Now, we need to add 2.6 and 39/64.

3. To add a decimal and a fraction, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal or the decimal to a fraction. Let's convert 39/64 to a decimal:
   39 Ã· 64 â‰ˆ 0.609375

4. Now we can add 2.6 and 0.609375:
   2.6 + 0.609375 = 3.209375

5. If we want the result as a fraction, we can convert 3.209375 to a fraction:
   3.209375 = 3 + 0.209375
   0.209375 Ã— 64 â‰ˆ 13.4
   13.4/64 â‰ˆ 13/64

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the result of (77 / 55) + (6 / 79).

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of 55 and 79.
LCD = 55 Ã— 79 = 4345

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
77 / 55 = (77 Ã— 79) / 4345 = 6083 / 4345
6 / 79 = (6 Ã— 55) / 4345 = 330 / 4345

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
(6083 / 4345) + (330 / 4345) = (6083 + 330) / 4345 = 6413 / 4345

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
6413 and 4345 have a common factor of 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, (77 / 55) + (6 / 79) = 6413 / 4345.

Now, we need to subtract 7/44 from 3871/1940.

First, let's find the common denominator of 1940 and 44.

LCM(1940, 44) = 1940

7/44 = 7 Ã— 1940/44 Ã— 1940 = 13580/85360

Now, we can subtract:

13580/85360 remains as it is.

Subtracting the fractions:

170324/85360 - 13580/85360 = (170324 - 13580)/85360 = 156744/85360

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of 54/88 and 28/10, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 88 and 10 is 440.

54/88 = (54 * 5) / (88 * 5) = 270 / 440
28/10 = (28 * 44) / (10 * 44) = 1232 / 440

Now we can add the fractions:

270/440 + 1232/440 = (270 + 1232) / 440 = 1502 / 440

Simplifying the fraction:
1502 / 440 = 751 / 220

Therefore, the sum of 54/88 and 28/10 is 751/220.

First, we need to find a common denominator between 751/220 and 21/13. The least common multiple of 220 and 13 is 2860.

751/220 = (751 * 13) / (220 * 13) = 9763 / 2860
21/13 = (21 * 220) / (13 * 220) = 4620 / 2860

Now we can add the fractions:

9763/2860 + 4620/2860 = (9763 + 4620) / 2860 = 14383 / 2860

Simplifying the fraction:
14383 / 2860 = 5029 / 1001

65/15 = 65 * (480/15) / (480/15) = 2080/480

Adding the fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we found that 70/25 + 83/28 = 4035/700.

Now, we need to subtract 47/13 from 4035/700.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 700 and 13.
LCM(700, 13) = 9100

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 9100.
4035/700 = (4035 Ã— 13)/(700 Ã— 13) = 52455/9100
47/13 = (47 Ã— 700)/(13 Ã— 700) = 32900/9100

Step 3: Subtract the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
52455/9100 - 32900/9100 = (52455 - 32900)/9100 = 19555/9100

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
19555/9100 = 215/100

            Let's revise the problem from before. If instead of having 70/25 oranges, you had 70/25 apples, and instead of having 83/28 more apples, you had 83/8 more oranges. What is the total of apples and oranges you have now?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this revised problem step by step. We need to find the total number of apples and oranges.

Given:
- You have 70/25 apples.
- You have 83/8 oranges.

Step 1: Convert the mixed number of oranges to an improper fraction.
83/8 = 8 + 3/8 = 64/8 + 3/8 = 67/8

Step 2: Add the number of apples and oranges.
Apples + Oranges = 70/25 + 67/8

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 25 and 8 is 200.

Step 3: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 200.
70/25 = (70 Ã— 8)/(25 Ã— 8) = 560/200
67/8 = (67 Ã— 25)/(8 Ã— 25) = 1675/200

Step 4: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
560/200 + 1675/200 = (560 + 1675)/200 = 2235/200

Step 5: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
2235/200 cannot be simplified further as the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.

Therefore, the total of apples and oranges is 2235/200.

50/73 = (50 Ã— 23) / (73 Ã— 23) = 1150/1679
20/23 = (20 Ã— 73) / (23 Ã— 73) = 1460/1679

Adding the numerators:

1150/1679 + 1460/1679 = (1150 + 1460)/1679 = 2610/1679

Now, we need to add 83/35 to 2610/1679.

First, let's find the common denominator by calculating the LCM of 1679 and 35.

LCM(1679, 35) = 58765

Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

2610/1679 = (2610 Ã— 35) / (1679 Ã— 35) = 91350/58765
83/35 = (83 Ã— 1679) / (35 Ã— 1679) = 139357/58765

Adding the numerators:

91350/58765 + 139357/58765 = (91350 + 139357)/58765 = 230707/58765

94 / 35 = 2 24/35 (Divide 94 by 35 to get a mixed number)
23 / 49 = 23/49 (This division results in a proper fraction, no need to simplify further)

Now, we need to subtract 23/49 from 2 24/35.

First, convert 2 24/35 to an improper fraction:
2 24/35 = (2 Ã— 35 + 24) / 35 = 94/35

Then, subtract the fractions:
94/35 - 23/49

To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.
LCM(35, 49) = 1715

Multiply the numerators and denominators of each fraction by the appropriate factor to get the common denominator:
(94 Ã— 49) / (35 Ã— 49) - (23 Ã— 35) / (49 Ã— 35) = 4606/1715 - 805/1715

Now, perform the subtraction:
(4606 - 805) / 1715 = 3801 / 1715

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD):

LCM(53, 50) = 2650

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

45/53 = (45 Ã— 50) / (53 Ã— 50) = 2250/2650
71/50 = (71 Ã— 53) / (50 Ã— 53) = 3763/2650

Adding the fractions:

2250/2650 + 3763/2650 = (2250 + 3763) / 2650 = 6013/2650

        <pre class="model-raw-response">I apologize for the confusion. Let's solve the problem with the correct fraction, 30/97.

To find the sum of 30/97 and 29/6, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 97 and 6.

LCM(97, 6) = 582

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

30/97 = (30 Ã— 6)/(97 Ã— 6) = 180/582
29/6 = (29 Ã— 97)/(6 Ã— 97) = 2813/582

Adding the fractions:

180/582 + 2813/582 = (180 + 2813)/582 = 2993/582

Simplifying the fraction:

2993/582 cannot be simplified further as the greatest common factor (GCF) of 2993 and 582 is 1.

Now we can subtract:

1947/66 - 11/66 = (1947 - 11) / 66 = 1936/66

Simplifying the fraction:

63/51 = (63 Ã— 33) / (51 Ã— 33) = 2079/1683
968/33 = (968 Ã— 51) / (33 Ã— 51) = 49368/1683

Now we can add:

2079/1683 + 49368/1683 = (2079 + 49368) / 1683 = 51447/1683

Simplifying the fraction:
51447/1683 = 51447/1683 (already in lowest terms)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to convert 59/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 31 (to match the denominator of 11/31).

59/2 = (59 Ã— 31) / (2 Ã— 31) = 1829/62

Now we can subtract 11/31 from 1829/62:

1829/62 - 11/31 = (1829 Ã— 31 - 11 Ã— 62) / (62 Ã— 31)
               = (56699 - 682) / 1922
               = 56017 / 1922

Simplifying the fraction:
56017 / 1922 = 113 Ã— 495 / (2 Ã— 961)
             = 113 Ã— 495 / 1922
             = 55935 / 1922

23 = 1 Ã— 23

LCM(23, 26) = 2 Ã— 13 Ã— 23 = 598

Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 598:

58/23 = (58 Ã— 26) / (23 Ã— 26) = 1508/598
25/26 = (25 Ã— 23) / (26 Ã— 23) = 575/598

Adding the fractions:

1508/598 + 575/598 = (1508 + 575) / 598 = 2083/598

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's calculate the sum of 45/23 and 25/26 and compare it to the original sum of 58/23 and 25/26.

As before, the common denominator is LCM(23, 26) = 598.

Converting 45/23 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 598:

45/23 = (45 Ã— 26) / (23 Ã— 26) = 1170/598

Now, adding 1170/598 and 25/26 (which we previously converted to 575/598):

1170/598 + 575/598 = (1170 + 575) / 598 = 1745/598

Simplifying the result:

1745/598 cannot be simplified further as the GCD of 1745 and 598 is 1.

Comparing the two sums:

Original sum: 58/23 + 25/26 = 2083/598
New sum: 45/23 + 25/26 = 1745/598

To find the difference, subtract the new sum from the original sum:

2083/598 - 1745/598 = (2083 - 1745) / 598 = 338/598

Simplifying 338/598:

338/598 = 13/23 (dividing both numerator and denominator by their GCD of 26)

Therefore, the original sum is 13/23 greater than the new sum.

Step 1: Find the LCM of the denominators 13 and 52.
LCM(13, 52) = 52 (since 52 is divisible by 13)

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
70/13 = (70 Ã— 4)/(13 Ã— 4) = 280/52
17/52 (already has the common denominator)

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
280/52 + 17/52 = (280 + 17)/52 = 297/52

Now, we need to subtract 35/87 from 297/52.

Step 1: Find the LCM of the denominators 52 and 87.
LCM(52, 87) = 1,044 (since 1,044 is divisible by both 52 and 87)

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
297/52 = (297 Ã— 20)/(52 Ã— 20) = 5,940/1,044
35/87 = (35 Ã— 12)/(87 Ã— 12) = 420/1,044

Step 3: Subtract the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
5,940/1,044 - 420/1,044 = (5,940 - 420)/1,044 = 5,520/1,044

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction.
5,520/1,044 = 460/87 (divide both numerator and denominator by 12)

Now, let's add the numerators:
43 + 71 = 114

So, (43 + 71)/4 = 114/4

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). In this case, the GCF of 114 and 4 is 2.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            What is the sum of 43/4 and 71/4 plus 92/79?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 43/4, 71/4, and 92/79, we first need to find a common denominator for all three fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 79 is 316.

Let's convert 43/4 and 71/4 to fractions with a denominator of 316:

43/4 = (43 Ã— 79)/316 = 3397/316
71/4 = (71 Ã— 79)/316 = 5609/316

Now, we can add the three fractions:

3397/316 + 5609/316 + 92/79

To add fractions with the same denominator, we add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:

(3397 + 5609 + 92)/316

Now, let's add the numerators:
3397 + 5609 + 92 = 9098

So, (3397 + 5609 + 92)/316 = 9098/316

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). In this case, the GCF of 9098 and 316 is 2.

9098 Ã· 2 = 4549
316 Ã· 2 = 158

Therefore, 9098/316 simplifies to 4549/158.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this case, we are adding fractions with different denominators. To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.

The denominators are 4 and 89. To find the LCM, we can first find the prime factorization of each number:

4 = 2^2
89 is already prime

The LCM is the product of the highest power of each prime factor: 2^2 * 89 = 4 * 89 = 356

Now, we need to convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator:

43/4 = (43 * 89)/(4 * 89) = 3827/356
71/89 = (71 * 4)/(89 * 4) = 284/356

Now we can add the fractions:

3827/356 + 284/356 = (3827 + 284)/356 = 4111/356

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). In this case, the GCF of 4111 and 356 is 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.

Given fractions: 17/74 and 53/27

Step 1: Find the LCM of 74 and 27.
LCM(74, 27) = 1998

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1998.
17/74 = (17 Ã— 27) / (74 Ã— 27) = 459/1998
53/27 = (53 Ã— 74) / (27 Ã— 74) = 3922/1998

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions and keep the common denominator.
(459 + 3922) / 1998 = 4381/1998

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
4381/1998 cannot be simplified further as the GCD(4381, 1998) = 1.

Therefore, the sum of 17/74 and 53/27 is 4381/1998.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract 23/29 from the previous result (4381/1998), we need to find a common denominator between 1998 and 29.

Given fractions: 4381/1998 and 23/29

Step 1: Find the LCM of 1998 and 29.
LCM(1998, 29) = 57942

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 57942.
4381/1998 = (4381 Ã— 29) / (1998 Ã— 29) = 127049/57942
23/29 = (23 Ã— 1998) / (29 Ã— 1998) = 45954/57942

Step 3: Subtract the numerators of the equivalent fractions and keep the common denominator.
(127049 - 45954) / 57942 = 81095/57942

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
81095/57942 = 1401/1002

Therefore, the result of subtracting 23/29 from 4381/1998 is 1401/1002.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step. We are given that 28/74 of the fruit basket is filled with oranges, and we add 53/27 of the basket filled with apples.

Given fractions: 28/74 and 53/27

Step 1: Find the LCM of 74 and 27.
LCM(74, 27) = 1998

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1998.
28/74 = (28 Ã— 27) / (74 Ã— 27) = 756/1998
53/27 = (53 Ã— 74) / (27 Ã— 74) = 3922/1998

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions and keep the common denominator.
(756 + 3922) / 1998 = 4678/1998

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
4678/1998 = 2339/999 (divided both numerator and denominator by their GCD of 2)

Therefore, if 28/74 of the fruit basket is filled with oranges and 53/27 of the basket is filled with apples, the total fraction of the fruit basket filled with these fruits is 2339/999.

2. (96/16) = 6
   To divide 96 by 16, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
   The GCF of 96 and 16 is 16.
   (96/16) = (96/16) Ã· (16/16) = (6/1) = 6

   To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 96 and 33.

Now, let's add the two fractions:

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 11.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 60/79 and 53/38, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 79 and 38.

LCM(79, 38) = 2 Ã— 79 = 158 (since 79 is prime and 38 is 2 Ã— 19)

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 158:

60/79 = (60 Ã— 2)/(79 Ã— 2) = 120/158
53/38 = (53 Ã— 79)/(38 Ã— 79) = 4187/3002

Adding the fractions:
120/158 + 4187/3002 = (120 Ã— 3002 + 4187 Ã— 158) / (158 Ã— 3002)
                    = (360240 + 661566) / 474316
                    = 1021806 / 474316
                    = 2.154 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 48 and 84.
LCM(48, 84) = 336

Step 2: Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator of 336.
39/48 = 39 Ã— 7/48 Ã— 7 = 273/336
19/84 = 19 Ã— 4/84 Ã— 4 = 76/336

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
273/336 + 76/336 = (273 + 76)/336 = 349/336

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step.

Step 1: From the previous question, we found that 39/48 + 19/84 = 349/336.

Step 2: Now, we need to add this result to itself. In other words, we need to calculate 349/336 + 349/336.

Step 3: When adding fractions with the same denominator, we simply add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.
349/336 + 349/336 = (349 + 349)/336 = 698/336

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
698/336 = 349/168 (dividing both numerator and denominator by 2)

The fraction 349/168 cannot be simplified further as the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.

Step 2: Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator of 624.
39/48 = 39 Ã— 13/48 Ã— 13 = 507/624
19/13 = 19 Ã— 48/13 Ã— 48 = 912/624

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 16/86 and 60/3, we need to convert them to a common denominator and then add the numerators.

1. Convert 60/3 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 86:
   60/3 = 20/1 = (20 Ã— 43)/(1 Ã— 43) = 860/43

2. Now we have:
   16/86 + 860/43

3. To add these fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 86 and 43, which is 86 Ã— 43 = 3698.

4. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 3698:
   16/86 = (16 Ã— 43)/(86 Ã— 43) = 688/3698
   860/43 = (860 Ã— 86)/(43 Ã— 86) = 73960/3698

5. Add the numerators:
   688/3698 + 73960/3698 = (688 + 73960)/3698 = 74648/3698

6. Simplify the resulting fraction:
   74648/3698 = 202/10

Therefore, the sum of 16/86 and 60/3 is 202/10.

Adding 320/64 and 32/64:
320/64 + 32/64 = (320 + 32)/64 = 352/64

Simplifying the result:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of 10/14 and 70/20, we need to convert them to a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 14 and 20.

LCM(14, 20) = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 5 Ã— 7 = 140

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 140:

10/14 = (10 Ã— 10) / (14 Ã— 10) = 100/140
70/20 = (70 Ã— 7) / (20 Ã— 7) = 490/140

Adding the fractions:
100/140 + 490/140 = 590/140

To convert the result to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.

LCM of 44 and 5 is 220.

Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

33/5 = (33 Ã— 44) / (5 Ã— 44) = 1452/220
19/44 = (19 Ã— 5) / (44 Ã— 5) = 95/220

Now we can subtract:

1452/220 - 95/220 = (1452 - 95) / 220 = 1357/220

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

The GCD of 1357 and 220 is 1.

Therefore, the fraction 1357/220 cannot be simplified further.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">From the previous problem, we found that 33/5 - 19/44 = 1357/220.

Now, we need to add 32/76 to 1357/220.

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.

LCM of 220 and 76 is 16720.

Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

1357/220 = (1357 Ã— 76) / (220 Ã— 76) = 103132/16720
32/76 = (32 Ã— 220) / (76 Ã— 220) = 7040/16720

Now we can add:

103132/16720 + 7040/16720 = (103132 + 7040) / 16720 = 110172/16720

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

The GCD of 110172 and 16720 is 4.

110172/16720 = (110172 Ã· 4) / (16720 Ã· 4) = 27543/4180

            Previously, we calculated the result of subtracting 19/44 from 33/5. But what if instead of subtracting 19/44, we subtracted 17/44 from 33/5? What would be the new result?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll follow the same process as before, but with the new fraction 17/44.

Given:
- We need to subtract 17/44 from 33/5.

Step 1: Find the common denominator by calculating the LCM of 44 and 5.
LCM(44, 5) = 220

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
33/5 = (33 Ã— 44) / (5 Ã— 44) = 1452/220
17/44 = (17 Ã— 5) / (44 Ã— 5) = 85/220

Step 3: Subtract the fractions.
1452/220 - 85/220 = (1452 - 85) / 220 = 1367/220

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD.
GCD(1367, 220) = 1

Since the GCD is 1, the fraction 1367/220 is already in its simplest form.

88/58 = (88 Ã— 75) / 4350 = 6600/4350

Adding the numerators:

3. Now, we have:

4. To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is already 37, so we only need to convert 2 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 37:
   2 = 2 Ã— (37 / 37) = 74 / 37

5. Now we can add the fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Calculate (36 / 37) + (8 / 4):
   - 36 / 37 cannot be simplified further
   - 8 / 4 = 2
   - (36 / 37) + 2
   - Convert 2 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 37:
     2 = 2 Ã— (37 / 37) = 74 / 37
   - Add the fractions:
     (36 / 37) + (74 / 37) = (36 + 74) / 37 = 110 / 37

2. Add the result (110 / 37) to itself:
   - (110 / 37) + (110 / 37)
   - The denominators are the same, so we can add the numerators:
     (110 + 110) / 37 = 220 / 37

Therefore, the final result is 220 / 37.

            Initially, you calculated (36 / 37) + (8 / 4) and added the result to itself. Now, suppose the initial calculation was actually (36 / 37) + (8 / 56) instead. What is the new result?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">I apologize for the confusion. Let's solve the problem with the correct initial calculation: (36 / 37) + (8 / 56).

1. First, let's simplify the fraction 36 / 37:
   36 / 37 cannot be simplified further, so it remains 36 / 37.

2. Next, let's simplify the fraction 8 / 56:
   8 / 56 = 1 / 7

3. Now, we have:
   (36 / 37) + (1 / 7)

4. To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of 37 and 7.
   LCM(37, 7) = 259

5. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:
   (36 / 37) = (36 Ã— 7) / (37 Ã— 7) = 252 / 259
   (1 / 7) = (1 Ã— 37) / (7 Ã— 37) = 37 / 259

6. Now we can add the fractions:
   (252 / 259) + (37 / 259) = (252 + 37) / 259 = 289 / 259

Therefore, the result of (36 / 37) + (8 / 56) is 289 / 259.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the result of (57 / 22) - (72 / 48), we need to perform the division operations and then subtract the results. Let's do this step by step.

Step 1: Simplify 57 / 22
57 / 22 = 2 13/22 (mixed fraction)
2 13/22 = (2 Ã— 22 + 13) / 22 = 57 / 22 (improper fraction)

Step 2: Simplify 72 / 48
72 / 48 = 1 1/2 (mixed fraction)
1 1/2 = (1 Ã— 2 + 1) / 2 = 3 / 2 (improper fraction)

Step 3: Subtract the fractions
(57 / 22) - (3 / 2)

To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD). The LCD of 22 and 2 is 22.

Multiply the second fraction by 11/11 to get an equivalent fraction with the denominator of 22:
(3 / 2) Ã— (11 / 11) = 33 / 22

Now we can subtract the fractions:
(57 / 22) - (33 / 22) = (57 - 33) / 22 = 24 / 22

Step 4: Simplify the result
24 / 22 = 12 / 11 (divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2)

Therefore, (57 / 22) - (72 / 48) = 12 / 11.

= 1368 / 528 - 792 / 528
= (1368 - 792) / 528
= 576 / 528
= 12 / 11 (simplified)

Now, let's add this result (12 / 11) to itself.

(12 / 11) + (12 / 11)
= (12 Ã— 11) / (11 Ã— 11) + (12 Ã— 11) / (11 Ã— 11)

            Originally, you calculated the result of (57 / 22) - (72 / 48) and expressed your answer as a fraction in the simplest form. Now, consider the scenario where you miscalculated and the second fraction was actually (72 / 100) instead of (72 / 48). Recalculate the expression (57 / 22) - (72 / 100). What is the final simplified fraction in this case?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">I apologize for the confusion. Let's recalculate the expression (57 / 22) - (72 / 100) and find the final simplified fraction.

Step 1: Simplify 57 / 22 (this remains the same as in the previous calculation)
57 / 22 = 2 13/22 (mixed fraction)
2 13/22 = (2 Ã— 22 + 13) / 22 = 57 / 22 (improper fraction)

Step 2: Simplify 72 / 100
72 / 100 = 18 / 25 (divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4)

Step 3: Subtract the fractions
(57 / 22) - (18 / 25)

To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD). The LCD of 22 and 25 is 550 (22 Ã— 25 = 550).

Multiply the first fraction by 25/25 and the second fraction by 22/22 to get equivalent fractions with the denominator of 550:
(57 / 22) Ã— (25 / 25) = 1425 / 550
(18 / 25) Ã— (22 / 22) = 396 / 550

Now we can subtract the fractions:
(1425 / 550) - (396 / 550) = (1425 - 396) / 550 = 1029 / 550

Step 4: Simplify the result
1029 / 550 = 1 479/550 (mixed fraction)
1 479/550 = (1 Ã— 550 + 479) / 550 = 1029 / 550 (improper fraction)

The fraction 1029 / 550 cannot be simplified further as the greatest common factor of 1029 and 550 is 1.

Therefore, (57 / 22) - (72 / 100) = 1029 / 550.

Adding the fractions:

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
113/40 = (113 Ã— 8)/(40 Ã— 8) = 904/320
24/64 = (24 Ã— 5)/(64 Ã— 5) = 120/320

Step 3: Subtract the fractions with the common denominator.
904/320 - 120/320 = (904 - 120)/320 = 784/320

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
784/320 = (784 Ã· 16)/(320 Ã· 16) = 49/20

        <pre class="model-raw-response">I apologize for the confusion. Let's calculate the summation of 83/18 + 6/8 using the same steps as before.

Step 1: Find the common denominator by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 8.
LCM(18, 8) = 72 (since 72 is the smallest number divisible by both 18 and 8)

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
83/18 = (83 Ã— 4)/(18 Ã— 4) = 332/72
6/8 = (6 Ã— 9)/(8 Ã— 9) = 54/72

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
332/72 + 54/72 = (332 + 54)/72 = 386/72

LCM(69, 61) = 69 Ã— 61 = 4209 (since 69 and 61 are prime numbers)

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

37/69 = (37 Ã— 61) / (69 Ã— 61) = 2257/4209
67/61 = (67 Ã— 69) / (61 Ã— 69) = 4623/4209

Adding the fractions:

2257/4209 + 4623/4209 = (2257 + 4623) / 4209 = 6880/4209

Simplifying the result:

6880/4209 cannot be simplified further as the GCD(6880, 4209) = 1.

37/69 + 67/61 = 6880/4209

Now, we need to add 100/7 to 6880/4209.

First, find the LCM of the denominators:
LCM(4209, 7) = 4209 Ã— 7 = 29463 (since 4209 and 7 are prime numbers)

Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

6880/4209 = (6880 Ã— 7) / (4209 Ã— 7) = 48160/29463
100/7 = (100 Ã— 4209) / (7 Ã— 4209) = 420900/29463

Adding the fractions:

48160/29463 + 420900/29463 = (48160 + 420900) / 29463 = 469060/29463

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 89/84 and 75/34, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 84 and 34.

84 = 2Â² Ã— 3 Ã— 7
34 = 2 Ã— 17

LCM(84, 34) = 2Â² Ã— 3 Ã— 7 Ã— 17 = 1428

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1428:

89/84 = (89 Ã— 17) / (84 Ã— 17) = 1513/1428
75/34 = (75 Ã— 42) / (34 Ã— 42) = 3150/1428

Adding the fractions:

1513/1428 + 3150/1428 = (1513 + 3150) / 1428 = 4663/1428

Simplifying the result:

4663/1428 = 3 263/1428 (dividing both numerator and denominator by their GCD of 1)

Therefore, the sum of 89/84 and 75/34 is 3 263/1428.

From the previous answer, S = 7,665/6,474

Now, we need to add S and 71/92.

First, let's find the LCM of the denominators 6,474 and 92:
6,474 = 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 13 Ã— 83
92 = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 23
LCM = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 13 Ã— 23 Ã— 83 = 149,226

Converting S and 71/92 to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

S = 7,665/6,474 = 7,665 Ã— (149,226/6,474) / (149,226/6,474) = 176,645/149,226
71/92 = 71 Ã— (149,226/92) / (149,226/92) = 115,271/149,226

Adding the fractions:
176,645/149,226 + 115,271/149,226 = (176,645 + 115,271)/149,226 = 291,916/149,226

Step 1: Find the LCM of 85 and 55.
LCM(85, 55) = 4675

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 4675.
99/85 = 99 Ã— (4675/85) / (85 Ã— (4675/85)) = 5445/4675

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the value of 97 / 56 - 31 / 52, we need to perform the division operations and then subtract the results. Let's solve this step by step.

Step 1: Simplify 97 / 56
97 / 56 = 97/56 (cannot be simplified further)

Step 2: Simplify 31 / 52
31 / 52 = 31/52 (cannot be simplified further)

Step 3: Subtract the fractions
97/56 - 31/52

To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD).
The LCD of 56 and 52 is 56 Ã— 52 = 2912.

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator:
97/56 = 97 Ã— 52/56 Ã— 52 = 5044/2912
31/52 = 31 Ã— 56/52 Ã— 56 = 1736/2912

Subtracting the fractions:
5044/2912 - 1736/2912 = (5044 - 1736)/2912 = 3308/2912

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's continue from the previous answer and add 100 / 25 to 827 / 728.

Step 1: Simplify 100 / 25
100 / 25 = 4 (dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 25)

Step 2: Add 827 / 728 and 4
827/728 + 4

To add a whole number to a fraction, we can convert the whole number to a fraction with the same denominator as the other fraction:
4 = 4 Ã— 728/728 = 2912/728

Now, we can add the fractions:
827/728 + 2912/728 = (827 + 2912)/728 = 3739/728

Step 3: Simplify the resulting fraction
3739/728 cannot be simplified further as the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step, using the same method as before.

Given: 97/56 - 26/52

Step 1: Simplify 97/56
97/56 (cannot be simplified further)

Step 2: Simplify 26/52
26/52 = 1/2 (dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 26)

Step 3: Subtract the fractions
97/56 - 1/2

To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD).
The LCD of 56 and 2 is 56 Ã— 2 = 112.

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator:
97/56 = 97 Ã— 2/56 Ã— 2 = 194/112
1/2 = 1 Ã— 56/2 Ã— 56 = 56/112

Subtracting the fractions:
194/112 - 56/112 = (194 - 56)/112 = 138/112

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction
138/112 = 69/56 (dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 2)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of (33 / 23) - (12 / 75), we need to perform the division operations and then subtract the results. Let's solve this step by step.

Step 1: Divide 33 by 23
33 Ã· 23 = 1 10/23 = 33/23

Step 2: Divide 12 by 75
12 Ã· 75 = 4/25 = 16/100

Step 3: Subtract the results from Step 1 and Step 2
33/23 - 16/100

To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.
LCM of 23 and 100 is 2300.

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 2300:
33/23 = 3300/2300
16/100 = 368/2300

Step 4: Perform the subtraction
3300/2300 - 368/2300 = 2932/2300

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
GCF of 2932 and 2300 is 4.

2932/4 / 2300/4 = 733/575

Therefore, (33 / 23) - (12 / 75) = 733/575

Now, we need to add 733/575 and 24/81.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 575 and 81.
LCM(575, 81) = 46575

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 46575.
733/575 = 59293/46575
24/81 = 13700/46575

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
59293/46575 + 13700/46575 = (59293 + 13700)/46575 = 72993/46575

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
GCF(72993, 46575) = 1

Since the GCF is 1, the fraction 72993/46575 is already in its simplest form.

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF):

Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator of 80:

47/16 = 47 Ã— 5/16 Ã— 5 = 235/80
96/10 = 96 Ã— 8/10 Ã— 8 = 768/80

Now, we can add the fractions:

235/80 + 768/80 = (235 + 768)/80 = 1003/80

To express the result as a mixed fraction, we divide 1003 by 80:

72/22 = 72 Ã— 4/22 Ã— 4 = 288/88

Next, we convert the mixed fraction 12 43/80 to an improper fraction:

12 43/80 = (12 Ã— 80 + 43)/80 = 1003/80

Now, we can subtract 288/88 from 1003/80:

1003/80 - 288/88 = 1003/80 - 330/80 = 673/80

To express the result as a mixed fraction, we divide 673 by 80:

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 90:

26/90 = 26/90
50/26 = (50 Ã— 90) / (26 Ã— 90) = 4500/2340

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the expression 79/32 - 52/55, we need to perform the subtraction operation on the two fractions. However, we can only subtract fractions if they have the same denominator. So, we first need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 32 and 55.

Step 1: Find the LCD of 32 and 55.
LCD = 32 Ã— 55 = 1760

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
79/32 = 79 Ã— 55/32 Ã— 55 = 4345/1760
52/55 = 52 Ã— 32/55 Ã— 32 = 1664/1760

Step 3: Subtract the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
4345/1760 - 1664/1760 = (4345 - 1664)/1760 = 2681/1760

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction.
2681/1760 cannot be simplified further as the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.

Therefore, 79/32 - 52/55 = 2681/1760.

Now, we need to add 2681/1760 and 42/99.

Step 1: Find the LCD of 1760 and 99.
LCD = 1760 Ã— 99 = 174240

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
2681/1760 = 2681 Ã— 99/1760 Ã— 99 = 265419/174240
42/99 = 42 Ã— 1760/99 Ã— 1760 = 73920/174240

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
265419/174240 + 73920/174240 = (265419 + 73920)/174240 = 339339/174240

Step 3: Subtract the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
4345/1760 - 224/1760 = (4345 - 224)/1760 = 4121/1760

2. Find the length of the piece they sold:
   The piece they sold is 18/90 feet shorter than the usual length.
   18/90 feet = 0.2 feet (dividing both the numerator and denominator by 18)

Now, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

15/74 = 15 Ã— (3404/74) / (3404/74) = 690/3404

Adding the fractions:

3667/3404 + 690/3404 = (3667 + 690)/3404 = 4357/3404

Simplifying the fraction:

4357 and 3404 have a common factor of 17.

1) First, let's convert 54/1 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 30:

2) Now we have:

3) Since the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators:
   (1620 + 62)/30 = 1682/30

4) To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
   The GCF of 1682 and 30 is 2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) From the previous question, we know that 54/1 + 62/30 = 841/15

2) Now we need to subtract 53/41 from 841/15

3) To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. Let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 41.
   LCM(15, 41) = 15 Ã— 41 = 615

4) Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 615:
   841/15 = (841 Ã— 41)/(15 Ã— 41) = 34481/615
   53/41 = (53 Ã— 15)/(41 Ã— 15) = 795/615

5) Now we can subtract:
   34481/615 - 795/615 = (34481 - 795)/615 = 33686/615

6) Let's simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCF.
   The GCF of 33686 and 615 is 2.
   (33686 Ã· 2)/(615 Ã· 2) = 16843/307.5

7) 307.5 is a decimal, so let's multiply both numerator and denominator by 2 to get rid of the decimal:
   (16843 Ã— 2)/(307.5 Ã— 2) = 33686/615

8) The GCF of 33686 and 615 is 2, so let's simplify one more time:
   (33686 Ã· 2)/(615 Ã· 2) = 16843/307.5

9) Again, we have a decimal in the denominator. Let's multiply by 2 again:
   (16843 Ã— 2)/(307.5 Ã— 2) = 33686/615

10) Now, 33686/615 cannot be simplified further as the GCF of 33686 and 615 is 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, similar to the previous one.

1) First, convert 93/1 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 30:
   93/1 = (93 Ã— 30)/(1 Ã— 30) = 2790/30

2) Now we have:
   2790/30 + 62/30

3) Since the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators:
   (2790 + 62)/30 = 2852/30

4) To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
   The GCF of 2852 and 30 is 6.
   (2852 Ã· 6)/(30 Ã· 6) = 476/5

5) 476/5 cannot be simplified further as the GCF of 476 and 5 is 1.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            What value do you get by adding 85/29 and 47/7?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is the product of the denominators: 29 * 7 = 203.

Now, let's convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator:

85/29 = (85 * 7) / (29 * 7) = 595/203
47/7 = (47 * 29) / (7 * 29) = 1363/203

Now we can add the numerators and keep the common denominator:

595/203 + 1363/203 = (595 + 1363) / 203 = 1958/203

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). The GCF of 1958 and 203 is 7.

(1958/7) / (203/7) = 279/29

Therefore, the sum of 85/29 and 47/7 is 279/29.
