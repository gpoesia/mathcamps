        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1) We know that the clock ticks 225 times in one hour.

2) We want to find out how many times it will tick in 65 hours.

3) To find this, we need to multiply the number of ticks per hour by the number of hours:

   Ticks in 65 hours = Ticks per hour Ã— Number of hours
                     = 225 Ã— 65
                     = 14,625

Therefore, the clock will tick 14,625 times in 65 hours.

Given:
- The clock ticks 225 times per hour.
- We want to find out how many times it will tick in 37 hours.

Step 1: To find the total number of ticks in 37 hours, multiply the number of ticks per hour by the number of hours.

Ticks in 37 hours = Ticks per hour Ã— Number of hours
                   = 225 Ã— 37

1. Understand the given information:
   * The jeweler produces 423 rings each day.
   * The jeweler has been producing rings for 128 days.

2. To find the total number of rings produced, we need to multiply the number of rings produced per day by the number of days:
   * Total rings = Rings per day Ã— Number of days

Given:
* The banana plantation now produces 3185 bananas per tree.
* The farmer still has two trees.

Let's calculate the total number of bananas produced from these two trees:
* Number of bananas from one tree = 3185
* Number of trees = 2
* Total number of bananas = Number of bananas from one tree Ã— Number of trees
* Total number of bananas = 3185 Ã— 2 = 6370

Therefore, if the farmer's trees were only able to produce 3185 bananas each, the two trees would produce a total of 6370 bananas together.

Given:
- The toy factory now produces 452 stuffed animals every hour.
- They still operate for 197 hours.

Calculation:
Total stuffed animals produced = Stuffed animals per hour Ã— Number of hours
Total stuffed animals produced = 452 Ã— 197 = &lt;&lt;452*197=89044&gt;&gt;89,044

Therefore, with the increased production rate of 452 stuffed animals per hour, the toy factory would produce 89,044 stuffed animals in 197 hours.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The factory produces 591 pairs of ice skates in a day.
   * They operate for 3 days straight.

2. To find the total number of ice skates produced in 3 days, we need to multiply the daily production by the number of days:
   * Total pairs of ice skates = Daily production Ã— Number of days
   * Total pairs of ice skates = 591 Ã— 3
   * Total pairs of ice skates = 1,773

Therefore, the factory produces 1,773 pairs of ice skates in 3 days.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of sandwiches sold in 103 days, given that the shop sells 832 sandwiches each day.

Given:
- The sandwich shop sells 832 sandwiches each day.
- We want to know the number of sandwiches sold in 103 days.

To find the total number of sandwiches sold in 103 days, we need to multiply the number of sandwiches sold each day by the number of days:

Total sandwiches sold = Sandwiches sold each day Ã— Number of days
Total sandwiches sold = 832 Ã— 103
Total sandwiches sold = 85,696

Therefore, the sandwich shop sells 85,696 sandwiches in 103 days.

Given:
- The sandwich shop sells 832 sandwiches each day.

To find the total number of sandwiches sold in 15 days, we need to multiply the number of sandwiches sold each day by the number of days:

Total sandwiches sold = Sandwiches sold each day Ã— Number of days
Total sandwiches sold = 832 Ã— 15
Total sandwiches sold = 12,480

1. Understand the given information:
   * One monkey can peel 1416 bananas in one hour.
   * We want to find out how many bananas ten monkeys can peel in one hour.

2. Realize that if one monkey can peel 1416 bananas in one hour, then ten monkeys can peel ten times as many bananas in the same amount of time.

3. Calculate the number of bananas ten monkeys can peel:
   * Number of bananas ten monkeys can peel = 1416 Ã— 10
   * Number of bananas ten monkeys can peel = 14160

Therefore, ten monkeys would be able to peel 14160 bananas in one hour.

Given:
- There are ten monkeys.
- Each monkey can peel 4876 bananas in an hour.

To find the total number of bananas the ten monkeys can peel in an hour, we need to multiply the number of bananas one monkey can peel by the number of monkeys.

Total bananas peeled = Number of bananas one monkey can peel Ã— Number of monkeys
Total bananas peeled = 4876 Ã— 10
Total bananas peeled = 48760

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The company can produce 4116 marshmallows in one hour.
* The company operates for 3 hours.

To find the total number of marshmallows produced in 3 hours, we need to multiply the number of marshmallows produced in one hour by the number of hours the company operates.

Marshmallows produced in 3 hours = Marshmallows per hour Ã— Number of hours
Marshmallows produced in 3 hours = 4116 Ã— 3 = &lt;&lt;4116*3=12348&gt;&gt;12348

Therefore, the company will produce 12348 marshmallows in 3 hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same formula as before, but with the new speed.

Given:
- The plane's new speed is 43 kilometers per hour.
- The plane flies continuously for 109 hours.

Using the formula: Distance = Speed Ã— Time

Distance = 43 km/h Ã— 109 h
Distance = 4,687 km

So, if the plane was flying at a slower speed of 43 kilometers per hour for 109 hours, it would have flown a total distance of 4,687 kilometers.

Given:
- The snail's speed is 1681 millimeters per hour.
- The snail travels for 37 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled by the snail.
Total distance = Speed Ã— Time
Total distance = 1681 millimeters/hour Ã— 37 hours

To find out how much the designer spends on beads, we need to multiply the cost of each bead by the number of beads purchased.

Cost of beads = Cost per bead Ã— Number of beads
Cost of beads = $1056 Ã— 37
Cost of beads = $39,072

* A rainbow occurred 1347 times in one year in a particular area.
* 22 years have passed since the record was kept.

To find the total number of times the rainbow has been spotted in those 22 years, we need to multiply the number of occurrences in one year by the number of years.

1347 occurrences/year Ã— 22 years = 1347 Ã— 22 = 29634

Therefore, the rainbow has been spotted 29,634 times in the 22 years since the record was kept.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The price of each new phone model is $3915.
* The store sells 15 of these phones.

To find the total revenue generated from selling these phones, we need to multiply the price of each phone by the number of phones sold.

Revenue = Price per phone Ã— Number of phones sold
Revenue = $3915 Ã— 15
Revenue = $58,725

Therefore, the store generates a revenue of $58,725 from selling 15 of these new phone models.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that the bike shop had 3978 bicycle tires in stock.
2. They sold the tires in sets of 21.
3. To find out how many sets of 21 tires they sold, we need to divide the total number of tires by 21.

3978 Ã· 21 = 189 remainder 9

This means they sold 189 complete sets of 21 tires.

4. Now, let's calculate the total number of tires sold:

189 sets Ã— 21 tires per set = 3969 tires

Therefore, the bike shop sold 3969 tires altogether.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The factory produces 181 chips every hour.
* The factory works non-stop for 475 hours.

To find the total number of chips produced, we need to multiply the number of chips produced per hour by the total number of hours worked.

Chips produced per hour = 181
Total hours worked = 475

Total chips produced = Chips produced per hour Ã— Total hours worked
Total chips produced = 181 Ã— 475 = &lt;&lt;181*475=86075&gt;&gt;86,075

Therefore, the factory would have produced 86,075 chips in total after working non-stop for 475 hours.

Given:
* The computer's speed is reduced, and it can now execute 125 operations in 1 millisecond.

To find the total number of operations executed with the reduced speed, we multiply the new number of operations per millisecond by the total number of milliseconds:

Operations executed = Operations per millisecond Ã— Total milliseconds
Operations executed = 125 Ã— 192
Operations executed = 24,000
