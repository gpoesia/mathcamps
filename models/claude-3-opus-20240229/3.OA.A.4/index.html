        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Each castle requires 5 builders.
   * There are 15 builders in total.

2. To find the number of castles being built, we need to divide the total number of builders by the number of builders required for each castle.

3. Number of castles = Total number of builders ÷ Builders required per castle
   * Number of castles = 15 ÷ 5
   * Number of castles = 3

Therefore, the king is building 3 castles in his kingdom.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The manufacturer can produce 8 watches every hour.
   * They have manufactured a total of 48 watches.

2. Set up an equation:
   * Let's say the number of hours they worked is x.
   * Since they produce 8 watches per hour, after x hours they will have produced 8x watches.
   * We know the total number of watches produced is 48.
   * So, we can write the equation: 8x = 48

3. Solve the equation:
   * To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 8.
   * 8x ÷ 8 = 48 ÷ 8
   * x = 6

Therefore, the manufacturer worked for 6 hours to produce 48 watches.

3. This means that the total number of pieces is a multiple of 9, and when divided by 9, the result is 11.
4. In mathematical terms, we can write this as:
   * Total pieces ÷ 9 = 11
   * Or, Total pieces = 11 × 9

Now, let's calculate:
* Total pieces = 11 × 9
* Total pieces = 99

Therefore, there are 99 pieces in the puzzle.

1) We know that each bear stands 8 feet tall.

2) We also know that the total height of all bears standing together is 8 feet.

3) If we let 'x' be the number of bears, then we can write an equation:
   
   8x = 8

   This equation means: the height of each bear (8 feet) multiplied by the number of bears (x) equals the total height of all bears (8 feet).

4) Now, we can solve for x:
   
   8x = 8
   x = 8/8 = 1

Therefore, there is only 1 bear.

1. We know that the entire song lasts for 90 seconds.
2. The song contains 10 verses.
3. Each verse takes the same amount of time.

To find the duration of each verse, we need to divide the total duration of the song by the number of verses.

Duration of each verse = Total duration of the song ÷ Number of verses
Duration of each verse = 90 seconds ÷ 10
Duration of each verse = &lt;&lt;90/10=9&gt;&gt;9 seconds

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* There are 10 bracelets made by one craftsman.
* Each craftsman made the same number of bracelets.
* There is 1 bracelet per craftsman displayed in the showroom.

To find out how many craftsmen's work is displayed in the showroom, we need to determine the total number of bracelets in the store.

If one craftsman made 10 bracelets, and each craftsman made the same number of bracelets, then the total number of bracelets is equal to the number of craftsmen multiplied by 10.

Let's call the number of craftsmen 'x'.

Total number of bracelets = Number of craftsmen × Bracelets per craftsman
x × 1 = x

Since there is 1 bracelet per craftsman displayed in the showroom, the number of craftsmen's work displayed is equal to the total number of craftsmen, which is 'x'.

Therefore, the number of craftsmen's work displayed in the showroom is equal to the total number of bracelets in the store divided by the number of bracelets made by one craftsman.

Number of craftsmen's work displayed = Total number of bracelets ÷ Bracelets made by one craftsman
x = x × 10 ÷ 10
x = x

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James has a total of 12 toy cars in his collection.
   * Each type of car he has comes in pairs (which means he has 2 of each type).

2. To find the number of types of toy cars, we need to divide the total number of cars by the number of cars in each pair:
   * Number of types = Total number of cars ÷ Number of cars in each pair
   * Number of types = 12 ÷ 2
   * Number of types = 6

Therefore, James has 6 different types of toy cars in his collection.

2. Set up an equation:
   * In 1 minute, the dolphin jumps 5 times.
   * In 'p' minutes, the dolphin jumps 60 times.
   * So, we can write: 5 × p = 60

3. Solve the equation for 'p':
   * Divide both sides by 5:
     5 × p = 60
     p = 60 ÷ 5
     p = &lt;&lt;60/5=12&gt;&gt;12

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Each pack contains 9 pens.
   * There are 9 packs in the store.

2. To find the total number of pens in the store, we need to multiply the number of pens in each pack by the number of packs:
   * Total pens = Pens per pack × Number of packs
   * Total pens = 9 × 9
   * Total pens = 81

Therefore, there are 81 pens in the store.

        A tiger has 4 pounds of meat for his meal today. If one serving size is an eighth of a pound, then how many servings are in the tiger's meal?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that the tiger has 4 pounds of meat for his meal.
2. One serving size is 1/8 (one-eighth) of a pound.
3. To find the number of servings, we need to divide the total amount of meat by the serving size.

Number of servings = Total amount of meat ÷ Serving size
Number of servings = 4 ÷ (1/8)

4. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 1/8 is 8/1 (or simply 8).

Number of servings = 4 × 8 = 32

Therefore, there are 32 servings in the tiger's meal.

* The astronaut has 88 hours of oxygen in his tank.
* He can use this tank for 8 days.

We need to find out how many hours of oxygen the tank provides each day.

Reasoning:
1. To find the number of hours of oxygen the tank provides each day, we need to divide the total hours of oxygen by the number of days.
2. Total hours of oxygen = 88 hours
3. Number of days = 8 days
4. Hours of oxygen per day = Total hours of oxygen ÷ Number of days
5. Hours of oxygen per day = 88 ÷ 8 = 11

Therefore, the tank provides 11 hours of oxygen each day.
