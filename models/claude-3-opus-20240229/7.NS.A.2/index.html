        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the product of (29/2) and (19/28), we multiply the numerators and denominators separately, then simplify the resulting fraction.

(29/2) Ã— (19/28) = (29 Ã— 19) / (2 Ã— 28)

Multiply the numerators: 29 Ã— 19 = 551
Multiply the denominators: 2 Ã— 28 = 56

Now, we have: 551 / 56

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

The GCF of 551 and 56 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Multiply the numerators: 551 Ã— 8 = 4408
Multiply the denominators: 56 Ã— 28 = 1568

Now, we have: 4408 / 1568

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

            Susan has a recipe that calls for 30 parts of flour to 27 parts of water. If she decides to use 29 parts of flour instead, and she keeps the water proportion the same, how much water will she use? Calculate this using fraction multiplication: ((30 / 30) * (29 / 27)).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step using fraction multiplication.

Given:
- The original recipe calls for 30 parts of flour to 27 parts of water.
- Susan decides to use 29 parts of flour instead.

Step 1: Set up the fraction multiplication.
(30 / 30) Ã— (29 / 27)

Step 2: Simplify the first fraction.
(30 / 30) = 1
1 Ã— (29 / 27)

Step 3: Multiply the numerators and denominators.
(1 Ã— 29) / (1 Ã— 27) = 29 / 27

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
29 and 27 have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, if Susan uses 29 parts of flour and keeps the water proportion the same, she will use 29/27 parts of water.

To convert the fraction to a decimal, divide 29 by 27:
29 Ã· 27 â‰ˆ 1.074

This means Susan will use approximately 1.074 parts of water for every 1 part of flour.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step using fraction multiplication.

Given:
- Susan made 23/4 batches of her recipe.
- The original recipe calls for 30 parts of flour to 27 parts of water.
- Susan decides to use 29 parts of flour instead.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water needed for 1 batch using the modified recipe.
(30 / 30) Ã— (29 / 27) = 29 / 27

Step 2: Set up the fraction multiplication to find the amount of water needed for 23/4 batches.
(23 / 4) Ã— (29 / 27)

Step 3: Multiply the numerators and denominators.
(23 Ã— 29) / (4 Ã— 27) = 667 / 108

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
667 and 108 have a common factor of 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, if Susan made 23/4 batches of her recipe using 29 parts of flour, she would use 667/108 parts of water.

To convert the fraction to a mixed number:
667 Ã· 108 = 6 with a remainder of 19
19/108 cannot be simplified further.

So, 667/108 = 6 19/108

Given:
- Susan decides to use 30 parts of flour out of an available 12.
- She keeps the water proportion the same.

Step 1: Set up the fraction multiplication.
(30 / 12) Ã— (29 / 27)

Step 2: Multiply the numerators and denominators.
(30 Ã— 29) / (12 Ã— 27) = 870 / 324

Step 3: Simplify the fraction if possible.
870 and 324 have a common factor of 6.
(870 Ã· 6) / (324 Ã· 6) = 145 / 54

The fraction 145/54 cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, if Susan uses 30 parts of flour out of an available 12 and keeps the water proportion the same, she will use 145/54 parts of water.

To convert the fraction to a decimal, divide 145 by 54:
145 Ã· 54 â‰ˆ 2.685

This means Susan will use approximately 2.685 parts of water for every 1 part of flour.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To divide 25/4 by 16/6, we can use the following steps:

1. Invert the divisor (16/6) and multiply it by the dividend (25/4).
2. Simplify the resulting fraction.

Step 1: (25/4) Ã· (16/6) = (25/4) Ã— (6/16)

Step 2: (25/4) Ã— (6/16) = (25 Ã— 6) / (4 Ã— 16) = 150 / 64

Now, let's simplify 150/64:
Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2.

150 Ã· 2 = 75
64 Ã· 2 = 32

The simplified fraction is 75/32.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, we'll divide 25/4 by 16/6 (as we did in the previous question):
   (25/4) Ã· (16/6) = (25/4) Ã— (6/16) = 150/64 = 75/32

2. Now, we'll multiply the result (75/32) by 19/6:
   (75/32) Ã— (19/6) = (75 Ã— 19) / (32 Ã— 6)
                    = 1425 / 192

3. To simplify 1425/192 to lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 1425 and 192:
   The factors of 1425 are 1, 3, 5, 15, 19, 25, 57, 75, 95, 285, 475, and 1425.
   The factors of 192 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, and 192.
   The greatest common factor is 3.

4. Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF (3):
   (1425/3) / (192/3) = 475 / 64

Therefore, the simplified result is 475/64.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this new scenario, we are dividing 9 by 16/6. To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the whole number 9 into a fraction by putting it over 1.
2. Invert the divisor (16/6) and multiply it by the dividend (9/1).
3. Simplify the resulting fraction.

Step 1: 9 = 9/1

Step 2: (9/1) Ã· (16/6) = (9/1) Ã— (6/16)

Step 3: (9/1) Ã— (6/16) = (9 Ã— 6) / (1 Ã— 16) = 54 / 16

Now, let's simplify 54/16:
Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2.

54 Ã· 2 = 27
16 Ã· 2 = 8

The simplified fraction is 27/8.

Therefore, ((9 / 19) * (19 / 6)) = 3/2 or 1 1/2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately, then simplify the resulting fraction if possible.

(19/12) * (20/6)

Multiply the numerators: 19 * 20 = 380
Multiply the denominators: 12 * 6 = 72

The resulting fraction is 380/72.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 380 and 72.

The factors of 380 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 19, 20, 38, 76, 95, 190, 380
The factors of 72 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72

The greatest common divisor of 380 and 72 is 4.

Divide both the numerator and denominator by 4:
380 Ã· 4 = 95
72 Ã· 4 = 18

The simplified fraction is 95/18.

Multiply the denominators: 18 * 18 = 324

The resulting fraction is 9025/324.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9025 and 324.

The greatest common divisor of 9025 and 324 is 81.

Divide both the numerator and denominator by 81:

            A cargo ship carries 28/21 of its capacity in the morning, and 22/4 of its capacity in the afternoon. If the cargo in the morning represents the load allocated to consumer goods and the cargo in the afternoon represents industrial supplies, what is the total fractional representation of these two types of cargo hauled in one day? Calculate ((28 / 21) * (22 / 4)). Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The cargo ship carries 28/21 of its capacity in the morning (consumer goods).
2. The cargo ship carries 22/4 of its capacity in the afternoon (industrial supplies).
3. We need to calculate the total fractional representation of these two types of cargo hauled in one day.

To find the total fractional representation, we need to multiply the two fractions:

(28 / 21) * (22 / 4)

First, let's multiply the numerators:
28 * 22 = 616

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
21 * 4 = 84

Now, we have:
616 / 84

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 616 and 84.
The GCD of 616 and 84 is 28.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 28, we get:
(616 / 28) / (84 / 28) = 22 / 3

Therefore, the total fractional representation of consumer goods and industrial supplies hauled in one day is 22/3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's continue from the previous answer:

1. The total fractional representation of consumer goods and industrial supplies hauled in one day is 22/3.
2. The ship needs to set aside 5/24 of this total fraction for an emergency supply run later in the week.
3. We need to calculate the fraction of the overall cargo that this emergency supply run represents.

To find the fraction of the overall cargo for the emergency supply run, we need to multiply the two fractions:

(5 / 24) * (22 / 3)

First, let's multiply the numerators:
5 * 22 = 110

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
24 * 3 = 72

Now, we have:
110 / 72

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 110 and 72.
The GCD of 110 and 72 is 2.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get:
(110 / 2) / (72 / 2) = 55 / 36

Therefore, the emergency supply run represents 55/36 of the overall cargo.

1. The cargo ship now carries 29/21 of its capacity in the morning (consumer goods).
2. The cargo ship still carries 22/4 of its capacity in the afternoon (industrial supplies).
3. We need to calculate the new total fractional representation of these two types of cargo hauled in one day.

To find the new total fractional representation, we need to multiply the two fractions:

(29 / 21) * (22 / 4)

First, let's multiply the numerators:
29 * 22 = 638

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
21 * 4 = 84

Now, we have:
638 / 84

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 638 and 84.
The GCD of 638 and 84 is 2.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get:
(638 / 2) / (84 / 2) = 319 / 42

To further simplify, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 7:
(319 / 7) / (42 / 7) = 29 / 6

Therefore, the new total fractional representation of consumer goods and industrial supplies hauled in one day is 29/6.

Now, let's multiply this result by the fraction (23 / 22).

(285 / 91) * (23 / 22)

Multiply the numerators: 285 * 23 = 6555
Multiply the denominators: 91 * 22 = 2002

The resulting fraction is 6555 / 2002.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6555 and 2002.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
6555 = 3 * 2002 + 549
2002 = 3 * 549 + 355
549 = 1 * 355 + 194
355 = 1 * 194 + 161
194 = 1 * 161 + 33
161 = 4 * 33 + 29
33 = 1 * 29 + 4
29 = 7 * 4 + 1
4 = 4 * 1 + 0

The GCD of 6555 and 2002 is 1.

   (10 / 25) * 5 = (10 * 5) / 25 = 50 / 25

3. Simplify the fraction 50 / 25:
   Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
   The GCF of 50 and 25 is 25.
   (50 / 25) / (25 / 25) = 2 / 1 = 2

Therefore, (10 / 25) * (20 / 4) = 2.

The difference between this result and the previous one is:
- In the previous problem, (12 / 25) * (20 / 4) = 12 / 5
- In this problem, (10 / 25) * (20 / 4) = 2

The difference is due to the change in the numerator of the first fraction from 12 to 10. This change results in a different simplified fraction. In the first case, the fraction simplifies to 12 / 5, while in the second case, it simplifies to 2 / 1 or simply 2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1) We know that the baker needs 26 cups of sugar for a full batch.
2) The baker only has enough sugar to make 29/14 of a full batch.
3) We need to calculate ((26 / 1) / (29 / 14)).

First, let's simplify 29/14:
29/14 = 29/14 Ã· 7/7 = 29/2 = 14.5

Now, let's calculate ((26 / 1) / (29 / 14)):
((26 / 1) / (29 / 14)) = (26 / 1) / 14.5
                       = 26 / 14.5
                       = 26 Ã· 14.5
                       = 1.793103448...

To write this as a simplified fraction, we need to divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor:
26 = 2 * 13
145 = 5 * 29
The greatest common factor is 1.

So, the simplified fraction is 26/145.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate the expression (27 / 10) * (9 / 4), we can follow the order of operations and multiply the fractions.

Step 1: Multiply the numerators and denominators separately.
(27 / 10) * (9 / 4) = (27 * 9) / (10 * 4)

Step 2: Simplify the numerator and denominator.
(27 * 9) / (10 * 4) = 243 / 40

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 243 and 40 is 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 243 / 40.

Now, we have:
(24 / 11) * (27 / 26) = 648 / 286

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

The GCF of 648 and 286 is 2.

4. Multiply the numerators and denominators:

                      = 1330 / 624

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 1330 and 624:

1330 = 2 * 5 * 7 * 19
624 = 2 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 13

The GCF of 1330 and 624 is 2.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:

(1330 / 2) / (624 / 2) = 665 / 312

The fraction 665 / 312 cannot be simplified further as 665 and 312 have no common factors other than 1.

Given:
- Instead of multiplying (15 / 3) by (19 / 26), we are now multiplying it by (27 / 26).

Step 1: Simplify (15 / 3).
15 / 3 = 5

Step 2: Multiply the simplified fraction (5) by (27 / 26).
(5) * (27 / 26) = (5 * 27) / 26 = 135 / 26

Step 3: Simplify the resulting fraction (135 / 26).
135 and 26 have a common factor of 1, but we can simplify this further.
Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
GCF of 135 and 26 is 1.
(135 / 1) / (26 / 1) = 135 / 26

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 135 / 26.

1. The recipe requires 19/28 of an ingredient.
2. The bakery wants to make 30/4 times the recipe.

To find out how much of the ingredient they need, we multiply the amount required in the recipe by the number of times they are making the recipe:

19/28 Ã— 30/4

First, let's simplify 30/4:
30/4 = 15/2 (dividing both numerator and denominator by 2)

Now, let's multiply 19/28 by 15/2:
19/28 Ã— 15/2 = (19 Ã— 15) / (28 Ã— 2) (multiply numerators and denominators)
            = 285 / 56 (multiply the numerators and denominators)
            = 5 5/56 (divide 285 by 56 to get the mixed number)

Given:
- The new recipe requires 19/14 of the ingredient for a single cake.

Step 1: Simplify 30/4.
30/4 = 15/2 (dividing both numerator and denominator by 2)

Step 2: Multiply the new recipe amount (19/14) by the number of times the recipe is needed (15/2).
19/14 Ã— 15/2 = (19 Ã— 15) / (14 Ã— 2) (multiply numerators and denominators)

2. Now, divide the simplified fractions:

3. To divide fractions, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction:

   (9/3) * (27/28) = (9 * 27) / (3 * 28)
                   = 243 / 84

2. Now, let's simplify the fraction 243/84.
   To simplify, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 243 and 84.
   Using the Euclidean algorithm:
   243 = 2 * 84 + 75
   84 = 1 * 75 + 9
   75 = 8 * 9 + 3
   9 = 3 * 3 + 0
   
   The GCD is 3.

3. Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD (3).

To simplify this fraction, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6561 and 784.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
6561 = 8 * 784 + 289
784 = 2 * 289 + 206
289 = 1 * 206 + 83
206 = 2 * 83 + 40
83 = 2 * 40 + 3

1. Multiply the fractions (9/3) and (23/28).
   (9/3) * (23/28) = (9 * 23) / (3 * 28)
                   = 207 / 84

2. Simplify the fraction 207/84.
   To simplify, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 207 and 84.
   Using the Euclidean algorithm:
   207 = 2 * 84 + 39
   84 = 2 * 39 + 6
   39 = 6 * 6 + 3
   6 = 2 * 3 + 0
   
   The GCD is 3.

3. Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD (3).
   (207/3) / (84/3) = 69 / 28

Therefore, (9/3) * (23/28) simplifies to 69/28.

Comparing this result to the previous problem:
- Previously, (9/3) * (27/28) simplified to 81/28.

(9 / 7) * (25 / 30) = (225 / 210)

Now, let's simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

The GCF of 225 and 210 is 15.

(225 / 15) / (210 / 15) = 15 / 14

Multiply the denominators: 14 * 15 = 210

(15 / 14) * (15 / 15) = (225 / 210)

Now, let's simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

The GCF of 225 and 210 is 15.

(225 / 15) / (210 / 15) = 15 / 14

Therefore, (15 / 14) * (15 / 15) = 15 / 14, which is the same as the original fraction.

This is because multiplying a fraction by 15 / 15 (which equals 1) does not change the value of the fraction.

(9 / 7) * (25 / 21) = (225 / 147)

Now, let's simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

The GCF of 225 and 147 is 3.

(225 / 3) / (147 / 3) = 75 / 49

1. Simplify (20 / 2):
   20 / 2 = 10

2. Now, multiply the simplified fraction (10) by (15 / 18):
   (10) * (15 / 18) = (10 * 15) / 18

3. Simplify the fraction 150 / 18 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF):
   The GCF of 150 and 18 is 6.

            After considering the previous problem, there is a slight change. Instead of multiplying (5/3) by (27/13), let's make it a little easy and multiply (5/3) by (27/9). Calculate the new solution and write your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Alright, let's calculate the solution for the new expression (5 / 3) * (27 / 9) and simplify the resulting fraction.

(5 / 3) * (27 / 9) = (5 * 27) / (3 * 9)
                   = 135 / 27

To simplify the fraction 135 / 27, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 135 and 27.

The factors of 135 are: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 27, 45, 135
The factors of 27 are: 1, 3, 9, 27

The greatest common divisor of 135 and 27 is 27.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 27:

(135 / 27) / (27 / 27) = 5 / 1

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 5 / 1, which can be written as 5.

11/19 Ã— 22/7

Multiply the numerators: 11 Ã— 22 = 242
Multiply the denominators: 19 Ã— 7 = 133

The product is 242/133.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 242 and 133.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
242 = 1 Ã— 133 + 109
133 = 1 Ã— 109 + 24
109 = 4 Ã— 24 + 13
24 = 1 Ã— 13 + 11
13 = 1 Ã— 11 + 2
11 = 5 Ã— 2 + 1

The GCD of 242 and 133 is 1, so the fraction 242/133 is already in its simplest form.

Now, let's multiply 242/133 by 25/4:

Multiply the numerators: 242 Ã— 25 = 6050
Multiply the denominators: 133 Ã— 4 = 532

The result is 6050/532.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6050 and 532.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
6050 = 11 Ã— 532 + 198
532 = 2 Ã— 198 + 136
198 = 1 Ã— 136 + 62
136 = 2 Ã— 62 + 12
62 = 5 Ã— 12 + 2
12 = 6 Ã— 2 + 0

The GCD of 6050 and 532 is 2.

Divide both the numerator and denominator by 2:

To find the product of 11/19 and 25/7, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately, then simplify the resulting fraction if possible.

11/19 Ã— 25/7

Multiply the numerators: 11 Ã— 25 = 275
Multiply the denominators: 19 Ã— 7 = 133

The product is 275/133.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 275 and 133.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
275 = 2 Ã— 133 + 9
133 = 14 Ã— 9 + 7
9 = 1 Ã— 7 + 2
7 = 3 Ã— 2 + 1

The GCD of 275 and 133 is 1, so the fraction 275/133 is already in its simplest form.

21/30 * 19/5 = (21 * 19) / (30 * 5)

To simplify 399/150, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 399 and 150.

The factors of 399 are: 1, 3, 7, 19, 21, 57, 133, 399

The greatest common factor of 399 and 150 is 3.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3:

               = 2128 / 600

To simplify 2128/600, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 2128 and 600.

1582 = 19 * 81 + 43
81 = 1 * 43 + 38
43 = 1 * 38 + 5
38 = 7 * 5 + 3
5 = 1 * 3 + 2
3 = 1 * 2 + 1
2 = 2 * 1 + 0

The GCD of 64009 and 14400 is 1.

Since the GCD is 1, the fraction 64009/14400 cannot be simplified further.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's multiply the fractions 11/15 and 26/8.

11/15 * 26/8

Multiply the numerators: 11 * 26 = 286
Multiply the denominators: 15 * 8 = 120

The resulting fraction is 286/120.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 286 and 120.

The factors of 286 are 1, 2, 11, 13, 22, 26, 143, and 286.
The factors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

The greatest common divisor of 286 and 120 is 2.

To simplify the fraction, divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD:

286 Ã· 2 = 143
120 Ã· 2 = 60

The simplified fraction is 143/60.

Multiply the numerators: 29 * 21 = 609
Multiply the denominators: 16 * 27 = 432

Now, we have: 609 / 432

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 609 and 432.

The factors of 609 are: 1, 3, 7, 21, 29, 87, 203, 609
The factors of 432 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 36, 48, 54, 72, 108, 144, 216, 432

The greatest common factor of 609 and 432 is 3.

1. First, let's simplify the fraction 30/27:
   30/27 = 10/9 (divide both numerator and denominator by 3)

2. Now, we have (28/1) Ã· (10/9). When dividing fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction:
   (28/1) Ã· (10/9) = (28/1) Ã— (9/10)

3. Multiply the numerators and denominators:
   (28 Ã— 9) / (1 Ã— 10) = 252 / 10

4. Simplify the fraction:
   252/10 = 126/5 (divide both numerator and denominator by 2)

To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and denominators separately:

            Suppose you initially started with 30 (instead of 5), which is equivalent to the fraction 30/1. You are then required to multiply this with the fraction 16/27. How does this change the result from the previous problem? Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this case, we start with 30 (which is equivalent to 30/1) and multiply it with the fraction 16/27.

1. Multiply the numerators: 30 Ã— 16 = 480
2. Multiply the denominators: 1 Ã— 27 = 27
3. The resulting fraction is 480/27

Now, let's simplify the fraction 480/27:

4. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 480 and 27.
   - The factors of 480 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 32, 40, 48, 60, 80, 96, 120, 160, 240, 480
   - The factors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, 27
   - The greatest common factor is 3

5. Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD (3):
   - 480 Ã· 3 = 160
   - 27 Ã· 3 = 9

6. The simplified fraction is 160/9

Compared to the previous problem, the result is 6 times larger (160/9 = 6 Ã— 80/27) because we started with 30 instead of 5, and 30 is 6 times larger than 5.

b = (9 * 21) / (1 * 17)
b = 189 / 17

1. Simplify the fraction inside the parentheses:

2. Now, the expression becomes:

3. Dividing 24 by 1 gives us 24.

4. The simplified fraction of 24 is 24/1.

Now, let's compare this result with the previous answer 's' which was 9/1.

The change from 27 to 24 in the numerator of the original expression results in a different answer. Instead of 9/1, we now have 24/1.

The effect of this change on the answer 's' is that it is multiplied by 8/9. We can see this by comparing the two answers:

24/1 = (8/9) * (9/1) = (8/9) * s

So, the new answer is 8/9 times the original answer 's'.

2. Multiply the denominators: 32 * 18 = 576
3. The result is 7830 / 576

Now, let's simplify the fraction 7830 / 576:

4. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7830 and 576:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, let's divide 18 by 4:
   18 Ã· 4 = 4.5
   This can also be written as a fraction: 18/4 = 9/2

2. Next, let's divide 10 by 11:
   10 Ã· 11 = 0.909090...
   As a fraction, this is: 10/11

3. Now, let's multiply the results from steps 1 and 2:
   (9/2) Ã— (10/11) = 90/22

4. Finally, let's simplify the fraction 90/22:
   90 Ã· 2 = 45
   22 Ã· 2 = 11
   So, 90/22 simplifies to 45/11.

1. The previous result was 45/11.

2. Now, we need to multiply this result by the fraction 6/4:
   (45/11) Ã— (6/4)

3. To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately:
   (45 Ã— 6) / (11 Ã— 4) = 270 / 44

4. Let's simplify the fraction 270/44:
   270 Ã· 2 = 135
   44 Ã· 2 = 22
   So, 270/44 simplifies to 135/22

5. We can further simplify 135/22:
   135 Ã· 5 = 27
   22 Ã· 5 = 4.4 (which is not an integer, so we stop here)
   
Therefore, the final simplified fraction is 27/4.

1. First, let's divide 18 by 1:

2. Next, let's divide 10 by 11 (this step remains the same as before):
   10 Ã· 11 = 0.909090...
   As a fraction, this is: 10/11

3. Now, let's multiply the results from steps 1 and 2:
   (18/1) Ã— (10/11) = 180/11

4. Finally, let's simplify the fraction 180/11:

(24/23) * (23/3) = (24 * 23) / (23 * 3)

First, let's multiply the numerators:
24 * 23 = 552

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
23 * 3 = 69

Now, we have:
552 / 69

To simplify this fraction, we need to divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). The GCF of 552 and 69 is 3.

(552 / 3) / (69 / 3) = 184 / 23

Reciprocal of (17 / 16) = 16 / 17

Step 2: Multiply (20 / 13) by (16 / 17)
(20 / 13) Ã— (16 / 17) = (20 Ã— 16) / (13 Ã— 17) = 320 / 221

Step 3: Simplify the fraction 320 / 221
Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 320 and 221 is 1, so the fraction cannot be simplified further.

Step 2: Simplify the fraction 6400 / 5746
Divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 6400 and 5746 is 2.

(6400 / 2) / (5746 / 2) = 3200 / 2873

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate the expression (23 / 26) * (16 / 1), we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately, then simplify the resulting fraction.

(23 / 26) * (16 / 1) = (23 * 16) / (26 * 1)
                     = 368 / 26

To simplify the fraction 368 / 26, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.

The factors of 368 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 23, 46, 92, 184, 368
The factors of 26 are: 1, 2, 13, 26

The GCF of 368 and 26 is 2.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:

368 / 26 = (368 / 2) / (26 / 2)
         = 184 / 13

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 184 / 13.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous question, we found that (23 / 26) * (16 / 1) = 184 / 13. Let's call this value 'g'.

Now, we need to find the value of (4 / 7) * g.

Substituting the value of 'g':

(4 / 7) * g = (4 / 7) * (184 / 13)

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately:

(4 / 7) * (184 / 13) = (4 * 184) / (7 * 13)
                     = 736 / 91

To simplify the fraction 736 / 91, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.

The factors of 736 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 23, 32, 46, 92, 184, 368, 736
The factors of 91 are: 1, 7, 13, 91

The GCF of 736 and 91 is 1, so the fraction 736 / 91 is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, (4 / 7) * g = 736 / 91.

Let's evaluate the expression (2 / 26) * (16 / 1) by multiplying the numerators and denominators separately, then simplify the resulting fraction.

(2 / 26) * (16 / 1) = (2 * 16) / (26 * 1)
                    = 32 / 26

To simplify the fraction 32 / 26, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.

The factors of 32 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32
The factors of 26 are: 1, 2, 13, 26

The GCF of 32 and 26 is 2.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2:

32 / 26 = (32 / 2) / (26 / 2)
        = 16 / 13

Therefore, the simplified fraction for (2 / 26) * (16 / 1) is 16 / 13.

3. Now, we have (21 / (13 / 10)). To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:
   21 / (13 / 10) = 21 * (10 / 13)

4. Multiply the numerators and denominators:
   (21 * 10) / 13 = 210 / 13

5. Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF):

1. Simplify 19 / 3:

2. Simplify 8 / 15:
   8 / 15 = 8/15 (already in simplified form)

3. Multiply the simplified fractions:
   (6 1/3) * (8/15)
   = (6 + 1/3) * (8/15)
   = (6 * 8/15) + (1/3 * 8/15)

4. Find a common denominator for 16/5 and 8/45:
   The common denominator is 45.
   16/5 = 144/45

5. Add the fractions with the common denominator:
   144/45 + 8/45 = 152/45

6. Simplify the resulting fraction:
   152/45 = 3 17/45
   = 3 + 17/45
   = 3 + 17/(3*15)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the result of the expression (19 / 7) * (8 / 15), we can follow these steps:

1. Simplify 19 / 7:
   19 / 7 = 2 5/7

2. Simplify 8 / 15:
   8 / 15 = 8/15 (already in simplified form)

3. Multiply the simplified fractions:
   (2 5/7) * (8/15)
   = (2 + 5/7) * (8/15)
   = (2 * 8/15) + (5/7 * 8/15)
   = 16/15 + 40/105
   = 16/15 + 8/21

4. Find a common denominator for 16/15 and 8/21:
   The common denominator is 105.
   16/15 = 112/105

5. Add the fractions with the common denominator:
   112/105 + 8/21
   = 112/105 + 40/105
   = 152/105

6. Simplify the resulting fraction:
   152/105 = 1 47/105
   = 1 + 47/105
   = 1 + 47/(3*35)
   = 1 + 47/105
   
Therefore, the simplified fraction is 1 47/105.

Multiply the numerators and denominators:

Simplify the resulting fraction:
196 and 80 have a common factor of 4.
(196 / 4) / (80 / 4) = 49 / 20

Simplify further:
49 and 20 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this new scenario, we have (13 / 3) instead of (15 / 3). Let's calculate the result of (13 / 3) * (7 / 25) and simplify the answer:

1. Simplify (13 / 3):
   13 / 3 cannot be simplified further as 13 and 3 have no common factors other than 1.

2. Simplify (7 / 25):
   7 / 25 is already in its simplest form.

3. Multiply the fractions:
   (13 / 3) * (7 / 25) = (13 * 7) / (3 * 25) = 91 / 75

4. Simplify the resulting fraction:
   91 and 75 have no common factors other than 1, so 91 / 75 is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the simplified result of (13 / 3) * (7 / 25) is 91 / 75.

Comparing this result to the previous scenario:
- In the previous scenario, (15 / 3) * (7 / 25) = 7 / 5 = 1.4
- In the new scenario, (13 / 3) * (7 / 25) = 91 / 75 â‰ˆ 1.213

The change in the numerator from 15 to 13 affects the final result. The new result (91 / 75) is slightly smaller than the previous result (7 / 5). This is because 13 is smaller than 15, so (13 / 3) is smaller than (15 / 3), resulting in a smaller product when multiplied by (7 / 25).

Now, we need to evaluate z by multiplying x with the fraction (19 / 15).

z = 20 * (19 / 15)

To simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately:
z = (20 * 19) / (1 * 15)
z = 380 / 15

To simplify the fraction 380 / 15, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). The GCF of 380 and 15 is 5.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the value of the expression ((29 / 17) / (27 / 22)), we can follow these steps:

1. First, simplify the fractions 29/17 and 27/22:
   29/17 cannot be simplified further.
   27/22 = (27/3) / (22/3) = 9/22 = 9/(2*11) = 9/2 * 1/11 = (9/2) * (1/11)

2. Now, we have the expression ((29/17) / ((9/2) * (1/11))).

3. To divide fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction:
   (29/17) / ((9/2) * (1/11)) = (29/17) * ((2/9) * (11/1))

4. Simplify the multiplication:
   (29/17) * ((2/9) * (11/1)) = (29/17) * (22/9) = (29*22) / (17*9) = 638 / 153

5. Simplify the fraction 638/153:
   638/153 = (2*11*29) / (3*3*17) = (2*11) / (3*3) * (29/17) = 22/9 * 29/17

Therefore, the simplified fraction is:

From the previous question, we know that (27 / 6) * (25 / 5) = 22.5

Now, we need to multiply 22.5 by (20 / 27).

22.5 * (20 / 27) = (22.5 * 20) / 27
                = 450 / 27
                = 16.6666... (rounded to 16.67)

Therefore, the outcome of multiplying the result of (27 / 6) * (25 / 5) by (20 / 27) is approximately 16.67.

1. Calculate 11 / 6:

2. We already know that 25 / 5 = 5 from the previous problem.

3. Now, multiply the results from steps 1 and 2:

Multiply the numerators:

Multiply the denominators:

Now, we have:

To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator:
GCF(1100, 624) = 8

Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF:

To further simplify, we find the GCF of 275 and 156:

(55/24) Ã— (20/26) = (55 Ã— 20) / (24 Ã— 26) = 1100 / 624

Simplifying this fraction:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately, then simplify the resulting fraction if possible.

15/16 * 29/27 = (15 * 29) / (16 * 27)

First, let's multiply the numerators:
15 * 29 = 435

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
16 * 27 = 432

Now, we have:
435 / 432

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 435 and 432.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
435 = 1 * 432 + 3
432 = 144 * 3 + 0

The GCD is 3.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3:
(435 / 3) / (432 / 3) = 145 / 144

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 145/144.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we found that 15/16 * 29/27 = 145/144.

Now, we need to multiply 145/144 by 27/4.

145/144 * 27/4 = (145 * 27) / (144 * 4)

First, let's multiply the numerators:
145 * 27 = 3915

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
144 * 4 = 576

Now, we have:
3915 / 576

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3915 and 576.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
3915 = 6 * 576 + 459
576 = 1 * 459 + 117
459 = 3 * 117 + 108
117 = 1 * 108 + 9
108 = 12 * 9 + 0

The GCD is 9.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 9:
(3915 / 9) / (576 / 9) = 435 / 64

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 435/64.

            In the previous problem, you calculated the multiplication of the fractions 15/16 and 29/27.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's multiply the fractions 15/10 and 29/27 and simplify the result.

15/10 * 29/27 = (15 * 29) / (10 * 27)

First, let's multiply the numerators:
15 * 29 = 435

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
10 * 27 = 270

Now, we have:
435 / 270

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 435 and 270.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
435 = 1 * 270 + 165
270 = 1 * 165 + 105
165 = 1 * 105 + 60
105 = 1 * 60 + 45
60 = 1 * 45 + 15
45 = 3 * 15 + 0

The GCD is 15.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 15:
(435 / 15) / (270 / 15) = 29 / 18

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 29/18.

Comparing this result with the previous problem, we can see that the result is different. In the previous problem, the simplified fraction was 145/144, while in this problem, it is 29/18.

2. Next, let's simplify the fraction 25 / 10:
   25 / 10 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

3. Now, we multiply the simplified fractions:
   1.2 * 2.5 = 3

Therefore, ((30 / 25) * (25 / 10)) = 3

To simplify the answer, we can see that 3 is already in its simplest form as it is a whole number.

To simplify 5 / 3, we need to divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). In this case, the GCF of 5 and 3 is 1, so 5 / 3 is already in its simplest form.

The product is 729/30. Now, let's simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

The GCF of 729 and 30 is 3.

(729 Ã· 3) / (30 Ã· 3) = 243 / 10

243/10 Ã— 9/20 = (243 Ã— 9) / (10 Ã— 20)

To simplify 300 / 208, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 300 and 208.

The factors of 300 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 60, 75, 100, 150, 300

To find the square of 75 / 52, we multiply the fraction by itself:

3. Write the result as a fraction: 280 / 242
4. Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

To find the GCF of 280 and 242, we can use the prime factorization method:
280 = 2^3 * 5 * 7
242 = 2 * 11^2

The GCF is the product of the common prime factors with their lowest exponents: 2

(140 / 121) * (17 / 3)

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately:
(140 * 17) / (121 * 3)

Simplify:
2380 / 363

Now, let's simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

To find the GCF of 2380 and 363, we can use the prime factorization method:
2380 = 2^2 * 5 * 7 * 17
363 = 3 * 11^2

The GCF is the product of the common prime factors with their lowest exponents. In this case, there are no common prime factors, so the GCF is 1.

Therefore, the fraction 2380 / 363 cannot be simplified further.

            Previously, you evaluated ((20 / 22) * (14 / 11)) and multiplied the result by (17/3). Now consider changing the second fraction in the initial multiplication to (14 / 2).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's evaluate the new expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 2)) step by step:

1. Multiply the numerators: 20 * 14 = 280
2. Multiply the denominators: 22 * 2 = 44
3. Write the result as a fraction: 280 / 44
4. Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

To find the GCF of 280 and 44, let's use the prime factorization method:
280 = 2^3 * 5 * 7
44 = 2^2 * 11

The GCF is the product of the common prime factors with their lowest exponents: 2^2 = 4

Now, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 4:
(280 / 4) / (44 / 4) = 70 / 11

The fraction 70 / 11 cannot be simplified further.

The difference between the original expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 11)) and the new expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 2)) is that the denominator of the second fraction has changed from 11 to 2. This change results in a different final value when the expressions are evaluated and simplified.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate ((25 / 8) * (3 / 4)), let's first perform the division operations and then multiply the results.

25 / 8 = 3.125
3 / 4 = 0.75

Now, let's multiply these results:
3.125 * 0.75 = 2.34375

To write this as a simplified fraction, we need to convert the decimal to a fraction:
2.34375 = 2 + 0.34375
0.34375 = 11/32

So, 2.34375 = 2 11/32 = 4/1 * 11/32 = 44/32 = 11/8

The result, 11/8, can be interpreted as a form of division or sharing. It represents 11 parts out of 8 equal parts. In other words, if we have 8 equal parts of something and we take 11 of those parts, we get 11/8.

For example, if we have a cake divided into 8 equal slices and we take 11 of those slices, we would have 11/8 of the cake. This is more than one whole cake, as 11/8 is greater than 1.

First, let's multiply the numerators:

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15,834 and 2,295.

420 = 2 * 186 + 48
186 = 3 * 48 + 42
48 = 1 * 42 + 6
42 = 7 * 6 + 0

The GCD of 420 and 234 is 6.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 6:
(420 / 6) / (234 / 6) = 70 / 39

Therefore, (21 / 26) * (20 / 9) = 70 / 39 in simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's calculate (21 / 26) * (20 / 9) and simplify the result:

(21 / 26) * (20 / 9)
= (21 * 20) / (26 * 9)
= 420 / 234

To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 420 and 234, which is 6.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 6:
(420 / 6) / (234 / 6) = 70 / 39

Now, let's multiply the result (70 / 39) by (15 / 21):

(70 / 39) * (15 / 21)
= (70 * 15) / (39 * 21)
= 1050 / 819

To simplify this fraction, we find the GCD of 1050 and 819, which is 21.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 21:
(1050 / 21) / (819 / 21) = 50 / 39

Therefore, the final result of (21 / 26) * (20 / 9) * (15 / 21) in simplest form is 50 / 39.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 420 and 104.

104 = 26 * 4 + 0

The GCD of 420 and 104 is 4.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4:

1. First, let's multiply the numerators: 17 * 15 = 255
2. Now, let's multiply the denominators: 13 * 6 = 78
3. The resulting fraction is 255 / 78

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 255 and 78.

4. The factors of 255 are: 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 51, 85, 255
5. The factors of 78 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 26, 39, 78
6. The greatest common factor of 255 and 78 is 3

Now, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 3 to simplify the fraction.

Now, we need to multiply (85 / 26) by (8 / 15).

1. Multiply the numerators: 85 * 8 = 680
2. Multiply the denominators: 26 * 15 = 390
3. The resulting fraction is 680 / 390

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 680 and 390.

4. The factors of 680 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 17, 20, 34, 40, 68, 85, 136, 170, 340, 680

Multiply the numerators:
25 * 17 = 425

Multiply the denominators:
18 * 6 = 108

Now, we have:
(25 / 18) * (17 / 6) = 425 / 108

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 425 and 108.

The factors of 425 are: 1, 5, 17, 25, 85, 425
The factors of 108 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, 108

The greatest common divisor of 425 and 108 is 17.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's calculate the result of (15 / 14) * (19 / 14) and simplify the fraction:

1. Multiply the numerators: 15 * 19 = 285
2. Multiply the denominators: 14 * 14 = 196
3. Write the result as a fraction: 285 / 196
4. Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

To find the GCF of 285 and 196, let's use the Euclidean algorithm:
285 = 1 * 196 + 89
196 = 2 * 89 + 18
89 = 4 * 18 + 17
18 = 1 * 17 + 1
17 = 17 * 1 + 0

The GCF of 285 and 196 is 1. Therefore, the fraction 285 / 196 is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the result of the expression (16 / 5) * (5 / 15), we can follow these steps:

1. First, let's perform the division in the first parentheses: 16 / 5
   16 / 5 = 3.2
   
2. Next, let's perform the division in the second parentheses: 5 / 15
   5 / 15 = 1/3
   
3. Now, we can multiply the results from steps 1 and 2:
   3.2 * (1/3) = 3.2/3

4. To simplify this fraction, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 10 to remove the decimal:
   (3.2 * 10) / (3 * 10) = 32 / 30

5. Finally, we can simplify 32/30 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 2:
   (32 / 2) / (30 / 2) = 16 / 15

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 16/15.

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately:

Now, let's simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 120:

(480 / 120) / (360 / 120) = 4 / 3

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We need to calculate the expression (16 / 5) * (5 / 7) and write the answer as a simplified fraction.

1. First, let's perform the division in the first parentheses: 16 / 5
   16 / 5 = 3.2
   
2. Next, let's perform the division in the second parentheses: 5 / 7
   5 / 7 = 0.7142857...
   
3. Now, we can multiply the results from steps 1 and 2:
   3.2 * 0.7142857... = 2.2857142...

4. To write this result as a fraction, we need to find the simplest form. Let's start by writing the decimal as a fraction:
   2.2857142... = 2 + 0.2857142...
                = 2 + 2857142... / 10000000...

5. Now, let's simplify the fraction:
   2857142 / 10000000 = 2857142 / 10000000 (divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 142857)
                      = 20 / 70
                      = 2 / 7

6. Finally, we add the whole number part (2) to the fraction:
   2 + 2/7 = 16/7

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 16/7.

The resulting fraction is 144 / 63.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 144 and 63.

First, let's multiply the numerators:
10 * 25 = 250

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
3 * 26 = 78

Now, we have:
(10 / 3) * (25 / 26) = 250 / 78

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 250 and 78.
The GCD of 250 and 78 is 2.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get:
250 / 2 = 125
78 / 2 = 39

Therefore, the simplified result is:
(10 / 3) * (25 / 26) = 125 / 39

(16 / 6) Ã— (29 / 27) = (16 Ã— 29) / (6 Ã— 27)

First, let's multiply the numerators:
16 Ã— 29 = 464

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
6 Ã— 27 = 162

Now, we have:
(16 / 6) Ã— (29 / 27) = 464 / 162

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 464 and 162.

The factors of 464 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 29, 58, 116, 232, 464
The factors of 162 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54, 81, 162

The greatest common factor of 464 and 162 is 2.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get:
464 / 2 = 232
162 / 2 = 81

16 Ã— 29 = 464

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
6 Ã— 10 = 60

Now, we have:
(16 / 6) Ã— (29 / 10) = 464 / 60

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 464 and 60.

The factors of 464 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 29, 58, 116, 232, 464
The factors of 60 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60

The greatest common factor of 464 and 60 is 4.

            Jeremy realized he made a mistake in his calculations. Instead of multiplying the fraction (15/12) by (27/3) as previously thought, he actually needs to multiply it by (27/5). What is the resulting simplified fraction, now that Jeremy has corrected his mistake?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">No problem, let's help Jeremy solve the problem with the corrected fraction.

Given:
- First fraction: 15/12
- Second fraction: 27/5

Step 1: Multiply the numerators of the fractions.
15 Ã— 27 = 405

Step 2: Multiply the denominators of the fractions.
12 Ã— 5 = 60

Step 3: Write the resulting fraction.
(15/12) Ã— (27/5) = 405/60

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 405 and 60 is 15.
(405 Ã· 15) / (60 Ã· 15) = 27/4

Therefore, (15/12) Ã— (27/5) = 27/4.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Given the previous answer of 1, we now need to multiply it by the fraction 27/15.

1 * (27/15)

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator.

The factors of 27 are: 1, 3, 9, 27
The factors of 15 are: 1, 3, 5, 15

The greatest common divisor of 27 and 15 is 3.

Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD:
(27/3) / (15/3) = 9/5

Therefore, 1 * (27/15) = 9/5

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great question! Let's solve the expression (7 / 7) * (16 / 12) step by step.

1. Simplify (7 / 7):

3. Simplify (16 / 12) by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF):
   The GCF of 16 and 12 is 4.
   (16 / 4) / (12 / 4) = 4 / 3

4. Multiply the simplified fractions:
   1 * (4 / 3) = 4 / 3

5. Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number (optional):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of ((28 / 6) * (16 / 24)), we can follow these steps:

1. Simplify 28 / 6:

2. Simplify 16 / 24:

3. Multiply the simplified fractions:

2. Simplify 16 / 24 (this remains the same as before):
   16 / 24 = 2 / 3 = &lt;&lt;16/24=2/3&gt;&gt;2/3

3. Multiply the simplified fractions:
   (11/3) * (2/3) = (11 * 2) / (3 * 3) = 22 / 9 = &lt;&lt;11/3*2/3=22/9&gt;&gt;22/9
