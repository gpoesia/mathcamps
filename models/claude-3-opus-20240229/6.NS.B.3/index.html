            A window cleaning company charges $533.89 for cleaning the windows of a large building, and this cost is equally shared by 20.3 tenants. How much does each tenant contribute to the window cleaning cost?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to divide the total cost of window cleaning by the number of tenants.

Given:
- The total cost of window cleaning is $533.89.
- The cost is equally shared by 20.3 tenants.

To find the amount each tenant contributes, we divide the total cost by the number of tenants:

Each tenant's contribution = Total cost Ã· Number of tenants
Each tenant's contribution = $533.89 Ã· 20.3
Each tenant's contribution = $26.30

Note: The problem states that there are 20.3 tenants, which is an unusual number of tenants. In reality, there would likely be a whole number of tenants. However, for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the cost is divided equally among 20.3 tenants.

            Previously, the window cleaning cost was divided among the tenants based on a total expense of $533.89. However, it turns out there was a mistake in the billing and the cleaning company only charged $21 for the job. With this adjusted cost, how much would each of the 20.3 tenants need to contribute to the window cleaning cost now?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this updated scenario, we need to recalculate the amount each tenant contributes based on the corrected total cost of $21 for the window cleaning job.

Given:
- The corrected total cost of window cleaning is $21.
- The cost is equally shared by 20.3 tenants.

To find the new amount each tenant contributes, we divide the corrected total cost by the number of tenants:

Each tenant's contribution = Corrected total cost Ã· Number of tenants
Each tenant's contribution = $21 Ã· 20.3
Each tenant's contribution â‰ˆ $1.03

To perform this calculation, we divide 21 by 20.3:
21 Ã· 20.3 â‰ˆ 1.0344827586206897

Rounding this result to the nearest cent gives us approximately $1.03 per tenant.

### Answer: With the adjusted window cleaning cost, each of the 20.3 tenants would need to contribute approximately $1.03.</pre>

Given:
- Each grocery store received 43.5 kilograms of cucumber.
- Each store used 25.3 kilograms of their share for a special cucumber salad.

To find the number of kilograms of cucumber left at each store after making the salad, we subtract the amount used for the salad from the total amount each store received:

43.5 kilograms - 25.3 kilograms = 18.2 kilograms

Therefore, each store had 18.2 kilograms of cucumber left after making the special cucumber salad.

To find the actual amount of wool used, we need to subtract the leftover wool from the initial calculated amount.

Calculation:
Actual wool used = Initial calculated amount - Leftover wool
Actual wool used = 2,751.84 - 87.6 = 2,664.24 grams

* The forest has 70.3 hectares of oak trees.
* Each hectare can absorb 88.8 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

To find the total amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the oak trees in a year, we need to multiply the number of hectares by the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed per hectare.

Total carbon dioxide absorbed = Number of hectares Ã— Carbon dioxide absorbed per hectare
Total carbon dioxide absorbed = 70.3 Ã— 88.8 = &lt;&lt;70.3*88.8=6242.64&gt;&gt;6,242.64 tons

Therefore, the 70.3 hectares of oak trees can absorb 6,242.64 tons of carbon dioxide in a year.

* The forest originally had 70.3 hectares of oak trees.
* Each hectare absorbed 23 tons of carbon dioxide annually.

To calculate the total tons of carbon dioxide absorbed by the oak trees each year, we multiply the number of hectares by the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed per hectare.

Total carbon dioxide absorbed = Number of hectares Ã— Carbon dioxide absorbed per hectare
Total carbon dioxide absorbed = 70.3 Ã— 23 = &lt;&lt;70.3*23=1616.9&gt;&gt;1,616.9 tons

So, if the forest originally had 70.3 hectares of oak trees and each hectare absorbed 23 tons of carbon dioxide annually, the total amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by these hectares of oak trees each year would have been 1,616.9 tons.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of artificial snow produced.

Given:
- The truck was initially carrying a load of 65.4 tons.
- 22 tons were delivered.

Step 1: Subtract the delivered amount from the initial load.
Remaining load = Initial load - Delivered amount
Remaining load = 65.4 - 22 = 43.4 tons

Given:
- 41.98 acres of land are used for growing corn
- 68.1 acres of land are used for growing wheat
- The farm decides to increase their land allocation for crops by a factor of 69.3 times their current allocation

Step 1: Calculate the current total acres of land dedicated to growing crops
Total current acres = Acres used for corn + Acres used for wheat
Total current acres = 41.98 + 68.1 = 110.08 acres

Step 2: Calculate the new total acres of land dedicated to growing crops after the increase
New total acres = Current total acres Ã— Increase factor
New total acres = 110.08 Ã— 69.3 = 7,628.544 acres

Given:
- The cat eats 2 grams of cat food per meal.
- The cat eats 83.54 meals.

Step 1: Multiply the number of grams per meal by the number of meals.
Total grams of cat food = 2 grams/meal Ã— 83.54 meals
Total grams of cat food = 167.08 grams

Calculation:
Wool used = Initial amount of wool - Remaining wool
Wool used = 82.91 - 4.1 = &lt;&lt;82.91-4.1=78.81&gt;&gt;78.81 yards

Given:
- The weaver had 4.1 yards of wool left after weaving the blanket.
- She bought an additional 89.2 yards of wool.

To find the total amount of wool the weaver has now, we need to add the remaining wool and the newly bought wool.

Calculation:
Total wool = Remaining wool + Newly bought wool
Total wool = 4.1 + 89.2 = &lt;&lt;4.1+89.2=93.3&gt;&gt;93.3 yards

Step 1: Add the original total yards of fabric and the additional fabric received.
New total yards of fabric = Original total yards of fabric + Additional fabric received
New total yards of fabric = 94.04 + 46.95
New total yards of fabric = &lt;&lt;94.04+46.95=140.99&gt;&gt;140.99 yards

Given:
- The collector had 146.9 butterfly species after discovering the first new location.
- He discovers an additional 61.65 butterfly species at another location.

Step 1: Add the total number of species from the previous question to the number of newly discovered species.
Updated total species = Previous total species + Newly discovered species
Updated total species = 146.9 + 61.65
Updated total species = 208.55

Therefore, the butterfly collector now has a total of 208.55 butterfly species in his collection.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* The dragon collected a total of 117.02 kg of gold from the two castles.
* The dragon gave away 98.5 kg of gold to its friends.

To find out how much gold the dragon has left, we need to subtract the amount of gold given away from the total amount of gold collected.

Gold left = Total gold collected - Gold given away
Gold left = 117.02 kg - 98.5 kg
Gold left = &lt;&lt;117.02-98.5=18.52&gt;&gt;18.52 kg

Therefore, the dragon has 18.52 kg of gold left after giving away some to its friends.

To calculate the total rainfall, we multiply the daily increase by the number of days:

Total rainfall = Daily increase Ã— Number of days
Total rainfall = 7.97 inches/day Ã— 52.7 days

- The unexpected increase in rainfall was 420.019 inches (calculated in the previous question).

To calculate the total rainfall, we add the predicted rainfall and the unexpected increase:

Total rainfall = Predicted rainfall + Unexpected increase in rainfall
Total rainfall = 72.2 inches + 420.019 inches

Step 1: Calculate the initial total training hours per week.
Initial total training hours per week = Hours practicing routines + Hours working on strength and flexibility
Initial total training hours per week = 20.77 + 73.03 = 93.80 hours

Step 2: Add the additional conditioning hours to the initial total training hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the total amount of cheese produced from the previous question and add the donated cheese to find the total amount of cheese the factory has now.

Given:
- The factory produced 4,564.89 kilograms of cheese over 58.3 days.
- An additional 19.4 kilograms of cheese was donated to the factory.

Step 1: Add the donated cheese to the total amount of cheese produced.
Total cheese = Cheese produced + Donated cheese
Total cheese = 4,564.89 + 19.4 = 4,584.29 kilograms

Therefore, the cheese factory now has a total of 4,584.29 kilograms of cheese.

Given:
- The factory produces 78.3 kilograms of cheese each day.

1. Cost of one box of shorter pencils = $59.88
2. Cost of one box of longer pencils = $88.65
3. Total cost = Cost of shorter pencils + Cost of longer pencils

Given:
- The boat can travel 59.67 miles on 22.1 gallons of fuel.

Step 1: Divide the total distance traveled by the total amount of fuel used.
Miles per gallon = Total distance Ã· Total fuel used
Miles per gallon = 59.67 miles Ã· 22.1 gallons

Step 2: Perform the division.

- The rocket consumes fuel at a rate of 9.5 gallons per minute.

Step 1: Divide the total capacity of the fuel tank by the fuel consumption rate.
Time (in minutes) = Total capacity Ã· Fuel consumption rate

Step 1: Add the time the rocket can fly with a full tank of fuel to the time it was already in flight.
Total flight time = Time with full tank + Time already in flight
Total flight time = 41 minutes + 3.69 minutes
Total flight time = &lt;&lt;41+3.69=44.69&gt;&gt;44.69 minutes

Given:
- The rocket starts with 37 gallons of fuel in its tank.
- The rocket consumes fuel at a rate of 9.5 gallons per minute.

Step 1: Divide the available fuel by the fuel consumption rate.
Time (in minutes) = Available fuel Ã· Fuel consumption rate
Time (in minutes) = 37 gallons Ã· 9.5 gallons/minute
Time (in minutes) = &lt;&lt;37/9.5=3.894736842105263&gt;&gt;3.894736842105263 minutes

Since the rocket cannot fly for a fraction of a minute, we need to round down to the nearest whole minute.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the given information:
   * Flash's maximum speed is 78.64 miles per hour.
   * Flash's current speed is 48.1 miles per hour.

2. To find the increase in speed needed, we need to subtract the current speed from the maximum speed:
   * Speed increase = Maximum speed - Current speed
   * Speed increase = 78.64 - 48.1
   * Speed increase = 30.54 miles per hour

Therefore, Flash should increase his speed by 30.54 miles per hour to reach his maximum speed.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step using the information from the previous question.

Given:
- Flash's current speed is 48.1 miles per hour.
- Flash's maximum speed is 78.64 miles per hour.
- Flash needs to increase his speed by 30.54 miles per hour to reach his maximum speed.
- Every time Flash increases his speed by 1 mile per hour, his power increases by 73.5 units.

Step 1: Calculate the power increase for 1 mile per hour speed increase.
Power increase per 1 mph = 73.5 units

Step 2: Calculate the total speed increase needed to reach the maximum speed.
Total speed increase = 30.54 miles per hour (from the previous question)

Step 3: Calculate the total power increase by multiplying the power increase per 1 mph by the total speed increase.
Total power increase = Power increase per 1 mph Ã— Total speed increase
Total power increase = 73.5 units Ã— 30.54
Total power increase = 2,244.69 units

Therefore, Flash's power will increase by 2,244.69 units when he speeds up from his current speed to his maximum speed.

Given:
- Flash's new maximum speed is 91 miles per hour.
- Flash's current speed is 48.1 miles per hour.

To find the required increase in speed, we need to subtract the current speed from the new maximum speed:

Speed increase = New maximum speed - Current speed
Speed increase = 91 - 48.1
Speed increase = 42.9 miles per hour

Therefore, Flash should increase his speed by 42.9 miles per hour to reach his new maximum speed of 91 miles per hour.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total weight of the two types of beads in the necklace, we need to add the weights of the two types of beads together.

Given:
- The first type of bead weighs 16.2 grams.
- The second type of bead weighs 44.02 grams.

Step 1: Add the weights of the two types of beads.
Total weight = Weight of first type + Weight of second type
Total weight = 16.2 + 44.02
Total weight = &lt;&lt;16.2+44.02=60.22&gt;&gt;60.22 grams

Therefore, the total weight of the two types of beads in the necklace is 60.22 grams.

Given:
- The total weight of the two types of beads is 60.22 grams.

Step 1: Add the weight of the charm to the total weight of the beads.
Total weight of necklace = Total weight of beads + Weight of charm
Total weight of necklace = 60.22 + 43.2
Total weight of necklace = &lt;&lt;60.22+43.2=103.42&gt;&gt;103.42 grams

Therefore, after adding the charm, the total weight of the necklace is 103.42 grams.

1. Understand the given information:

   * After completing half of its orbit, the planet is 25.9 million miles closer to the sun.

2. To find the current distance between the planet and the sun, we need to subtract the distance the planet moved closer from its initial distance.

3. Calculate the current distance:
   * Current distance = Initial distance - Distance moved closer

Given:
- The initial distance between the sun and the planet was 94.88 million miles.
- After completing half of its orbit, the planet is now 32 million miles closer to the sun.

To find the current distance between the planet and the sun, we need to subtract the distance the planet moved closer from its initial distance.

Current distance = Initial distance - Distance moved closer
Current distance = 94.88 million miles - 32 million miles
Current distance = 62.88 million miles

Therefore, with the updated information, the planet would now be 62.88 million miles away from the sun.

Total height = Height of the leading tower + Height of the other child's tower
Total height = 48.9 inches + 78.26 inches
Total height = 127.16 inches

Therefore, the total height of the two towers after the gust of wind is 127.16 inches.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the updated information.

Given:
- The initial height of the leading tower was 52 inches.
- After the gust of wind, the tower lost 3.8 inches in height.

To find the height of the tower after the gust of wind, we need to subtract the height it lost from its initial height:

New height = Initial height - Height lost
New height = 52 inches - 3.8 inches
New height = 48.2 inches

Therefore, after the gust of wind, the leading tower was 48.2 inches tall.

Given:
- Each city initially received 81.1 MWh of energy from the wind farm.
- The cities decided to double their energy received.

Step 1: Multiply the initial energy received by each city by 2 to find the new amount of energy each city would receive.
New energy per city = Initial energy per city Ã— 2
New energy per city = 81.1 MWh Ã— 2

To solve this problem, we will assume that the decimal values represent parts of people, and we will round the numbers to the nearest whole number before adding them together.

Given:
- There are 22.12 people in the living room.
- There are 63.1 people in the dining room.

Step 1: Round the number of people in the living room to the nearest whole number.
People in the living room (rounded) = round(22.12) = 22

Step 2: Round the number of people in the dining room to the nearest whole number.
People in the dining room (rounded) = round(63.1) = 63

Step 3: Add the rounded number of people in the living room and dining room to get the total number of people at the party.
Total people at the party = People in the living room (rounded) + People in the dining room (rounded)
Total people at the party = 22 + 63 = 85

Therefore, after rounding the given numbers to the nearest whole number, there are approximately 85 people at the party in total.

Reasoning:
1. The total distance the snowball traveled is 50.23 meters.
2. The tree is located 24.6 meters away from Jason.
3. To find the distance the snowball traveled past the tree, we need to subtract the distance to the tree from the total distance the snowball traveled.

Calculation:
* Distance past the tree = Total distance - Distance to the tree

To find the total distance the snowball traveled from Jason's hand to its final stopping point, we need to add the distance it traveled in the air and the distance it rolled on the ground.

Reasoning:
1. The snowball traveled 50.23 meters in the air before hitting the ground.
2. After hitting the ground, the snowball rolled an additional 4.4 meters.
3. To find the total distance, we add the distance traveled in the air and the distance rolled on the ground.

* In the second snowball fight, Jason's snowball traveled 78 meters before hitting the ground.
* The tree is still located 24.6 meters away from Jason.

We need to find the distance the snowball traveled past the tree before hitting the ground in this second throw.

Reasoning:
1. The total distance the snowball traveled in the second throw is 78 meters.
2. The tree remains at the same location, 24.6 meters away from Jason.
3. To find the distance the snowball traveled past the tree, we subtract the distance to the tree from the total distance the snowball traveled.

Calculation:
* Distance past the tree = Total distance - Distance to the tree
* Distance past the tree = 78 meters - 24.6 meters
* Distance past the tree = 53.4 meters

Therefore, in the second snowball fight, the snowball traveled 53.4 meters past the tree before hitting the ground.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of beach balls by the number of stores to find out how many beach balls each store receives.

Given:
- The manufacturer produces 3792.28 beach balls.
- The beach balls are distributed equally amongst 45.2 beach stores.

Step 1: Divide the total number of beach balls by the number of stores.
Beach balls per store = Total beach balls Ã· Number of stores
Beach balls per store = 3792.28 Ã· 45.2 â‰ˆ 83.9

Since we cannot distribute a fraction of a beach ball, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Step 2: Round down the result to the nearest whole number.
Beach balls per store (rounded) = 83

Therefore, each beach store receives 83 beach balls.

Given:
- Each store originally received 83 beach balls.
- Each store received an additional shipment equal to the amount they originally received.

Step 1: Calculate the number of beach balls in the additional shipment for each store.
Additional beach balls per store = Original beach balls per store
Additional beach balls per store = 83

Step 2: Calculate the total number of beach balls each store has now by adding the original amount and the additional shipment.
Total beach balls per store = Original beach balls per store + Additional beach balls per store

Given:
- The factory produced 24.91 pencils per minute.

Step 1: Multiply the number of pencils produced per minute by the total number of minutes.

Total pencils produced = 24.91 Ã— 46.98 = &lt;&lt;24.91*46.98=1170.0418&gt;&gt;1,170.0418

Since we cannot have a fraction of a pencil, we need to round the result to the nearest whole number.

Step 2: Round the total pencils produced to the nearest whole number.
Rounded total pencils produced = &lt;&lt;round(1170.0418)=1170&gt;&gt;1,170

Given:

Total cost = Cost of one jacket Ã— Number of jackets
Total cost = $14.97 Ã— 5.9
Total cost = $88.323

However, since we cannot buy a fraction of a jacket, we need to round the number of jackets to the nearest whole number.

Step 2: Round the number of jackets to the nearest whole number.
Rounded number of jackets = 6

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the total weight of the ring from the previous question and then subtract the amount of material removed.

Given:
- The ring initially weighed 126.15 grams (from the previous question).
- The jeweler removes 41.42 grams of material for fine-tuning the design.

Step 1: Subtract the amount of material removed from the initial weight of the ring.
New weight = Initial weight - Amount of material removed
New weight = 126.15 - 41.42
New weight = &lt;&lt;126.15-41.42=84.73&gt;&gt;84.73 grams

Therefore, after removing 41.42 grams of material for fine-tuning the design, the new weight of the ring would be 84.73 grams.

Given:
- The new first metal weighs 26 grams.
- The second metal still weighs 62.95 grams.

Step 1: Add the weights of the two metals in the modified design.
New total weight = New weight of first metal + Weight of second metal
New total weight = 26 + 62.95
New total weight = &lt;&lt;26+62.95=88.95&gt;&gt;88.95 grams

* The pizza place sold 84.3 pepperoni pizzas today.
* They sold 47.9 more mushroom pizzas than pepperoni pizzas.

To find the total number of pizzas sold, we need to:
1. Find the number of mushroom pizzas sold.
2. Add the number of pepperoni pizzas and mushroom pizzas.

Step 1: Find the number of mushroom pizzas sold
* Mushroom pizzas sold = Pepperoni pizzas sold + 47.9
* Mushroom pizzas sold = 84.3 + 47.9 = 132.2

Step 2: Add the number of pepperoni pizzas and mushroom pizzas
* Total pizzas sold = Pepperoni pizzas + Mushroom pizzas
* Total pizzas sold = 84.3 + 132.2 = 216.5

Therefore, the pizza place sold a total of 216.5 pizzas today.

* The castle's actual height is 68.4 meters.
* In the scale model, 1 meter of the original castle corresponds to 27.69 millimeters.

Now, let's calculate the height of the model castle:
1. Since 1 meter of the original castle is represented by 27.69 mm in the model, we need to multiply the actual height of the castle by 27.69 to get the height of the model in millimeters.

   Model height = Actual height Ã— Scale factor
                = 68.4 Ã— 27.69
                = &lt;&lt;68.4*27.69=1893.996&gt;&gt;1893.996 mm

2. Rounding the result to the nearest millimeter:
   Model height â‰ˆ &lt;&lt;round(1893.996)=1894&gt;&gt;1894 mm

Therefore, the scale model of the castle will be approximately 1894 millimeters tall.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We need to add the amount of regular vegetation the dinosaur consumed to the amount of new vegetation it tried.

Given:
- The dinosaur consumed 947.40 kilograms of its regular vegetation (from the previous problem).
- It also consumed 97.01 kilograms of a new type of plant.

Step 1: Add the amount of regular vegetation consumed to the amount of new vegetation consumed.
Total vegetation consumed = Regular vegetation + New vegetation
Total vegetation consumed = 947.40 kilograms + 97.01 kilograms
Total vegetation consumed = 1044.41 kilograms

Step 2: Round the answer to two decimal places (as the given values have two decimal places).
Total vegetation consumed â‰ˆ 1044.41 kilograms

- The total weight of the gold and gems is 93.9 kilograms (from the previous question).
- After adding silver, the total hoard weight is decreased by 6.74 kilograms.

To find the new total weight of the dragon's hoard, we need to subtract the decrease in weight from the initial total weight.

Step 1: Calculate the new total weight of the dragon's hoard.
New total weight = Initial total weight - Decrease in weight
New total weight = 93.9 kg - 6.74 kg
New total weight = 87.16 kg

Therefore, after adding silver and decreasing the total weight by 6.74 kilograms, the new total weight of the dragon's hoard will be 87.16 kilograms.

            Following on from the previous problem, suppose the number of giraffes in the herd were halved to 19 instead of 38.9. Assuming the same total amount of leaf consumption as before (2571.29 kilograms), how many kilograms of leaves would each giraffe in this smaller herd consume daily?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the information from the previous problem.

Given:
- The herd still eats 2571.29 kilograms of leaves each day.
- The number of giraffes in the herd is now 19 (half of the original 38.9).

Step 1: Divide the total amount of leaves eaten by the herd each day by the new number of giraffes in the herd.
Kilograms of leaves per giraffe = 2571.29 Ã· 19
Kilograms of leaves per giraffe = 135.33 (rounded to the nearest hundredth)

In this scenario, with the herd size reduced to 19 giraffes, each giraffe would consume approximately 135.33 kilograms of leaves daily, assuming the total leaf consumption remains the same.

            A unicorn needs 217.35 units of magic energy to teleport to another location. If one rainbow provides 20.7 units of magic energy, how many rainbows will it consume for the unicorn to teleport once?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many rainbows are needed to provide the required magic energy for the unicorn to teleport once.

Given:
- The unicorn needs 217.35 units of magic energy to teleport.
- One rainbow provides 20.7 units of magic energy.

To find the number of rainbows needed, we divide the total magic energy required by the magic energy provided by one rainbow.

Number of rainbows = Total magic energy required Ã· Magic energy provided by one rainbow
Number of rainbows = 217.35 Ã· 20.7
Number of rainbows â‰ˆ 10.5 (rounded to the nearest tenth)

However, since we can't have a fraction of a rainbow, we need to round up to the next whole number to ensure the unicorn has enough magic energy to teleport.
