        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the average number of miles the bus drives each week, we need to divide the total number of miles driven by the number of weeks.

Given:
- The bus drives a total of 2496 miles over 52 weeks.

Step 1: Divide the total miles by the number of weeks.
Average miles per week = Total miles Ã· Number of weeks
Average miles per week = 2496 Ã· 52
Average miles per week = 48

Therefore, the bus drives an average of 48 miles each week.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same approach as before.

Given:
- The bus drives a total of 6100 miles over 52 weeks.

Step 1: Divide the total miles by the number of weeks.
Average miles per week = Total miles Ã· Number of weeks
Average miles per week = 6100 Ã· 52
Average miles per week = 117.3076923076923

Since we can't have a fraction of a mile, we'll round the answer to the nearest whole number.

Step 2: Round the result to the nearest whole number.
Average miles per week â‰ˆ 117 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Therefore, if the school bus had driven 6100 miles over the same 52 weeks, it would have driven an average of approximately 117 miles each week.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The astronaut's mission lasts for 90 days.
   * He consumes a total of 3870 liters of oxygen during the mission.
   * His oxygen consumption is the same every day.

2. To find the daily oxygen consumption, we need to divide the total oxygen consumed by the number of days:
   * Daily oxygen consumption = Total oxygen consumed Ã· Number of days
   * Daily oxygen consumption = 3870 liters Ã· 90 days
   * Daily oxygen consumption = 43 liters per day

Therefore, the astronaut uses 43 liters of oxygen daily.

Given:
- The astronaut's mission is now extended to 124 days.
- He still uses a total of 3870 liters of oxygen during the mission.

To find the daily oxygen consumption with the extended mission duration, we need to divide the total oxygen consumed by the new number of days:

Daily oxygen consumption = Total oxygen consumed Ã· Number of days
Daily oxygen consumption = 3870 liters Ã· 124 days
Daily oxygen consumption = 31.2096... liters per day

We can round this value to the nearest tenth of a liter for a more practical answer:

Daily oxygen consumption â‰ˆ 31.2 liters per day

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same approach as before.

Given:
- The manufacturer now produces 2301 pounds of dog food in a day.
- The dog food is still evenly distributed into 50 bags.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of food in each bag by dividing the total amount of dog food by the number of bags.
Pounds of food per bag = Total pounds of food Ã· Number of bags
Pounds of food per bag = 2301 Ã· 50
Pounds of food per bag = &lt;&lt;2301/50=46.02&gt;&gt;46.02

However, since we can't have a fraction of a pound in a bag, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Step 2: Round down the result to the nearest whole number.
Pounds of food per bag (rounded) = &lt;&lt;floor(46.02)=46&gt;&gt;46

Therefore, with the new production procedure, each bag will contain 46 pounds of dog food.

- They still want to pack the grapes evenly among 62 boxes.

Step 1: Divide the total number of grapes by the number of boxes.

This means that if we distribute the grapes evenly, each box will contain 77 grapes, and there will be 56 grapes left over.

Step 2: Distribute the remaining grapes.

* The city is monitored by 30 police officers.

We need to find out how many blocks each officer is responsible for in this larger city.

Reasoning:
1. Similar to the previous problem, if the city is divided evenly among the officers, we can find the number of blocks per officer by dividing the total number of blocks by the number of officers.
2. Number of blocks per officer = Total number of blocks Ã· Number of officers
3. Number of blocks per officer = 3698 Ã· 30 = 123 remainder 8
4. Since we can't divide the blocks into fractional parts, each officer will be responsible for at least 123 blocks.
5. The remaining 8 blocks (3698 - (123 Ã— 30) = 8) will be distributed among 8 officers, so each of these officers will be responsible for 124 blocks.

Therefore, in the larger city, 22 officers will be responsible for 123 blocks each, and 8 officers will be responsible for 124 blocks each.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information and find the solution step by step:

* The river flows for a total of 902 kilometers.
* The river passes through 82 cities.
* The river's length is evenly distributed among these cities.

To find the number of kilometers of the river's length within each city, we need to divide the total length of the river by the number of cities it passes through.

Calculation:
* River length per city = Total river length Ã· Number of cities
* River length per city = 902 km Ã· 82
* River length per city = 11 km

Therefore, if the river's length is evenly distributed among the cities, each city has 11 kilometers of the river's length within it.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same approach as before, but with the new information.

Given:
* The river now flows for a total of 3767 kilometers.
* The river still passes through 82 cities.
* The river's length is evenly distributed among these cities.

To find the number of kilometers of the river's length within each city under this new scenario, we need to divide the new total length of the river by the number of cities it passes through.

Calculation:
* River length per city = Total river length Ã· Number of cities
* River length per city = 3767 km Ã· 82
* River length per city = 45.93902439... km

Since we can't have a fractional part of a kilometer, we round the result to the nearest whole number.

* River length per city â‰ˆ 46 km

Therefore, if the river's length is evenly distributed among the cities in this new scenario, each city would have approximately 46 kilometers of the river's length within it.

Given:
- There are now 9083 seashells in total.
- The seashells are scattered across the same 41-meter stretch of sand.

Step 1: Divide the total number of seashells by the length of the stretch of sand.
Seashells per meter = Total number of seashells Ã· Length of the stretch of sand
Seashells per meter = 9083 Ã· 41 = 221.5365853658536

Since we can't have a fraction of a seashell, we need to round the result to the nearest whole number.

Step 2: Round the result to the nearest whole number.
Rounded seashells per meter = 222

Therefore, if 9083 seashells are evenly distributed across the 41-meter stretch of beach sand, there will be approximately 222 seashells per meter.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great question! Let's solve this problem using the same approach as before.

Given:
- Total number of items: 2347
- Number of sets: 6

Step 1: Divide the total number of items by the number of sets.
2347 Ã· 6 = 391 remainder 1

In this case, we have a remainder of 1, which means that we cannot evenly distribute all the items into 6 sets. However, we can still determine how many items will be in each set.

Step 2: Distribute the remaining item.
Since we have 1 item remaining, we can add it to one of the sets. This means that 5 sets will have 391 items each, and 1 set will have 392 items.

Therefore, if 2347 items are divided into 6 sets, 5 sets will have 391 items each, and 1 set will have 392 items.

Given:
- The improved bubble machine produces a total of 6080 bubbles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The company wants to fill 1320 bottles in total.
* The filling process should be evenly spread over 88 hours.

To find the number of bottles filled per hour, we need to divide the total number of bottles by the number of hours.

Bottles per hour = Total bottles Ã· Total hours
Bottles per hour = 1320 Ã· 88
Bottles per hour = 15

Therefore, the company should fill 15 bottles per hour to meet their target of 1320 bottles evenly spread over 88 hours.

Given:
* The new target is to fill 8607 bottles.
* The filling process should be completed within the same 88 hours.

To find the number of bottles filled per hour under the new target, we divide the total number of bottles by the number of hours.

Bottles per hour = Total bottles Ã· Total hours
Bottles per hour = 8607 Ã· 88
Bottles per hour = 97.8 (rounded to the nearest tenth)

Since we can't fill a fraction of a bottle, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the company should fill 98 bottles per hour to meet their new target of 8607 bottles within the 88 hours of operation.

* Annapurna has 3520 tulips to plant.
* She has 3052 spaces to plant them.
* She wants to split the tulips evenly among the spaces.

To find the number of tulips in each space, we need to divide the total number of tulips by the number of spaces:

Number of tulips per space = Total number of tulips Ã· Number of spaces
* Number of tulips per space = 3520 Ã· 3052

However, 3520 is not divisible by 3052 without a remainder. In this case, we need to round up to ensure that each space has at least the calculated number of tulips.

* 3520 Ã· 3052 â‰ˆ 1.1534 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

- The output is evenly distributed across the 52 weeks.

To find the number of tomatoes produced each week in the new season, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes by the number of weeks in the season.

Tomatoes per week = Total tomatoes Ã· Number of weeks
Tomatoes per week = 2502 Ã· 52

To perform the division, let's use long division:

  48
52âŸŒ2502
  2080
  â”€â”€â”€â”€
   422
   416
   â”€â”€â”€
     6

So, 2502 Ã· 52 = 48 with a remainder of 6.

In this case, since we are dealing with whole tomatoes, we can say that the garden produces 48 tomatoes per week, with 6 tomatoes left over at the end of the season.

* Each bracelet should have an equal number of beads.

To find the number of beads in each bracelet, we need to divide the total number of beads by the number of bracelets:

Number of beads per bracelet = Total number of beads Ã· Number of bracelets
Number of beads per bracelet = 1944 Ã· 72

Let's perform the division:
1944 Ã· 72 = 27

Therefore, each bracelet will have 27 beads.

Given:
* The jeweler has a total of 1944 beads.
* The jeweler now wants to make 495 bracelets.
* Each bracelet should have an equal number of beads.

To find the number of beads in each bracelet, we divide the total number of beads by the number of bracelets:

Number of beads per bracelet = Total number of beads Ã· Number of bracelets
Number of beads per bracelet = 1944 Ã· 495

Let's perform the division:
1944 Ã· 495 = 3.928

However, we cannot have a fraction of a bead in a bracelet. In this case, the jeweler will have to use the maximum number of whole beads per bracelet, which is 3.

Therefore, each bracelet will have 3 beads.

   * Each plant yielded the same number of cucumbers as in the previous season.

2. Recall the number of cucumbers from each plant in the previous season:
   * From the previous problem, we know that the farmer got 18 cucumbers from each plant.

3. Calculate the total number of cucumbers harvested if each plant yielded 18 cucumbers:
   * Total number of cucumbers = Number of cucumbers from each plant Ã— Number of plants
   * Total number of cucumbers = 18 Ã— 52
   * Total number of cucumbers = 936

4. Compare the actual harvest (8539 cucumbers) with the calculated harvest (936 cucumbers):
   * The actual harvest is much larger than the calculated harvest, which means the farmer did not get the same number of cucumbers from each plant as in the previous season.

5. Calculate the number of cucumbers from each plant in the current season:
   * Number of cucumbers from each plant = Total number of cucumbers Ã· Number of plants
   * Number of cucumbers from each plant = 8539 Ã· 52
   * Number of cucumbers from each plant = 164.21 (rounded to the nearest whole number, 164)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this new situation, the manufacturer makes a larger batch of 1192 milliliters of juice, and the juice will still be distributed equally into 13 bottles.

Given:
- The manufacturer makes a large batch of 1192 milliliters of juice.
- The juice will be distributed equally into 13 bottles.

Step 1: Divide the total amount of juice by the number of bottles.
Juice per bottle = Total amount of juice Ã· Number of bottles
Juice per bottle = 1192 Ã· 13 = 91.69230769230769 milliliters

Since we can't have a fraction of a milliliter in a bottle, we need to round the result to the nearest whole number.

Step 2: Round the result to the nearest whole number.
Rounded juice per bottle = 92 milliliters

Therefore, with the larger batch of 1192 milliliters of juice, each bottle will contain 92 milliliters of juice.

Given:
- The scooter now travels a total of 3984 feet.

To calculate the number of feet the scooter travels in each second, we divide the new total distance by the total time:

Feet per second = New total distance Ã· Total time
Feet per second = 3984 feet Ã· 64 seconds
Feet per second = 62.25 feet per second

Since we can't have a fraction of a foot in this context, we round the answer to the nearest whole number:

Step 1: Divide the total number of lamps by the number of stores.

This means that if we distribute the lamps equally, each store will receive 93 lamps, and there will be 10 lamps left over.

Step 2: Distribute the remaining lamps.
Since there are 10 lamps left over, we can give one extra lamp to 10 of the 51 stores.

Therefore, 41 stores will receive 93 lamps each, and 10 stores will receive 94 lamps each.

* The pirate ship has a total of 6097 gold coins.
* The coins are evenly distributed among 91 chests.

To find the number of coins in each chest, we need to divide the total number of coins by the number of chests.

6097 Ã· 91 = 67

Therefore, each chest contains 67 gold coins.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Alright, let's solve this problem with the updated information:
* The pirate ship has a total of 6097 gold coins.
* The coins are now evenly distributed among 2910 chests.

To find the number of coins in each chest, we divide the total number of coins by the number of chests.

6097 Ã· 2910 = 2.095...

However, we can't have a fractional number of coins in each chest. In this case, the coins will be distributed as evenly as possible, with some chests containing one more coin than others.

To determine the minimum number of coins in each chest, we use integer division:
6097 // 2910 = 2

This means that each chest will have at least 2 coins.

Now, let's calculate the remaining coins:
6097 - (2910 Ã— 2) = 277

So, 277 chests will have one extra coin, making it 3 coins in those chests.

Therefore, 2910 - 277 = 2633 chests will have 2 coins each, and 277 chests will have 3 coins each.

Given:
- The treasure chest now contains 5005 gold coins.
- The coins are to be divided evenly among the same 97 pirates.

Step 1: Divide the total number of gold coins by the number of pirates.
5005 Ã· 97 = 51 remainder 58

This means that if we divide 5005 coins evenly among 97 pirates, each pirate will receive 51 coins, and there will be 58 coins left over.

Step 2: Distribute the remaining coins.
Since there are 58 coins left over, we can give one extra coin to each of the first 58 pirates.

Therefore, in this case:
- 58 pirates will receive 52 coins each (51 + 1 extra coin)
- 39 pirates will receive 51 coins each

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous year, the hat maker produced 19 hats per week over 57 weeks, making a total of 1083 hats.

In the following year, the hat maker produces a total of 7678 hats over the same number of weeks (57).

To find the number of hats the hat maker now produces weekly, we need to divide the total number of hats made in the following year by the number of weeks.

Given:
- The hat maker makes 7678 hats in total in the following year.
- The hat maker works for 57 weeks.

Calculation:
Number of hats made per week = Total number of hats Ã· Number of weeks
Number of hats made per week = 7678 Ã· 57 = 134.7 (rounded to the nearest tenth)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a hat, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, in the following year, the hat maker produces 134 hats every week.

* The sock manufacturer produced a total of 4218 pairs of socks.
* They produced these socks over a period of 74 days.

Given:

- The coins are still spread evenly among 66 small chests.

Step 1: Divide the new total number of gold coins by the number of chests.

This means that if the dragon spreads the coins evenly among the 66 chests, there will be 52 coins in each chest, with 21 coins left over.

Step 2: Distribute the remaining 21 coins.
The dragon can put one extra coin in 21 of the chests, so 21 chests will have 53 coins each, while the remaining 45 chests will have 52 coins each.

This means that there are 30 complete starfish, and there are 8 limbs left over. However, since a starfish cannot have only 8 limbs (each starfish has 9 limbs), these 8 limbs must belong to another starfish.

Therefore, the total number of starfish is 30 + 1 = 31.

* The city park covers an area of 1927 acres.
* The park is divided into 47 equal sections.
* We need to find the size of each section in acres.

To find the size of each section, we need to divide the total area of the park by the number of sections:

* Size of each section = Total area of the park Ã· Number of sections
* Size of each section = 1927 acres Ã· 47
* Size of each section = 41 acres

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The forest has a total of 2508 animals.
   * The animals are evenly dispersed throughout a 1417-hectare terrain.

2. To find the number of animals per hectare, we need to divide the total number of animals by the total number of hectares:
   * Animals per hectare = Total animals Ã· Total hectares
   * Animals per hectare = 2508 Ã· 1417

3. Perform the division:
   * 2508 Ã· 1417 â‰ˆ 1.77 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, you would expect to encounter approximately 1.77 animals in each hectare of the forest.

* The total distance of the thru-hike is 4526 miles.
* The backpacker plans to walk for 62 days.
* The backpacker intends to walk the same distance each day.

To find the distance the backpacker walks each day, we need to divide the total distance by the number of days:

Daily distance = Total distance Ã· Number of days
Daily distance = 4526 miles Ã· 62 days
Daily distance = 72.96774193548387 miles/day

Since the question asks for the distance in miles, we should round the answer to a reasonable number of decimal places. Rounding to two decimal places:

Daily distance â‰ˆ 72.97 miles/day

Reasoning:
1. The total duration of the signal is now 9094 seconds.
2. The signal is still divided into 37 equal pulses.
3. To find the duration of each pulse, we need to divide the new total duration by the number of pulses.

Total jewels = 6402
Number of years = 43

Jewels collected each year = Total jewels Ã· Number of years

To calculate the amount of water the tank provides per day with the new volume, we'll use the same formula as before:

Given:
- The toy company has 4686 stuffed animals.
- The stuffed animals need to be evenly distributed among 1023 stores.

Step 1: Divide the total number of stuffed animals by the number of stores.
Number of stuffed animals per store = Total number of stuffed animals Ã· Number of stores
Number of stuffed animals per store = 4686 Ã· 1023 = &lt;&lt;4686/1023=4.58&gt;&gt;4.58 (rounded to two decimal places)

However, since we cannot distribute a fraction of a stuffed animal, each store will receive the integer part of the result, which is 4 stuffed animals.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining stuffed animals.
Remaining stuffed animals = Total number of stuffed animals - (Number of stores Ã— Stuffed animals per store)
Remaining stuffed animals = 4686 - (1023 Ã— 4) = &lt;&lt;4686-(1023*4)=594&gt;&gt;594

The remaining 594 stuffed animals can be distributed among the first 594 stores, giving them one extra stuffed animal each.

Therefore, in this new scenario, 594 stores will receive 5 stuffed animals each, and the remaining 429 stores will receive 4 stuffed animals each.

Number of boxes = 910 Ã· 10
Number of boxes = 91

Therefore, the company will need 91 boxes to pack all the toy cars.

- The company has 910 toy cars.
- They now want to pack the cars in boxes that can hold 538 cars each.

To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of cars by the number of cars per box.

Number of boxes = Total number of cars Ã· Cars per box
Number of boxes = 910 Ã· 538

910 Ã· 538 = 1.69144981412639

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up to 2 boxes.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The juice factory produces 1333 bottles of juice.
   * The bottles are packed evenly into 43 boxes.

2. To find the number of bottles in each box, we need to divide the total number of bottles by the number of boxes:
   * Number of bottles per box = Total number of bottles Ã· Number of boxes
   * Number of bottles per box = 1333 Ã· 43

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same steps as before, but with the new information.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The juice factory now produces 423 bottles of juice (instead of 1333).
   * The bottles are still packed evenly into 43 boxes.

2. To find the number of bottles in each box, we need to divide the total number of bottles by the number of boxes:
   * Number of bottles per box = Total number of bottles Ã· Number of boxes
   * Number of bottles per box = 423 Ã· 43

3. Perform the division:
   * 423 Ã· 43 = 9 remainder 36
   * This means that each box will have 9 bottles, and there will be 36 bottles left over.

4. Since the bottles must be distributed evenly, the remaining 36 bottles cannot be packed into the boxes.

Therefore, with the reduced production of 423 bottles, each box will contain 9 bottles of juice, and 36 bottles will be left over.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the information given in the previous problem and add the new information.

Given:
- Initially, the benefactor donated 741 gifts, which were evenly divided among 13 shelters.
- Now, the benefactor increased the total number of gifts to 3697.
- The additional gifts were also evenly divided among the same 13 shelters.

Step 1: Calculate the number of additional gifts.
Additional gifts = New total gifts - Initial total gifts
Additional gifts = 3697 - 741 = 2956

Step 2: Divide the additional gifts evenly among the 13 shelters.
Additional gifts per shelter = Additional gifts Ã· Number of shelters
Additional gifts per shelter = 2956 Ã· 13 = 227 remainder 5

Step 3: Add the initial gifts per shelter to the additional gifts per shelter.
Total gifts per shelter = Initial gifts per shelter + Additional gifts per shelter
Total gifts per shelter = 57 + 227 = 284

Note: The remainder of 5 gifts can be distributed among the shelters as needed, but for the purpose of this problem, we'll assume an even distribution.

Given:
- The new giant snowball has a volume of 3327 cubic feet.
- The child makes 16 smaller snowballs using the same amount of snow.

To find the volume of each smaller snowball, we divide the total volume of the giant snowball by the number of smaller snowballs:

Volume of each smaller snowball = Total volume Ã· Number of smaller snowballs
Volume of each smaller snowball = 3327 Ã· 16
Volume of each smaller snowball = &lt;&lt;3327/16=207.9375&gt;&gt;207.9375 cubic feet

Since we can't have a fractional part of a cubic foot in this context, we round the result to the nearest whole number:

Volume of each smaller snowball â‰ˆ &lt;&lt;round(207.9375)=208&gt;&gt;208 cubic feet

Therefore, if the child uses 3327 cubic feet of snow to make a giant snowball and divides it into 16 smaller snowballs, each smaller snowball would have a volume of approximately 208 cubic feet.
