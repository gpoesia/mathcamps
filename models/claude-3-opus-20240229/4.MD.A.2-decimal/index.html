        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. First, let's find the distance Maria covered in the first stretch of her journey.
   - She drove at an average speed of 11.0 miles per hour for 6.7 hours.
   - Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   - Distance = 11.0 miles/hour Ã— 6.7 hours = 73.7 miles

2. After completing the first stretch, Maria immediately continued for another 4.3 miles.

3. To find the total distance, we add the distances from both stretches.
   - Total distance = Distance from first stretch + Distance from second stretch
   - Total distance = 73.7 miles + 4.3 miles
   - Total distance = 78 miles

Given:
- Maria drove at an average speed of 11.0 miles per hour for 19 hours before stopping for a break.
- After the break, she immediately continued for another 4.3 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Maria covered in the first stretch of her journey.
Distance = Speed Ã— Time
Distance = 11.0 miles/hour Ã— 19 hours = 209 miles

Step 2: Add the distance from the second stretch to the distance from the first stretch.
Total distance = Distance from first stretch + Distance from second stretch
Total distance = 209 miles + 4.3 miles
Total distance = 213.3 miles

1. Understand the given information:
   * The original garden is 3 meters wide.
   * Eva extends the garden by 22.6 meters.
   * After the extension, the garden's length is equal to the width of the original garden times the total length after the extension.

2. Calculate the total length of the garden after the extension:
   * Total length = Original width + Extension length
   * Total length = 3 meters + 22.6 meters
   * Total length = 25.6 meters

* The race lasts for 19 days.
* Each day, the cyclist has to ride 8.9 miles.
* The cyclist received a bonus of 38 miles from the previous race.

To find the total miles the cyclist has to ride for this race, we need to:
1. Calculate the total miles for the 19 days of the race.
2. Add the bonus miles to the total miles from the race.

Step 1: Calculate the total miles for the 19 days of the race
* Total miles = Number of days Ã— Miles per day
* Total miles = 19 Ã— 8.9 = 169.1 miles

Step 2: Add the bonus miles to the total miles from the race
* Total miles for the race = Total miles from Step 1 + Bonus miles

* Bob travels 6.1 miles to the grocery store.
* His total trip (going and coming back) is the summation of his distance to the grocery and back home.
* He makes this trip 3 times a week.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total distance of one round trip to the grocery store and back:
   * One round trip = Distance to the grocery store + Distance back home
   * One round trip = 6.1 miles + 6.1 miles
   * One round trip = 12.2 miles

2. Calculate the total distance traveled in a week:
   * Weekly distance = One round trip Ã— Number of trips per week
   * Weekly distance = 12.2 miles Ã— 3
   * Weekly distance = 36.6 miles

Therefore, Bob travels a total of 36.6 miles per week for his grocery trips.

Given:

* Bob visits her and returns home three times a week.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance of one round trip to his grandmother's house.
* One round trip = Distance to grandmother's house + Distance back home
* One round trip = 36 miles + 36 miles
* One round trip = 72 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled in a week for visiting his grandmother.
* Weekly distance for grandmother visits = One round trip Ã— Number of trips per week
* Weekly distance for grandmother visits = 72 miles Ã— 3
* Weekly distance for grandmother visits = 216 miles

Therefore, Bob would be driving a total of 216 miles per week just for visiting his grandmother.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Maria had:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Alright, let's solve this new scenario using the same problem-solving approach. In this case, your hourly rate has changed to $4 per hour.

Given:
- Your new hourly rate is $4 per hour.
- You will work for 1 hour.

Step 1: Calculate your earnings by multiplying your hourly rate by the number of hours worked.
Earnings = Hourly rate Ã— Hours worked
Earnings = $4 Ã— 1 = $4

Therefore, if you work for 1 hour at your new job with an hourly rate of $4, you will earn $4.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many miles the vehicle travels per gallon of gas, we need to divide the total miles traveled by the number of gallons in a full tank.

Given:
- The vehicle travels 367.8 miles on a full tank of gas.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll first find out how much money John had left after spending $8 at the store, and then we'll add the birthday money he received from his grandmother.

Given:
- John had $37.3 in his savings account initially.
- He spent $8 at the store.
- His grandmother gave him $12.0 for his birthday.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining amount in John's savings account after spending $8.
Remaining amount after spending = Initial amount - Amount spent
Remaining amount after spending = $37.3 - $8 = $29.3

Step 2: Add the birthday money John received from his grandmother to his remaining savings.
Total amount in savings account = Remaining amount after spending + Birthday money
Total amount in savings account = $29.3 + $12.0 = $41.3

Therefore, after spending $8 at the store and receiving $12.0 from his grandmother for his birthday, John now has $41.3 in his savings account.

Given:
- John has $40 in his savings account.

Step 1: Divide the total amount by the number of weeks.
Amount to save each week = Total amount Ã· Number of weeks

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the information from the previous question.

Given:
- Initially, Samuel had 176 liters of paint, which he distributed evenly into 8 barrels.
- Each barrel contained 22 liters of paint.
- Now, Samuel wants to fill 43 barrels with the same quantity of paint (22 liters) as before.

To find the total liters of paint needed, we multiply the number of barrels by the liters of paint per barrel:

Total liters of paint needed = Number of barrels Ã— Liters of paint per barrel
Total liters of paint needed = 43 Ã— 22
Total liters of paint needed = 946

Therefore, Samuel will need 946 liters of paint in total to fill 43 barrels with 22 liters each.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Samuel has a total of 176 liters of paint.
   * He wants to distribute the paint evenly into 29 barrels.

2. To find the number of liters in each barrel, we need to divide the total amount of paint by the number of barrels:
   * Liters of paint per barrel = Total liters of paint Ã· Number of barrels
   * Liters of paint per barrel = 176 Ã· 29

3. Perform the division:
   * 176 Ã· 29 â‰ˆ 6.069 (rounded to three decimal places)

Since we can't have a fraction of a liter in a barrel, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means that each barrel will contain 6 liters of paint.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of money Alex had initially:
   * Alex had $35.79 saved in his piggy bank.

2. Identify the amount of money Alex received from his grandma:
   * Alex's grandma gave him $8 for his birthday.

3. Add the initial amount and the birthday money to find the total amount Alex has now:
   * Total amount = Initial savings + Birthday money
   * Total amount = $35.79 + $8
   * Total amount = $43.79

Therefore, after receiving his birthday money, Alex now has $43.79.

* John currently has $37 in his bank account.
* His mother gives him an additional $8.

To find out how much money John has now, we need to add the money he already had in his account to the money his mother gave him.

$37 (current amount) + $8 (additional amount) = $45

Therefore, after receiving the additional $8 from his mother, John now has $45 in his bank account.

* John had $45 in his bank account after receiving money from his mother.
* He used $4 to pay for a bus ticket.

To find out how much money John has left, we need to subtract the amount he spent on the bus ticket from his total money.

$45 (total money) - $4 (bus ticket) = $41

So, after paying for the bus ticket, John now has $41 left in his bank account.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's use the following steps:

1. Find the rate of gas consumption per hour:
   * The car consumes 615 liters of gas in 41 hours.
   * Rate of gas consumption = 615 liters Ã· 41 hours = 15 liters/hour

2. Calculate the gas consumed in 30 hours:
   * Gas consumed = Rate of gas consumption Ã— Number of hours
   * Gas consumed = 15 liters/hour Ã— 30 hours = 450 liters

Therefore, the car will consume 450 liters of gas in 30 hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step using the information from the previous problem.

Given:
- The car consumes 615 liters of gas every 41 hours.
- The car has consumed gas for 30 hours.
- Due to a leak, the car lost 46.33 liters of the gas consumed.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of gas consumed in 30 hours (from the previous problem).
Gas consumed in 30 hours = 15 liters/hour Ã— 30 hours = 450 liters

Step 2: Subtract the amount of gas lost due to the leak from the total gas consumed.
Remaining gas = Gas consumed in 30 hours - Gas lost due to the leak
Remaining gas = 450 liters - 46.33 liters = 403.67 liters

Therefore, 403.67 liters of gas remain in the car after the leak.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the new fuel consumption rate.

Given:
- The car now consumes 615 liters of gas every 23 hours.
- We need to find the gas consumption in 30 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the new rate of gas consumption per hour.
Rate of gas consumption = Total gas consumed Ã· Number of hours
Rate of gas consumption = 615 liters Ã· 23 hours â‰ˆ 26.74 liters/hour

Step 2: Calculate the gas consumed in 30 hours at the new rate.
Gas consumed = Rate of gas consumption Ã— Number of hours
Gas consumed = 26.74 liters/hour Ã— 30 hours â‰ˆ 802.17 liters

To round the answer to the nearest whole number, we get 802 liters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step with the new information:

1. Find the monthly installment for the car:
   * Total cost of the car = $41
   * Number of monthly installments = 19.51
   * Monthly installment = Total cost Ã· Number of installments
   * Monthly installment = $41 Ã· 19.51 = $2.10 (rounded to the nearest cent)

2. Add the car insurance to the monthly installment:
   * Monthly car insurance = $41.35
   * Total monthly payment = Monthly installment + Monthly car insurance
   * Total monthly payment = $2.10 + $41.35 = $43.45

Given:
- Lisa originally had 30.3 acres of farmland.
- She recently bought another plot of 5.9 acres.
- Mona has the same amount of land as Lisa.

Step 1: Calculate the total acreage of Lisa's farmland.
Lisa's total acreage = Original farmland + Newly bought plot
Lisa's total acreage = 30.3 acres + 5.9 acres
Lisa's total acreage = 36.2 acres

Step 2: Calculate the total acreage of Mona's farmland.
Mona's total acreage = Lisa's total acreage (since they have the same amount of land)
Mona's total acreage = 36.2 acres

Step 3: Calculate the combined total acreage of Lisa and Mona's farmland.
Combined total acreage = Lisa's total acreage + Mona's total acreage
Combined total acreage = 36.2 acres + 36.2 acres

Given:
- You started with $46 instead of $38.
- You bought the same toy for $3.
- You were given the same amount of $40 after buying the toy.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money you had after buying the toy.
Money after buying the toy = Initial money - Cost of the toy
Money after buying the toy = $46 - $3 = $43

Step 2: Calculate the total money you have now by adding the money you had after buying the toy and the money you were given.
Total money now = Money after buying the toy + Money given
Total money now = $43 + $40 = $83

Therefore, you now have a total of $83.

Given:
- Sally ran 38.5 miles in the first week.
- Instead of increasing her distance by 2 miles, she decided to increase it by 41 miles in the second week.

To find the number of miles Sally would have run in the second week, we need to add the increase in mileage to her initial mileage.

Calculation:
Miles in the second week = Miles in the first week + Increase in mileage
Miles in the second week = 38.5 miles + 41 miles

   * Amount in wallet after adding $5 = $4 + $5 = $9

3. He discovers a forgotten envelope with $27.97 and adds it to his wallet.
   * Amount in wallet after adding $27.97 = $9 + $27.97 = $36.97

4. At the collector's flea market, he buys 17 vintage comic books, each costing the new total amount he currently has in his wallet.
   * Cost of each comic book = $36.97
   * Total cost of 17 comic books = $36.97 Ã— 17 = $628.49

Therefore, with the new initial amount in his wallet, John spends a total of $628.49 on the 17 vintage comic books.

* John has $45.3 (from the previous question)
* Jacob also had $6.3 in his piggy bank and found a $39 bill on the street

First, let's calculate how much money Jacob has:
* Jacob's money = $6.3 + $39 = $45.3

Now, to find out how much money they have together, we need to add John's money and Jacob's money:
* Total money = John's money + Jacob's money
* Total money = $45.3 + $45.3
* Total money = $90.6

Therefore, John and Jacob have a total of $90.6 when they combine their money.

Given:
- Roger spent $18.50 on lunch.

To calculate the cost of lunch in the new currency, we need to multiply the amount spent in dollars by the exchange rate.

Cost of lunch in new currency = Amount spent in dollars Ã— Exchange rate
Cost of lunch in new currency = $18.50 Ã— $2.47 per dollar

Step 1: Add the cost of the VIP experience to the original cost of each movie ticket.

Cost per ticket = Total amount paid Ã· Number of tickets
Cost per ticket = $721.11 Ã· 6
Cost per ticket = $120.185

Since we are dealing with money, we round the result to the nearest cent.

   * Total cost of fruits = 34.2 Ã— $11.01 = $376.542

2. Add the cost of the snacks:
   * The customer spent an extra $7 on snacks.
   * Total money spent = Cost of fruits + Cost of snacks
   * Total money spent = $376.542 + $7 = $383.542

* The total distance the cyclist pedaled is 50.0 kilometers.
* The cyclist covered 38.4 kilometers before taking a break.

To find out how far the cyclist pedaled after resuming from the break, we need to subtract the distance covered before the break from the total distance.

Distance after break = Total distance - Distance before break
Distance after break = 50.0 km - 38.4 km
Distance after break = 11.6 km

Given:
* The cyclist pedaled 11.6 kilometers after resuming from the break on a single day.
* The cyclist repeats the same cycle for 7 days.

To find the total distance the cyclist covers after resuming from the break over 7 days, we need to multiply the distance covered after the break on a single day by the number of days.

Total distance after break over 7 days = Distance after break on a single day Ã— Number of days
Total distance after break over 7 days = 11.6 km Ã— 7
Total distance after break over 7 days = 81.2 km

Therefore, the cyclist covers a total of 81.2 kilometers after resuming from the break over 7 days.

* The cyclist pedals for 50.0 kilometers each day.
* The cyclist takes a break after covering 40 kilometers each day.
* We need to find the distance covered after resuming from the break each day.

To find the distance covered after the break each day, we can use the same approach as in the previous problem:

Distance after break = Total distance - Distance before break
Distance after break = 50.0 km - 40 km
Distance after break = 10 km

Since the cyclist follows the same pattern each day, the distance covered after resuming from the break remains the same for all 7 days.

Therefore, the cyclist covers 10 kilometers after resuming from the break each day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the given information:
* Mia has $41 saved from her birthday.
* She earned an additional $24.7 from babysitting.
* She bought a new book that cost $38.6.

To find out how much money Mia has left after buying the book, we need to:
1. Add her savings and her earnings from babysitting to get her total money.
2. Subtract the cost of the book from her total money.

Step 1: Calculate Mia's total money
* Total money = Savings + Earnings from babysitting
* Total money = $41 + $24.7 = $65.7

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the book from her total money
* Money left = Total money - Cost of the book
* Money left = $65.7 - $38.6 = $27.1

Therefore, Mia has $27.1 left after buying the book.

2. Calculate the total value of the quarters in terms of dimes:
   * Value in dimes = Number of quarters Ã— Value of each quarter in dimes
   * Value in dimes = 29 Ã— 3.0
   * Value in dimes = 87.0 dimes

Therefore, Jenna has the equivalent of 87.0 dimes in her piggy bank.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. First, we'll find your total travel distance after continuing for another 17.2 kilometers. Then, we'll calculate how many more kilometers you need to travel to complete the 48.2-kilometer course.

Given:
- You have already finished a 23.0-kilometer route.
- You plan to continue for another 17.2 kilometers.
- You have a 48.2-kilometer course to finish.

Step 1: Add the finished distance to the planned additional distance.
Total travel distance = Finished distance + Additional distance
Total travel distance = 23.0 km + 17.2 km
Total travel distance = 40.2 km

Step 2: Subtract the total travel distance from the course distance to find the remaining distance.
Remaining distance = Course distance - Total travel distance
Remaining distance = 48.2 km - 40.2 km
Remaining distance = 8.0 km

Therefore, after continuing for another 17.2 kilometers, your total travel distance will be 40.2 kilometers. To complete the 48.2-kilometer course, you will need to travel an additional 8.0 kilometers.

### Answer: You need to travel 8.0 more kilometers to complete the course.</pre>

Given:
- You have already finished a 23.0-kilometer route.
- You plan to add a longer route of 48 kilometers to your total travel distance.

Step 1: Add the finished distance to the planned additional distance.
Total travel distance = Finished distance + Additional distance
Total travel distance = 23.0 km + 48 km
Total travel distance = 71.0 km

Therefore, if you add a longer route of 48 kilometers to your already traveled distance of 23 kilometers, your total travel distance would be 71.0 kilometers in this scenario.

Given:
- Speed = 8.0 miles per hour
- Time = 3.9 hours
- Car cools down by 21 miles of equivalent energy consumption during the break

Step 1: Calculate the distance Bob drove before the break.
Distance = Speed Ã— Time
Distance = 8.0 miles/hour Ã— 3.9 hours
Distance = 31.2 miles

Step 2: Calculate the equivalent distance for the energy remaining in his car after the break.
Remaining energy equivalent distance = Distance driven - Energy lost during the break
Remaining energy equivalent distance = 31.2 miles - 21 miles
Remaining energy equivalent distance = 10.2 miles

Therefore, the equivalent distance for the energy remaining in Bob's car after his break is 10.2 miles.

- The train initially travels for 8 hours at a speed of 47.1 miles per hour.
- The train has to take a detour that reduces the total distance by 21.2 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the initial distance traveled by the train.
initial distance = speed Ã— time
initial distance = 47.1 miles/hour Ã— 8 hours = 376.8 miles

Step 2: Subtract the detour distance from the initial distance.
final distance = initial distance - detour distance
final distance = 376.8 miles - 21.2 miles = 355.6 miles

Therefore, the final distance traveled by the train after the detour is 355.6 miles.

Given:
- Jenny had $48.6 in her savings account initially.
- On her birthday, she received $27 (instead of $26).
- She spent $22 on a new book.

Step 1: Calculate Jenny's new balance after receiving birthday money.
New balance after birthday = Initial balance + Birthday money
New balance after birthday = $48.6 + $27 = $75.6

Step 2: Calculate Jenny's current balance after spending money on the book.
Current balance = New balance after birthday - Money spent on the book
Current balance = $75.6 - $22 = $53.6

Given:
- The car travels at a speed of 46.72 miles per hour.
- The car has been driving for 11.62 hours.
- The car's gas tank indicates that an additional 41 miles can be covered before the gas runs out.

Step 1: Calculate the distance the car has already traveled.
Distance traveled = Speed Ã— Time
Distance traveled = 46.72 miles/hour Ã— 11.62 hours = 542.8864 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance the car can travel by adding the distance already traveled and the additional miles that can be covered before the gas runs out.
Total distance = Distance traveled + Additional miles
Total distance = 542.8864 miles + 41 miles = 583.8864 miles

Therefore, the car can still travel a total of 583.8864 miles.

Given:
- The car travels at a speed of 46.72 miles per hour.
- The car has been driving for 11.62 hours.
- The car's gas tank indicates that an additional 41 miles can be covered before the gas runs out.
- There's a detour that's 26 miles longer than the original route.
- The car started with enough fuel to journey the total calculated miles.

Step 1: Calculate the distance the car has already traveled.
Distance traveled = Speed Ã— Time
Distance traveled = 46.72 miles/hour Ã— 11.62 hours = 542.8864 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance the car can travel by adding the distance already traveled and the additional miles that can be covered before the gas runs out.
Total distance without detour = Distance traveled + Additional miles
Total distance without detour = 542.8864 miles + 41 miles = 583.8864 miles

Step 3: Add the detour distance to the total distance to find the entire journey distance.
Entire journey distance = Total distance without detour + Detour distance
Entire journey distance = 583.8864 miles + 26 miles = 609.8864 miles

Therefore, the entire journey, including the detour, is 609.8864 miles, given that the car started with enough fuel to cover this distance.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, using the information from the previous question.

Given:
- Each shirt is priced at $33.
- Jake buys 2.4 times the price of one shirt in clothing.
- Jake also buys a hat for $19.53.

Step 1: Calculate the amount Jake spent on clothing (from the previous question).
Amount spent on clothing = Price of one shirt Ã— 2.4
Amount spent on clothing = $33 Ã— 2.4 = $79.20

Step 2: Add the cost of the hat to the amount spent on clothing.
Total amount spent = Amount spent on clothing + Cost of the hat
Total amount spent = $79.20 + $19.53
Total amount spent = $98.73

To find out how much money Sarah has in total, we need to:
1. Calculate the total amount she saved from her earnings.
2. Add the money she had in her piggy bank to the total savings.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Sarah saved from her earnings
* Sarah saved $24.71 for every $1 she earned.
* Total savings = Daily earnings Ã— Savings per dollar earned
* Total savings = $38 Ã— $24.71 = $938.98

Step 2: Add the money from her piggy bank to the total savings
* Money in piggy bank = $11.60

Given:
- The cow produced 999.6 liters of milk in 28 days.
- The farmer sold 20 liters of milk to a local cheese producer.

To calculate the remaining milk, we need to subtract the sold milk from the total milk production.

Remaining milk = Total milk production - Sold milk

* Mason had $34 saved from his previous week's allowance.
* This week, he earned an extra $31.4 by doing some extra house chores.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Mason has:
* Total money = Money saved from previous week + Money earned this week
* Total money = $34 + $31.4
* Total money = $65.4

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the information given to find out how much money Mason has in total.

Given:
- Mason had $34 saved from his previous week's allowance.
- This week, he earned an extra $31.4 by doing some extra house chores.
- His grandma gave him another $27.4 as a gift.

Step 1: Calculate the total money Mason has from his allowance and extra chores.
Money from allowance and chores = $34 + $31.4 = $65.4

Step 2: Add the gift money from his grandma to the total from Step 1.
Total money = Money from allowance and chores + Gift money from grandma
Total money = $65.4 + $27.4 = $92.8

Therefore, Mason now has a total of $92.8.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Rachel had 48 dollars initially.
   * She spent 5.5 dollars on a new toy.

2. To find out how much money Rachel has left, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the amount she had initially:
   * Money left = Initial amount - Amount spent
   * Money left = 48 - 5.5
   * Money left = 42.5 dollars

Therefore, Rachel has 42.5 dollars left after buying the new toy.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off in the previous problem.

Given:
- After buying the toy, Rachel had 42.5 dollars left.
- Rachel's mom gave her an additional 23 dollars.

To find out how much money Rachel has now, we need to add the money her mom gave her to the amount she had after buying the toy.

Step 1: Add the money Rachel's mom gave her to the amount she had after buying the toy.
Total money = Money left after buying the toy + Money given by her mom
Total money = 42.5 + 23
Total money = 65.5 dollars

Therefore, Rachel now has 65.5 dollars.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step with the new information.

Given:
- Rachel had 48 dollars initially.
- The toy she bought originally cost 45 dollars.

Step 1: Subtract the cost of the toy from Rachel's initial amount.
Money left = Initial amount - Cost of the toy
Money left = 48 - 45
Money left = 3 dollars

Therefore, if the toy Rachel bought originally cost 45 dollars, she would have 3 dollars left after her purchase.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's use the following steps:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The cyclist travels a total of 506 kilometers.
   * The cyclist takes 11 days to travel this distance.

2. To find the number of kilometers the cyclist travels each day, we need to divide the total distance by the number of days:
   * Kilometers per day = Total distance Ã· Number of days
   * Kilometers per day = 506 Ã· 11

3. Perform the division:
