    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides.

Given:
- Length of the rectangle is 21m
- Width of the rectangle is 37m

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

Calculation:
Perimeter = 2 × (21m + 37m)
Perimeter = 2 × 58m
Perimeter = 116m

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 116m.

        In the previous rectangle question, suppose one of the sides measuring 45m was incorrectly assessed. The actual measurement is found to be 42m. With this new information, what would be the adjusted perimeter of the rectangle?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem using the new information provided.

Given:
- One side of the rectangle that was previously measured as 45m is now found to be 42m.
- The other side measuring 45m remains unchanged.
- The other two sides of the rectangle measure 25m each.

Step 1: Calculate the total length of the two sides measuring 42m and 45m.
Total length of the updated sides = 42m + 45m = 87m

Step 2: Calculate the total length of the two sides measuring 25m.
Total length of 25m sides = 2 × 25m = 50m

Step 3: Calculate the adjusted perimeter by adding the lengths of all four sides.
Adjusted perimeter = Total length of the updated sides + Total length of 25m sides
Adjusted perimeter = 87m + 50m = 137m

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides. 

Given:
- Length of the rectangle = 45m
- Width of the rectangle = 37m

In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal in length. So, there are two sides with a length of 45m and two sides with a length of 37m.

Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 × (45m + 37m)
Perimeter = 2 × 82m
Perimeter = 164m

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 164m.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's think through this step-by-step:

1) A rectangle has two pairs of sides. The opposite sides are equal in length.

2) You mentioned that the length of the rectangle is 20m and all sides are of equal length. This means that the rectangle is actually a square, because in a square, all sides are equal.

3) In a square, the length and width are the same. So, if the length is 20m, the width is also 20m.

4) The perimeter of a rectangle (or a square) is the sum of all its sides. It can be calculated using the formula:

   Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

5) Substituting the values:

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) We know that one side of the rectangle is four times the length of the other side. Let's call the shorter side $x$. Then the longer side is $4x$.

2) We are told that the longer side measures 39 meters. So we can set up an equation:

   $4x = 39$

3) Solving for $x$:

   $x = 39 / 4 = 9.75$

   So the shorter side is 9.75 meters.

4) However, the question asks for the area when the shorter side is 10 meters. So let's calculate the area with the shorter side as 10 meters.

5) The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. If the shorter side is 10 meters, then the longer side is $4 * 10 = 40$ meters.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1) A rectangle has four sides. If the sides are identical, it means that the rectangle is actually a square.

2) In a square, all sides are equal. Let's call the length of each side 's'. We are told that s = 19 meters.

3) The perimeter of a square (or any rectangle) is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. 

4) Since all sides are equal, we can calculate the perimeter by multiplying the length of one side by 4.

   Perimeter = 4 * s
             = 4 * 19
             = 76

        The rectangle mentioned in the previous problem has been resized. The new rectangle now has a length of 19 meters but a width of 6 meters. What is the new total perimeter of the rectangle?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1) We are now dealing with a rectangle, not a square. The length and width are different.

2) We are given that the length of the rectangle is 19 meters and the width is 6 meters.

3) To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides. 

4) In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, there are two sides with length 19 meters and two sides with length 6 meters.

5) The perimeter of the rectangle can be calculated as:

   Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
             = 2 * (19 + 6)
             = 2 * 25
             = 50

Therefore, the new total perimeter of the rectangle is 50 meters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides. 

Given:
- Length of the rectangle is 15m

The perimeter of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:
Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

Plugging in the values:
Perimeter = 2 × (15m + 37m)
Perimeter = 2 × 52m
Perimeter = 104m

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 104 meters.

Step 1: Since the garden is a rectangle, the opposite sides have equal lengths. So, there are two sides measuring 21 feet and two sides measuring 30 feet.

Step 2: Calculate the perimeter by adding the lengths of all four sides.
Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.

Given:
- Length of the rectangle = 49m
- New breadth of the rectangle = 19m

Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth)

Now, let's calculate the new perimeter:

Perimeter = 2 × (49m + 19m)
Perimeter = 2 × 68m
Perimeter = 136m

Therefore, with a length of 49m and a breadth of 19m, the new perimeter of the rectangle is 136m.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the area of the rectangular swimming pool, we need to multiply its length by its width.

Given:
- The length of the pool is 23 meters.
- The width of the pool is 12 meters.

Calculation:
Area = length × width
Area = 23 meters × 12 meters

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we need to use the formula:

Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + width)

Given:
- Length of the rectangle = 39 meters
- Width of the rectangle = 8 meters

Step 1: Add the length and width of the rectangle.
length + width = 39 + 8 = 47 meters

Step 2: Multiply the sum of the length and width by 2 to get the perimeter.
Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 × (39 + 8)
Perimeter = 2 × 47
Perimeter = 94 meters

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 94 meters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem using the same method as before, but with the updated width of 23 meters.

Given:
- Length of the rectangle = 39 meters
- Width of the rectangle = 23 meters

Step 1: Add the length and width of the rectangle.
length + width = 39 + 23 = 62 meters

Step 2: Multiply the sum of the length and width by 2 to get the perimeter.
Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 × (39 + 23)
Perimeter = 2 × 62
Perimeter = 124 meters

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we need to use the formula:

Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + width)

Given:
- The length of the rectangle is 32m.
- The width of the rectangle is also 32m.

Now, let's calculate the perimeter:

Perimeter = 2 × (32m + 32m)
Perimeter = 2 × 64m
Perimeter = 128m

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 128m.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        The length of the rectangle from the previous problem remains the same, but the width of the rectangle is now adjusted to 13m. What is the new perimeter of this rectangle?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we had a rectangle with a length of 32m and a width of 32m. Now, the width has been changed to 13m, while the length remains the same.

To find the new perimeter of the rectangle, we will use the same formula as before:

Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + width)

Given:
- The length of the rectangle is still 32m.
- The new width of the rectangle is 13m.

Let's calculate the new perimeter:

Perimeter = 2 × (32m + 13m)
Perimeter = 2 × 45m
Perimeter = 90m

Therefore, the new perimeter of the rectangle with a length of 32m and a width of 13m is 90m.
