        A tech store had 130 computers in stock. They received a new shipment of 643 computers. How many computers does the store have now?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The tech store initially had 130 computers in stock.
   * They received a new shipment of 643 computers.

2. To find the total number of computers the store has now, we need to add the number of computers they had initially to the number of computers they received in the new shipment.

3. Add the initial stock and the new shipment:
   * Total computers = Initial stock + New shipment
   * Total computers = 130 + 643
   * Total computers = &lt;&lt;130+643=773&gt;&gt;773

Therefore, the tech store now has 773 computers.

### Answer: 773</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off in the previous problem. We know that the tech store had 773 computers after receiving the new shipment. Now, we need to subtract the number of computers sold from the total.

Given:
- The tech store had 773 computers before the purchase rush.
- 186 computers were sold during the purchase rush.

Step 1: Subtract the number of computers sold from the total number of computers.
Remaining computers = Total computers - Computers sold
Remaining computers = 773 - 186
Remaining computers = &lt;&lt;773-186=587&gt;&gt;587

Therefore, the tech store has 587 computers left after the purchase rush.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The tech store initially had 130 computers in stock.
   * They received a new shipment of 737 computers (instead of 643).

2. To find the total number of computers the store has now, we need to add the number of computers they had initially to the number of computers they received in the new shipment.

3. Add the initial stock and the new shipment:
   * Total computers = Initial stock + New shipment
   * Total computers = 130 + 737
   * Total computers = &lt;&lt;130+737=867&gt;&gt;867

Therefore, if the tech store received 737 computers in the new shipment instead of 643, they would have had a total of 867 computers.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* 645 guests have already confirmed their attendance
* An additional 24 guests decided to join at the last minute

To find the total number of guests expected to attend the party, we need to add the number of guests who confirmed earlier and the number of guests who decided to join at the last minute.

Total guests = Confirmed guests + Last-minute guests
Total guests = 645 + 24
Total guests = 669

Therefore, 669 guests are expected to attend the party.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information given for this different party:
* Initially, 830 guests confirmed their attendance
* An additional 24 guests decided to join at the last minute

To calculate the total number of guests expected to attend this event, we need to add the number of initially confirmed guests and the number of last-minute guests.

Total guests = Initially confirmed guests + Last-minute guests
Total guests = 830 + 24
Total guests = 854

Therefore, 854 guests are now expected to attend this different event.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the amount of toothpaste Joe used in the morning and the amount he used later.

Given:
- In the morning, Joe used 393 milliliters of toothpaste.
- Later, he used another 397 milliliters of toothpaste.

To find the total amount of toothpaste used, we add the two amounts together:

393 milliliters + 397 milliliters = &lt;&lt;393+397=790&gt;&gt;790 milliliters

Therefore, Joe used a total of 790 milliliters of toothpaste.

### Answer: 790 milliliters</pre>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find out how much toothpaste Joe actually used during the day.

Given:
- Joe used a total of 790 milliliters of toothpaste throughout the day.
- By the end of the day, he managed to save 172 milliliters of toothpaste.

To calculate the amount of toothpaste Joe ended up using, we need to subtract the amount he saved from the total amount he used:

790 milliliters (total used) - 172 milliliters (amount saved) = &lt;&lt;790-172=618&gt;&gt;618 milliliters

So, Joe ended up using 618 milliliters of toothpaste for the day.

* Baker Bob starts the day with 747 cookies.
* He sells 382 cookies throughout the morning.

To find out how many cookies Bob has left, we need to subtract the number of cookies he sold from the number of cookies he started with.

747 - 382 = 365

* Baker Bob starts the day with 747 cookies.
* He sells 382 cookies throughout the morning.
* In the afternoon, a school group buys 33 more cookies.

First, let's find out how many cookies Bob had left after selling 382 cookies in the morning:
747 - 382 = 365

Now, we need to subtract the number of cookies the school group bought from the remaining cookies:
365 - 33 = 332

Therefore, Bob has 332 cookies left after the school group's purchase.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information based on the new scenario:
* Baker Bob starts the day with 747 cookies (instead of 747).
* He sells 711 cookies throughout the day.

To find out how many cookies Bob has left, we need to subtract the number of cookies he sold from the number of cookies he started with.

747 - 711 = 36

However, there's a problem here. If Bob started with 747 cookies and sold 711 cookies, he would have only 36 cookies left. But you mentioned that he sold more cookies than he started with, which is not possible.

In this case, Bob would have a negative number of cookies left, which doesn't make sense in the real world.

747 - 711 = 36

Therefore, the question is invalid because Bob cannot sell more cookies than he has in his bakery.

- The dictionary originally has 744 pages.
- You plan to add 120 more pages of advanced vocabulary and jargon.

New total pages = Original pages + Pages added
New total pages = 744 + 120
New total pages = &lt;&lt;744+120=864&gt;&gt;864

Therefore, after adding 120 more pages, the dictionary will have a total of 864 pages.

Given:
- The dictionary actually has 610 pages in total, not 744.

Number of pages left to read = Total pages - Pages read
Number of pages left to read = 610 - 318
Number of pages left to read = &lt;&lt;610-318=292&gt;&gt;292

* Bill had 167 sleeping bags in stock before the new shipment.
* He received a new shipment of 69 sleeping bags.

To find the total number of sleeping bags Bill has now, we need to add the number of sleeping bags he had in stock and the number of sleeping bags in the new shipment.

Sleeping bags in stock: 167
Sleeping bags in the new shipment: 69

Total sleeping bags = Sleeping bags in stock + Sleeping bags in the new shipment
Total sleeping bags = 167 + 69 = 236

* Bill had 167 sleeping bags in stock.
* He received a new shipment of 69 sleeping bags.
* He expected to have 832 sleeping bags in total according to his yearly inventory check.

First, let's calculate the actual total number of sleeping bags Bill has:
* Actual total sleeping bags = Sleeping bags in stock + Sleeping bags in the new shipment
* Actual total sleeping bags = 167 + 69 = 236

Now, to find the number of missing sleeping bags, we need to subtract the actual total from the expected total:
* Missing sleeping bags = Expected total - Actual total
* Missing sleeping bags = 832 - 236 = 596

Therefore, 596 sleeping bags are missing from Bill's expected inventory.

* He received a new shipment of 69 sleeping bags.

To find the total number of sleeping bags Bill has now, we need to add the number of sleeping bags he had in stock and the number of sleeping bags in the new shipment.

Sleeping bags in stock: 319
Sleeping bags in the new shipment: 69

Total sleeping bags = Sleeping bags in stock + Sleeping bags in the new shipment
Total sleeping bags = 319 + 69 = 388

To find the total number of apple trees the farmer has, we need to add the initial number of trees to the newly planted trees.

Initial apple trees + Newly planted apple trees = Total apple trees
696 + 203 = 899

Therefore, the farmer has a total of 899 apple trees in his orchard.

Given:
* The farmer had a total of 899 apple trees in his orchard.
* He decides to clear 188 apple trees for new crops.

To find the number of apple trees the farmer has left, we need to subtract the cleared trees from the total number of trees.

Total apple trees - Cleared apple trees = Remaining apple trees
899 - 188 = 711

So, after clearing 188 apple trees, the farmer has 711 apple trees left in his orchard.

* Due to the unusual planetary alignment, Blaze breathed an additional 586 flames.
* After resting, Blaze's flames diminished by 879.

First, let's calculate the total number of flames Blaze breathed before resting:
Total flames before resting = Initial flames + Additional flames
Total flames before resting = 297 + 586 = 883

Now, we can subtract the number of flames that diminished during the resting period from the total flames:
Remaining flames = Total flames before resting - Flames diminished during rest
Remaining flames = 883 - 879 = 4

        A toy shop has a total of 477 teddy bears. Today, they received a new shipment containing 260 more teddy bears. How many teddy bears does the toy shop have in total now?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* The toy shop initially had 477 teddy bears.
* They received a new shipment of 260 teddy bears.

To find the total number of teddy bears the toy shop has now, we need to add the number of teddy bears they had initially to the number of teddy bears in the new shipment.

Total teddy bears = Initial number of teddy bears + Number of teddy bears in the new shipment
Total teddy bears = 477 + 260
Total teddy bears = &lt;&lt;477+260=737&gt;&gt;737

Therefore, the toy shop now has a total of 737 teddy bears.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's update the information we have:
* The toy shop had 737 teddy bears after the previous shipment.
* They decided to add 16 special edition teddy bears to their collection.

To find the new total number of teddy bears the toy shop has, we need to add the number of special edition teddy bears to the previous total.

New total teddy bears = Previous total teddy bears + Number of special edition teddy bears
New total teddy bears = 737 + 16
New total teddy bears = &lt;&lt;737+16=753&gt;&gt;753

Therefore, after adding the special edition teddy bears, the toy shop now has a total of 753 teddy bears.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information:
* The toy shop initially had 621 teddy bears.
* They received a new shipment of 260 teddy bears.

We will use the same method as before to find the total number of teddy bears the toy shop has now.

Total teddy bears = Initial number of teddy bears + Number of teddy bears in the new shipment
Total teddy bears = 621 + 260
Total teddy bears = &lt;&lt;621+260=881&gt;&gt;881

So, if the toy shop originally had 621 teddy bears before receiving the shipment of 260 teddy bears, they would now have a total of 881 teddy bears.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* The restaurant started the week with 573 oranges.
* They used 228 oranges throughout the week.

To find out how many oranges they have left, we need to subtract the number of oranges used from the initial number of oranges.

Oranges left = Initial number of oranges - Oranges used
Oranges left = 573 - 228
Oranges left = &lt;&lt;573-228=345&gt;&gt;345

Therefore, the restaurant has 345 oranges left now.

* The restaurant started the week with 573 oranges.
* They used 228 oranges throughout the week.
* After using the oranges, they received a fresh delivery of 142 oranges.

To find the total number of oranges the restaurant has now, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of oranges left after using 228 oranges.
2. Add the number of oranges from the fresh delivery to the remaining oranges.

Step 1: Oranges left after use = Initial number of oranges - Oranges used
Oranges left after use = 573 - 228 = &lt;&lt;573-228=345&gt;&gt;345

Step 2: Total oranges now = Oranges left after use + Fresh delivery of oranges
Total oranges now = 345 + 142 = &lt;&lt;345+142=487&gt;&gt;487

Therefore, the restaurant now has a total of 487 oranges.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this new scenario, let's organize the updated information:
* The restaurant started with 573 oranges.
* 20 oranges were deemed unsuitable for juicing.

To find out how many oranges they have for producing fresh juice, we need to subtract the unsuitable oranges from the initial number of oranges.

Oranges for juicing = Initial number of oranges - Unsuitable oranges
Oranges for juicing = 573 - 20
Oranges for juicing = &lt;&lt;573-20=553&gt;&gt;553

Therefore, in this scenario, the restaurant would have 553 oranges for producing fresh juice.

To find out how many stickers Kevin has left, we need to subtract the number of stickers he used from the total number of stickers he started with.

To find the total number of stickers Kevin has now, we need to add the number of stickers he had left to the number of stickers he won.

Total stickers now = Stickers left + Stickers won
Total stickers now = 163 + 806
Total stickers now = 969

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* Captain Redbeard found 211 gold coins in a hidden treasure chest.
* His first mate found 651 gold coins in a different location on the same island.

To find the total number of gold coins they found, we need to add the number of coins found by Captain Redbeard and his first mate.

Total gold coins = Captain Redbeard's coins + First mate's coins
Total gold coins = 211 + 651
Total gold coins = &lt;&lt;211+651=862&gt;&gt;862

Therefore, Captain Redbeard and his first mate found a total of 862 gold coins on the deserted island.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the information from the previous question and the new information provided.

Given:
- Captain Redbeard and his first mate found a total of 862 gold coins on the deserted island.
- The crew had already secured 824 gold coins from a previous raid.

To find out how many more gold coins they got from the deserted island compared to the coins from the previous raid, we need to subtract the number of coins from the previous raid from the number of coins found on the deserted island.

Difference in gold coins = Coins from deserted island - Coins from previous raid
Difference in gold coins = 862 - 824
Difference in gold coins = &lt;&lt;862-824=38&gt;&gt;38

Therefore, Captain Redbeard and his first mate found 38 more gold coins on the deserted island compared to the coins secured from the previous raid.

* Captain Redbeard found 211 gold coins in a hidden treasure chest.
* His first mate found 425 gold coins in a different location on the same island.

To find the total number of gold coins they found, we need to add the number of coins found by Captain Redbeard and his first mate.

Total gold coins = Captain Redbeard's coins + First mate's coins
Total gold coins = 211 + 425
Total gold coins = &lt;&lt;211+425=636&gt;&gt;636

Therefore, with the updated information, Captain Redbeard and his first mate found a total of 636 gold coins on the deserted island.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Initially, there were 976 registered dogs in the city.
   * 586 dogs moved away with their owners over the year.

2. To find the number of dogs still registered in the city, we need to subtract the number of dogs that moved away from the original number of registered dogs.

3. Calculation:
   * Number of dogs still registered = Original number of dogs - Dogs that moved away
   * Number of dogs still registered = 976 - 586

1. Understand the given information:
   * In the original scenario, there were 976 registered dogs in the city.
   * However, in this new scenario, there are 465 fewer dogs than in the original scenario.
   * We need to find the number of dogs registered in the city before the recent pet adoption event and before any dogs moved away.

2. To find the number of dogs registered in the city in the new scenario, we need to subtract 465 from the original number of registered dogs.

3. Calculation:
   * Number of dogs registered in the new scenario = Original number of dogs - 465
   * Number of dogs registered in the new scenario = 976 - 465

Given:
- The first sanctuary has 119 tigers after the migration.
- The second sanctuary has the same number of tigers as the first sanctuary.

Step 1: Determine the number of tigers in the second sanctuary.
Since the second sanctuary has the same number of tigers as the first sanctuary after the migration, the number of tigers in the second sanctuary is also 119.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tigers in both sanctuaries.
Total tigers = Tigers in the first sanctuary + Tigers in the second sanctuary
Total tigers = 119 + 119
Total tigers = 238

Step 1: Calculate the distance the rocket has already traveled.
Distance traveled = Initial height - Current height
Distance traveled = 103 meters - 50 meters = 53 meters

Step 2: Calculate the total distance the rocket will travel.

Step 1: Add the number of rooms in the main building and the secondary buildings.
Total rooms = Rooms in the main building + Rooms in the secondary buildings
Total rooms = 189 + 546 = 735

Therefore, the castle has a total of 735 rooms.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the number of rooms still available in the castle, we need to subtract the number of damaged rooms from the total number of rooms.

Given:
- The castle has a total of 735 rooms (from the previous problem).
- 608 rooms across the main and secondary buildings were damaged and are temporarily unusable.

Step 1: Subtract the number of damaged rooms from the total number of rooms.
Available rooms = Total rooms - Damaged rooms

To find the total number of rooms in the castle, we need to add the number of rooms in the main building and the secondary buildings.

Step 1: Add the number of rooms in the main building and the secondary buildings.
Total rooms = Rooms in the main building + Rooms in the secondary buildings
Total rooms = 189 + 87 = 276

Given:
* The astronaut has 670 kilograms of fuel left in his spaceship.
* The other spaceship needs 937 kilograms of fuel to return to Earth.

To find out how much additional fuel the other spaceship needs, we should subtract the leftover fuel from the astronaut's spaceship from the required fuel:

Additional fuel needed = Required fuel - Leftover fuel
Additional fuel needed = 937 kg - 670 kg
Additional fuel needed = &lt;&lt;937-670=267&gt;&gt;267 kg

Therefore, the other spaceship needs an additional 267 kilograms of fuel to return to Earth.

To find out how much fuel the astronaut has left in this scenario, we need to subtract the used fuel from the initial amount of fuel:

Remaining fuel = Initial fuel - Used fuel
Remaining fuel = 866 kg - 632 kg

1. Understand the given information:
   * The train started its journey with 796 passengers.
   * At the first stop, 533 passengers left the train.

2. To find the number of passengers still on the train, we need to subtract the number of passengers who left the train from the total number of passengers at the start of the journey.

3. Calculation:
   * Passengers still on the train = Total passengers at the start - Passengers who left
   * Passengers still on the train = 796 - 533
   * Passengers still on the train = &lt;&lt;796-533=263&gt;&gt;263

To find the number of passengers still on the train, we need to subtract the number of passengers who left the train from the total number of passengers at the start of the journey.

Calculation:
- Passengers still on the train = Total passengers at the start - Passengers who left
- Passengers still on the train = 908 - 533

* In this new scenario, only 24 more strawberries grew as the season progressed.

To find the total number of strawberries in the farm now, we need to add the initial number of strawberries and the additional strawberries that grew.

Initial strawberries + Additional strawberries = Total strawberries now
419 + 24 = &lt;&lt;419+24=443&gt;&gt;443

Therefore, in this new scenario, there are now 443 strawberries in total in the farm.

Given:
- There are 312 white mice in the pet store.
- There are 403 brown mice in the pet store initially.
- The pet store received a shipment of 268 more brown mice.

Step 1: Calculate the new total of brown mice after the shipment.
New total of brown mice = Initial brown mice + Additional brown mice from the shipment
New total of brown mice = 403 + 268 = 671

Step 2: Add the number of white mice and the new total of brown mice.
Total mice after the shipment = White mice + New total of brown mice
Total mice after the shipment = 312 + 671 = 983

2. To find the total number of cows on the farm after the purchase, we need to add the number of cows the farm already has to the number of cows the farmer bought.

3. Add the initial number of cows and the purchased cows:
   * Total cows = Initial cows + Purchased cows
   * Total cows = 473 + 125

- Initially, the galaxy was thought to have 672 billion stars.
- Astronomers recently discovered an additional 134 billion stars in an unobserved section of the galaxy.

To find the total number of stars now known to exist in the galaxy, we need to add the initial number of stars and the newly discovered stars.

Step 1: Add the initial number of stars and the newly discovered stars.
Total stars = Initial stars + Newly discovered stars
Total stars = 672 billion + 134 billion
Total stars = 806 billion

- 361 clowns had to leave after the first day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of clowns.
Total clowns = Clowns in the afternoon show + Clowns in the evening show
Total clowns = 120 + 350 = 470

Given:
- The sunglasses company started with 140 pairs of sunglasses.
- Over the summer, 79 pairs were sold.
- After selling the sunglasses, the company added 288 new pairs to their inventory.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pairs of sunglasses left after selling 79 pairs.
Pairs of sunglasses left = Initial number of pairs - Number of pairs sold
Pairs of sunglasses left = 140 - 79 = &lt;&lt;140-79=61&gt;&gt;61

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pairs of sunglasses in stock after adding 288 new pairs.
Total pairs of sunglasses in stock = Pairs of sunglasses left + New pairs added
Total pairs of sunglasses in stock = 61 + 288 = &lt;&lt;61+288=349&gt;&gt;349

To find the number of shirts that are not of Brand X or Brand Y, we need to subtract the number of Brand X and Brand Y shirts from the total number of shirts.

Total number of shirts = 980
Number of Brand X shirts = 89
Number of Brand Y shirts = 707

Number of shirts not of Brand X or Brand Y = Total number of shirts - (Number of Brand X shirts + Number of Brand Y shirts)
Number of shirts not of Brand X or Brand Y = 980 - (89 + 707)
Number of shirts not of Brand X or Brand Y = 980 - 796

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the information from the previous situation and the new information provided.

Given:
- There were originally 632 passengers on both trains combined.
- 240 passengers got off at the next station from both trains combined.

Step 1: Subtract the number of passengers who got off at the next station from the total number of passengers on both trains.
Remaining passengers = Total passengers - Passengers who got off
Remaining passengers = 632 - 240 = 392

Therefore, there are 392 passengers still on the two trains after 240 passengers got off at the next station.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given:
- Train A is carrying 231 passengers (updated).
- Train B is carrying 254 passengers (unchanged).

Step 1: Add the number of passengers on Train A and Train B.
Total passengers = Passengers on Train A + Passengers on Train B
Total passengers = 231 + 254 = 485

Therefore, with the updated number of passengers on Train A, there are a total of 485 passengers on the two trains.

1. We start with the number 892.
2. The magic spell causes the number to lose 172 from its count.
3. To find the new number, we need to subtract 172 from 892.

Calculation:
892 - 172 = &lt;&lt;892-172=720&gt;&gt;720

   - 892 - 172 = &lt;&lt;892-172=720&gt;&gt;720
   - So, the first number becomes 720 after the magic spell.

2. The second number, 896, undergoes the same magic spell and loses the same amount as the first number's new value (720).
   - To find the new count of the second number, we subtract 720 from 896.
   - 896 - 720 = &lt;&lt;896-720=176&gt;&gt;176

4. To find the new number, we need to subtract 776 from 892.

Calculation:
892 - 776 = &lt;&lt;892-776=116&gt;&gt;116

Given:
- Initially, the factory produced 642 tables.
- 544 tables were discarded due to quality issues.
- After the issue was resolved, the factory produced an additional 329 tables.

Step 1: Calculate the number of tables that remained from the initial production.
Remaining tables from initial production = Total produced tables - Discarded tables
Remaining tables from initial production = 642 - 544 = 98

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tables produced that month by adding the remaining tables from the initial production and the additional tables produced after the issue was resolved.
Total tables produced = Remaining tables from initial production + Additional tables produced
Total tables produced = 98 + 329 = 427

To find the remaining tables, we subtract the discarded tables from the total produced tables:

Remaining tables = Total produced tables - Discarded tables
Remaining tables = 824 - 544
Remaining tables = 280

To find the total number of colored pencils in the art class now, we need to add the initial number of pencils to the number of pencils added.

Initial number of pencils: 91
Number of pencils added: 738

Total number of pencils = Initial number of pencils + Number of pencils added
Total number of pencils = 91 + 738 = &lt;&lt;91+738=829&gt;&gt;829

Given:
* From the previous problem, we know that there were 829 colored pencils in the art class after the first batch was added.
* Now, an additional donation of 67 colored pencils is received.

To find the new total number of colored pencils in the art class, we need to add the number of pencils from the previous total to the number of pencils in the additional donation.

Previous total number of pencils: 829
Number of pencils in the additional donation: 67

New total number of pencils = Previous total number of pencils + Number of pencils in the additional donation
New total number of pencils = 829 + 67 = &lt;&lt;829+67=896&gt;&gt;896

Step 1: Add the beads from the first box and the recently discovered box.
Total beads = Beads in the first box + Beads in the recently discovered box
Total beads = 261 + 551
Total beads = 812

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * You initially have 117 bottles of juice in your store.
   * You decided to add 2 more bottles of a new flavor to your collection.

2. To find the total number of bottles after adding the new flavor, we need to add the initial number of bottles and the newly added bottles:
   * Total bottles = Initial bottles + Newly added bottles
   * Total bottles = 117 + 2
   * Total bottles = 119

Therefore, after adding 2 bottles of the new flavor, you now have 119 bottles of juice in your store.

   * During the day, you sold some bottles and added 2 new bottles of a new flavor.
   * At the end of the day, you have a total of 119 bottles in your store.

2. To find the number of bottles sold, we need to subtract the number of bottles at the end of the day from the number of bottles in the morning, and then add the number of newly added bottles:
   * Bottles sold = Morning bottles - Evening bottles + Newly added bottles
   * Bottles sold = 471 - 119 + 2

- You have a total of 885 TV episodes to binge watch.
- You've already watched 157 episodes.

To calculate the remaining episodes:
Remaining episodes = Total episodes - Watched episodes
Remaining episodes = 885 - 157 = 728

- Initially, you had a total of 885 episodes.
- You watched 157 episodes.
- After watching those episodes, you discovered an additional 208 episodes.

To find the number of episodes left to watch, we need to:
1. Calculate the remaining episodes from the original total.
2. Add the newly discovered episodes to the remaining episodes.

Step 1: Remaining episodes from the original total
Remaining episodes = Original total - Watched episodes
Remaining episodes = 885 - 157 = 728

Step 2: Add the newly discovered episodes to the remaining episodes
Total remaining episodes = Remaining episodes + Newly discovered episodes
Total remaining episodes = 728 + 208 = 936

* The glassmaker initially has 330 regular sized windows.
* The glassmaker decides to make 642 additional larger windows for a commercial order.

Now, let's find the total number of windows the glassmaker has after completing the order:

Total windows = Initial regular sized windows + Additional larger windows
Total windows = 330 + 642
Total windows = 972

Therefore, after completing the commercial order, the glassmaker has a total of 972 windows.

* The glassmaker had 972 windows after completing the commercial order.
* One of the clients returns 604 windows because they were the incorrect size.

To find the updated total number of windows the glassmaker has, we need to subtract the returned windows from the previous total:

Updated total windows = Previous total windows - Returned windows
Updated total windows = 972 - 604
Updated total windows = 368

So, after the client returns 604 windows, the glassmaker now has a total of 368 windows.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bed-sheets left after accommodating some participants.
Bed-sheets left after initial use = Total bed-sheets at start - Used bed-sheets

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* Amy initially had 877 earrings in her shop.
* She recently sold 31 earrings.

To find out how many earrings are left in her shop, we need to subtract the number of earrings sold from the initial number of earrings.

Earrings left = Initial number of earrings - Number of earrings sold
Earrings left = 877 - 31
Earrings left = &lt;&lt;877-31=846&gt;&gt;846

Therefore, after selling 31 earrings, Amy has 846 earrings left in her shop.

Given:
* Amy initially had 877 earrings in her shop.
* She recently sold 31 earrings.
* After selling the earrings, she receives a new shipment of 33 earrings.

Step 1: Calculate the number of earrings left after selling 31 earrings.
Earrings left after selling = Initial number of earrings - Number of earrings sold
Earrings left after selling = 877 - 31 = &lt;&lt;877-31=846&gt;&gt;846

Step 2: Calculate the total number of earrings in Amy's shop after receiving the new shipment.
Total earrings = Earrings left after selling + Number of earrings in the new shipment
Total earrings = 846 + 33 = &lt;&lt;846+33=879&gt;&gt;879

Therefore, after selling 31 earrings and receiving a new shipment of 33 earrings, Amy now has 879 earrings in her shop.

* Sarah initially had 207 erasers in her collection.
* She acquired an additional 590 erasers at a recent collector's meet.

To find the total number of erasers in Sarah's collection now, we need to add the number of erasers she had initially to the number of erasers she acquired recently.

Initial number of erasers: 207
Additional erasers acquired: 590

Total erasers = Initial number of erasers + Additional erasers acquired
Total erasers = 207 + 590 = &lt;&lt;207+590=797&gt;&gt;797

Given:
* Sarah had 797 erasers in her collection after the first collector's meet.
* She acquired an additional 139 erasers at another collector's meet.

To find the total number of erasers in Sarah's collection now, we need to add the number of erasers she had after the first meet to the number of erasers she acquired at the second meet.

Erasers after the first meet: 797
Additional erasers acquired at the second meet: 139

Total erasers = Erasers after the first meet + Additional erasers acquired at the second meet
Total erasers = 797 + 139 = &lt;&lt;797+139=936&gt;&gt;936

To find the total number of erasers in Sarah's collection after the first meet, we need to add the number of erasers she had initially to the number of erasers she acquired at the first meet.

Initial number of erasers: 292
Additional erasers acquired at the first meet: 590

Total erasers after the first meet = Initial number of erasers + Additional erasers acquired at the first meet
Total erasers after the first meet = 292 + 590 = &lt;&lt;292+590=882&gt;&gt;882

* After exchanging some animals with another zoo, the number of animals became 341.
* We calculated that the zoo lost 86 animals.
* There were initially 848 animals in the reserve section of the zoo.

To find out how many animals are left in the reserve section, we need to subtract the number of animals the zoo lost from the initial number of animals in the reserve section.

Animals left in the reserve section = Initial number of animals in the reserve section - Animals lost by the zoo
Animals left in the reserve section = 848 - 86

To find the number of doors in the warehouse now, we need to subtract the number of doors removed from the initial number of doors.

Doors now = Initial doors - Doors removed
Doors now = 107 - 32 = &lt;&lt;107-32=75&gt;&gt;75

Therefore, after the renovation, there are 75 doors in the warehouse.

Total cups of hot chocolate = Cups sold in November + Cups sold in December
Total cups of hot chocolate = 193 + 696

* In December, the cafe sold 696 cups of hot chocolate.
* The cafe accidentally gave away 50 cups of hot chocolate without charging.

To find the number of paid cups of hot chocolate sold during the winter season, we need to subtract the number of cups given away for free from the total cups sold in November and December.

Total cups of hot chocolate sold = 193 + 696 = &lt;&lt;193+696=889&gt;&gt;889
Cups of hot chocolate given away for free = 50

Paid cups of hot chocolate = Total cups sold - Cups given away for free
Paid cups of hot chocolate = 889 - 50
Paid cups of hot chocolate = &lt;&lt;889-50=839&gt;&gt;839

Given:
* The nearby forest saw the same reduction in monkey population as the jungle.
* The jungle's current monkey population is 298.

Step 1: Calculate the current monkey population in the nearby forest.
Current number of monkeys in the forest = 298 (since the reduction is the same as in the jungle)

Step 2: Calculate the total number of monkeys in both the jungle and the forest.
Total number of monkeys = Current number of monkeys in the jungle + Current number of monkeys in the forest
Total number of monkeys = 298 + 298 = &lt;&lt;298+298=596&gt;&gt;596

To find the current number of monkeys in the jungle, we need to subtract the number of monkeys that were lost from the updated initial population.

Current number of monkeys = Updated initial number of monkeys - Number of monkeys lost
Current number of monkeys = 457 - 454 = &lt;&lt;457-454=3&gt;&gt;3

Therefore, if there were initially 457 monkeys in the jungle and the population decreased by 454, there would be only 3 monkeys left in the jungle.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cloned aliens.
Cloned aliens = Number of remaining aliens
Cloned aliens = 34

Step 2: Calculate the total number of aliens on planet Zeta after cloning.
Total aliens after cloning = Remaining aliens + Cloned aliens

Total cucumbers = 436 + 537
Total cucumbers = 973

Therefore, the greenhouse owner now has 973 cucumbers in the greenhouse.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the new information:

1. Understand the updated scenario:
   * There were originally 636 cucumbers in the greenhouse.
   * In this case, 264 cucumbers were damaged and removed due to a pest attack.

2. To find the number of cucumbers remaining, we need to subtract the damaged cucumbers from the original number:
   * Remaining cucumbers = Original number of cucumbers - Damaged cucumbers
   * Remaining cucumbers = 636 - 264
   * Remaining cucumbers = 372

Therefore, if 264 cucumbers had been damaged by pests, 372 cucumbers would remain in the greenhouse.

* Captain Scallywag's treasure chest contains:
  - 206 shiny sapphires
  - 312 glistening emeralds
* We need to find the total number of precious stones in the treasure chest.

Now, let's calculate the total:
* Total precious stones = Number of sapphires + Number of emeralds
* Total precious stones = 206 + 312
* Total precious stones = &lt;&lt;206+312=518&gt;&gt;518

        A daring pirate, Captain Scallywag, has a treasure chest filled with 206 shiny sapphires and 312 glistening emeralds. But amidst a dangerous sea-storm, he loses a tragic amount of 506 precious stones to the sea. How many precious stones does Captain Scallywag have left in his treasure chest now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the given information:
* Initially, Captain Scallywag's treasure chest contained:
  - 206 shiny sapphires
  - 312 glistening emeralds
* During the sea-storm, he lost 506 precious stones.
* We need to find the number of precious stones left in the treasure chest.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:
1. Find the total number of precious stones initially in the treasure chest:
   * Total precious stones = Number of sapphires + Number of emeralds
   * Total precious stones = 206 + 312
   * Total precious stones = &lt;&lt;206+312=518&gt;&gt;518

2. Calculate the number of precious stones left after losing 506 stones:
   * Remaining precious stones = Total precious stones - Lost precious stones
   * Remaining precious stones = 518 - 506
   * Remaining precious stones = &lt;&lt;518-506=12&gt;&gt;12

Therefore, after losing 506 precious stones to the sea during the storm, Captain Scallywag has 12 precious stones left in his treasure chest.

Given:
* Captain Scallywag's treasure chest contains:
  - 426 shiny sapphires (updated from 206)
  - 312 glistening emeralds

To find the total number of precious stones in the treasure chest, we need to add the number of sapphires and emeralds.

Calculation:
* Total precious stones = Number of sapphires + Number of emeralds
* Total precious stones = 426 + 312
* Total precious stones = &lt;&lt;426+312=738&gt;&gt;738

Therefore, with the updated number of sapphires, Captain Scallywag is starting with a total of 738 precious stones in his treasure chest.

* The store has a total space to accommodate 714 jackets.
* Currently, there are 307 jackets in the store.
* An additional 262 jackets are added from a new shipment.

First, let's find the total number of jackets in the store after the new shipment:
* Total jackets after shipment = Current jackets + New shipment jackets
* Total jackets after shipment = 307 + 262
* Total jackets after shipment = &lt;&lt;307+262=569&gt;&gt;569

Now, to find how many more jackets the store can accommodate, we need to subtract the total jackets after the shipment from the store's total capacity:
* Additional jackets the store can accommodate = Total store capacity - Total jackets after shipment
* Additional jackets the store can accommodate = 714 - 569
* Additional jackets the store can accommodate = &lt;&lt;714-569=145&gt;&gt;145

To find the total number of jackets in the store now, we need to add the initial number of jackets and the number of jackets from the new shipment:

* Total jackets = Initial jackets + New shipment jackets
* Total jackets = 432 + 262

To find out how far the spaceship is from its original starting point, we need to:
1. Calculate the total distance traveled forward.
2. Subtract the distance traveled backwards from the total distance traveled forward.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled forward.
Total forward distance = 843 light years + 23 light years
Total forward distance = 866 light years

Step 2: Subtract the distance traveled backwards from the total distance traveled forward.
Distance from starting point = Total forward distance - Backward distance
Distance from starting point = 866 light years - 308 light years
Distance from starting point = 558 light years

        A farmer has 542 acres of land. He sold 398 acres of his land. How much land does he have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's use the given information:
* The farmer initially had 542 acres of land.
* He sold 398 acres of his land.

To find out how much land the farmer has left, we need to subtract the sold land from the initial land:

Land left = Initial land - Sold land
Land left = 542 - 398 = 144

Therefore, the farmer has 144 acres of land left.

### Answer: 144 acres</pre>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">I apologize for the confusion. Let's solve the problem with the updated information:

Given:
* The farmer initially had 542 acres of land.
* He sold 188 acres of his land (instead of 398 acres).

To calculate the remaining land, we subtract the sold land from the initial land:

Land left = Initial land - Sold land
Land left = 542 - 188 = 354

So, with the corrected information, the farmer has 354 acres of land left.

Step 1: Add the number of green grapes and red grapes.
Total grapes = Green grapes + Red grapes
Total grapes = 140 + 377 = &lt;&lt;140+377=517&gt;&gt;517

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of grapes left, we need to subtract the number of grapes bought by the customer from the total number of grapes.

Given:
- There are 140 green grapes in one stall.
- There are 377 red grapes in another stall.
- A customer bought 318 grapes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of grapes before the purchase.
Total grapes before purchase = Green grapes + Red grapes
Total grapes before purchase = 140 + 377 = &lt;&lt;140+377=517&gt;&gt;517

Step 2: Subtract the number of grapes bought by the customer from the total grapes.
Grapes left = Total grapes before purchase - Grapes bought by the customer
Grapes left = 517 - 318 = &lt;&lt;517-318=199&gt;&gt;199

Given:
- There are 354 green grapes in one stall (updated from 140).
- There are 377 red grapes in another stall (unchanged).

Total grapes = Green grapes + Red grapes
Total grapes = 354 + 377 = &lt;&lt;354+377=731&gt;&gt;731

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The manufacturer initially has 338 pairs of binoculars in the warehouse.
* An additional 591 pairs of binoculars are produced.

To find the total number of binoculars, we need to add the initial number of binoculars in the warehouse to the number of binoculars produced.

Initial binoculars in the warehouse: 338
Additional binoculars produced: 591

Total binoculars = Initial binoculars + Additional binoculars
Total binoculars = 338 + 591 = &lt;&lt;338+591=929&gt;&gt;929

Therefore, the manufacturer has a total of 929 pairs of binoculars.

* Initially, the manufacturer had 338 pairs of binoculars in the warehouse.
* He produced an additional 591 pairs of binoculars.
* He sold 245 pairs of the newly made binoculars.

To find the number of binoculars the manufacturer has left, we need to:
1. Add the initial number of binoculars to the number of newly produced binoculars.
2. Subtract the number of sold binoculars from the total.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of binoculars before the sale.
Total binoculars before sale = Initial binoculars + Additional binoculars
Total binoculars before sale = 338 + 591 = &lt;&lt;338+591=929&gt;&gt;929

Step 2: Calculate the number of binoculars left after the sale.
Binoculars left = Total binoculars before sale - Sold binoculars
Binoculars left = 929 - 245 = &lt;&lt;929-245=684&gt;&gt;684

To calculate the total amount of money John has now, we need to add the money he found to his initial bank account balance.

Money in bank account = $663
Money found on the street = $37

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the total number of pages the reader has to read to finish both books.

Given:
- The first novel has 554 pages, and the reader has already read 228 pages.
- The second book contains 195 pages.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages left to read in the first novel.
Pages left in the first novel = Total pages in the first novel - Pages already read
Pages left in the first novel = 554 - 228 = 326

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pages the reader has to read to finish both books.
Total pages to read = Pages left in the first novel + Pages in the second book
Total pages to read = 326 + 195 = 521

Therefore, the reader has to read a total of 521 pages to finish both books.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given:
- The book has 857 pages in total.
- The reader has already read 228 pages.

To find the number of pages left for the reader to read, we subtract the number of pages already read from the total number of pages in the book.

857 - 228 = 629

So, the reader has 629 pages left to read in the book.

To find the total amount of paint used, we need to add the liters of red paint and blue paint together.

Total paint used = Red paint + Blue paint
Total paint used = 48 liters + 330 liters
Total paint used = &lt;&lt;48+330=378&gt;&gt;378 liters

Therefore, the painter has used a total of 378 liters of paint for his mural.

To find the total amount of paint used, we need to add the liters of red paint, blue paint, and yellow paint together.

Total paint used = Red paint + Blue paint + Yellow paint
Total paint used = 48 liters + 330 liters + 498 liters
Total paint used = &lt;&lt;48+330+498=876&gt;&gt;876 liters

Therefore, with the addition of yellow paint, the painter has used a total of 876 liters of paint for the mural.

* Originally, there were 584 pillows in your bedroom.
* Due to cleaning, 403 pillows were removed.

To find out how many pillows are left, we need to subtract the number of removed pillows from the original number of pillows.

Pillows left = Original number of pillows - Removed pillows
Pillows left = 584 - 403
Pillows left = &lt;&lt;584-403=181&gt;&gt;181

Therefore, after the cleaning process, there are 181 pillows left in your bedroom.

To find the total number of pillows in your bedroom now, we need to add the number of pillows you added to the number of pillows that were already in the room after cleaning.

Total pillows now = Pillows left after cleaning + Pillows added
Total pillows now = 181 + 348
Total pillows now = &lt;&lt;181+348=529&gt;&gt;529

To find out how many pearls are left, we need to subtract the number of pearls she gives away from the total number of pearls she had initially:

Pearls left = Initial number of pearls - Pearls given away
Pearls left = 306 - 211

Given:
- The store originally had 324 basic models of tents and 465 advanced models.
- The store sold 546 tents during the summer sale.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tents the store had before the summer sale.
Total tents before sale = Basic models + Advanced models
Total tents before sale = 324 + 465 = 789

Step 2: Subtract the number of tents sold during the summer sale from the total number of tents before the sale.
Tents left in the store = Total tents before sale - Tents sold during summer sale
Tents left in the store = 789 - 546 = 243

408 - 327 = 81

However, we need to consider if this scenario is possible. If there were only 408 mice in the lab initially, and 327 mice were released, the number of mice left in the lab would be 81. This is possible because 81 is a positive number, and there are enough mice in the lab to release 327 of them.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's use the information from the previous question and the new information provided.

Given:
* There were 713 astronauts in space after the last mission.
* 143 astronauts have now returned to Earth.

To find out how many astronauts are still in space, we need to subtract the number of astronauts who returned to Earth from the total number of astronauts after the last mission.

Astronauts after last mission - Astronauts who returned to Earth = Astronauts still in space
713 - 143 = &lt;&lt;713-143=570&gt;&gt;570

So, there are currently 570 astronauts still in space after 143 astronauts returned to Earth.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let me solve the problem with the correct information.

Given:
* Initially, there were 171 astronauts in space.
* A recent mission sent an additional 10 astronauts to join them.

To find the total number of astronauts in space after the recent mission, we need to add the initial number of astronauts to the number of astronauts who joined them.

Initial astronauts + Astronauts from the recent mission = Total astronauts in space
171 + 10 = &lt;&lt;171+10=181&gt;&gt;181

So, after the recent mission, there would be 181 astronauts in space.

* The farmer planted 746 carrot plants in the first field.
* The farmer planted an additional 91 carrot plants in the second field.

To find the total number of carrot plants the farmer planted, we need to add the number of plants in the first field and the second field.

Total carrot plants = Plants in the first field + Plants in the second field
Total carrot plants = 746 + 91
Total carrot plants = &lt;&lt;746+91=837&gt;&gt;837

Therefore, the farmer planted a total of 837 carrot plants.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the information from the previous question and the new information provided.

Given:
* The farmer planted 746 carrot plants in the first field.
* The farmer planted an additional 91 carrot plants in the second field.
* After a hailstorm, 83 plants did not survive.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of carrot plants the farmer planted initially.
Total carrot plants = Plants in the first field + Plants in the second field
Total carrot plants = 746 + 91 = &lt;&lt;746+91=837&gt;&gt;837

Step 2: Subtract the number of plants that did not survive from the total number of carrot plants.
Surviving carrot plants = Total carrot plants - Plants that did not survive
Surviving carrot plants = 837 - 83 = &lt;&lt;837-83=754&gt;&gt;754

Therefore, the farmer now has 754 carrot plants, avoiding the ones that did not survive.

        Following up on the previous question about the farmer losing some carrot plants to a hailstorm. Let's consider a scenario where the farmer had initially planted 737 carrot plants in the first field, instead of 746. If the same 91 carrot plants were planted in the second field, how many carrot plants would the farmer have in total then, before the hailstorm hit?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information based on the new scenario:
* The farmer planted 737 carrot plants in the first field (instead of 746).
* The farmer planted an additional 91 carrot plants in the second field (same as before).

To find the total number of carrot plants the farmer planted in this scenario, we need to add the number of plants in the first field and the second field.

Total carrot plants = Plants in the first field + Plants in the second field
Total carrot plants = 737 + 91
Total carrot plants = &lt;&lt;737+91=828&gt;&gt;828

Therefore, in this scenario, the farmer would have planted a total of 828 carrot plants before the hailstorm hit.

Given:
- There were 129 ballerinas practicing throughout the day.
- 791 more ballerinas arrived for a special workshop.

Step 1: Add the number of ballerinas who were practicing and the number of ballerinas who arrived for the special workshop.
Total ballerinas = Ballerinas practicing + Ballerinas arriving for the workshop
Total ballerinas = 129 + 791 = &lt;&lt;129+791=920&gt;&gt;920

Given:
- Jack had 23 building blocks left after building the castle.
- He found an old box containing 715 additional building blocks.

To find the total number of building blocks Jack has now, we need to add the remaining blocks and the newly found blocks:

Total blocks now = Remaining blocks + Newly found blocks
Total blocks now = 23 + 715
Total blocks now = &lt;&lt;23+715=738&gt;&gt;738

2. To find out how many building blocks Jack has left, we need to subtract the number of blocks he used from the updated total number of blocks he has:
   * Remaining blocks = Total blocks - Used blocks
   * Remaining blocks = 438 - 368

        In the previous scenario, the baby was receiving 658 milliliters of milk each day. But let's consider a different situation. Suppose that the baby was initially receiving 380 milliliters of milk each day. If the baby's pediatrician still advised to increase the milk intake by 18 milliliters, how much milk is the baby receiving daily in this new situation?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this new situation, let's organize the given information:
* The baby is initially receiving 380 milliliters of milk each day.
* The pediatrician advised to increase the milk intake by 18 milliliters.

Now, let's calculate the new amount of milk the baby is receiving:
* New milk intake = Initial milk intake + Increase in milk intake
* New milk intake = 380 milliliters + 18 milliliters
* New milk intake = &lt;&lt;380+18=398&gt;&gt;398 milliliters

Therefore, in this new situation, after the increase, the baby is receiving 398 milliliters of milk each day.

### Answer: 398 milliliters</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        A bus has a seating capacity of 399. If 29 seats are unavailable due to maintenance, how many seats are available for passengers?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The bus has a total seating capacity of 399.
* 29 seats are unavailable due to maintenance.

To find the number of available seats, we need to subtract the unavailable seats from the total seating capacity.

Available seats = Total seating capacity - Unavailable seats
Available seats = 399 - 29
Available seats = &lt;&lt;399-29=370&gt;&gt;370

Therefore, 370 seats are available for passengers.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Suppose that instead of a bus with 399 seats, the bus service rerouted a bigger bus with 747 seats for maintenance. If the same number of 29 seats were unavailable due to maintenance, how many seats would be available for passengers in the bigger bus?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same approach as before, but with the updated information.

Given:
* The bigger bus has a total seating capacity of 747.
* 29 seats are unavailable due to maintenance.

To find the number of available seats in the bigger bus, we need to subtract the unavailable seats from the total seating capacity.

Available seats in the bigger bus = Total seating capacity of the bigger bus - Unavailable seats
Available seats in the bigger bus = 747 - 29
Available seats in the bigger bus = &lt;&lt;747-29=718&gt;&gt;718

Therefore, 718 seats would be available for passengers in the bigger bus.
