        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jeff currently has a collection of 10 sunglasses.
   * He bought 4 of these sunglasses last summer.

2. To find out how many sunglasses Jeff had before last summer, we need to subtract the number of sunglasses he bought last summer from his current total.

3. Number of sunglasses before last summer = Current number of sunglasses - Number of sunglasses bought last summer
   * Number of sunglasses before last summer = 10 - 4
   * Number of sunglasses before last summer = 6

Therefore, Jeff had 6 sunglasses before last summer.

* The truck can carry a total weight of 10 tons.
* The truck is already carrying 5 tons of construction materials.

We need to find out how much additional weight the truck can carry.

Reasoning:
1. The truck's total capacity is 10 tons.
2. The truck is already carrying 5 tons.
3. To find the additional weight the truck can carry, we need to subtract the current load from the total capacity:
   * Additional weight = Total capacity - Current load
   * Additional weight = 10 tons - 5 tons
   * Additional weight = 5 tons

Therefore, the truck can carry an additional weight of 5 tons.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. The telescope has 10 main parts in total.
2. Out of these 10 parts, 2 are the lens and the eyepiece.
3. To find the number of other parts, we need to subtract the number of lens and eyepiece parts from the total number of parts.

Number of other parts = Total parts - (Lens parts + Eyepiece parts)
Number of other parts = 10 - (1 + 1)
Number of other parts = 10 - 2 = 8

Therefore, 8 other parts make up the telescope.

2) We can represent this information as an equation:

3) To find the value of x, we need to subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
   
   8 + x - 8 = 10 - 8
   
   x = 2

Therefore, the other number that when added to 8 results in 10 is 2.

3) Since the question doesn't mention any towers to the north or south, we can assume that all the remaining towers are to the west.

4) To find the number of towers to the west, we simply subtract the number of towers to the east from the total number of towers:

   Towers to the west = Total towers - Towers to the east
                      = 10 - 2

1. Understand the given information:
   * Sam has a total of 10 toy cars.
   * 7 of these toy cars are sports cars.

2. Determine the number of race cars:
   * Since Sam has only sports cars and race cars, we can find the number of race cars by subtracting the number of sports cars from the total number of toy cars.
   * Number of race cars = Total toy cars - Number of sports cars
   * Number of race cars = 10 - 7 = 3

Therefore, 3 of Sam's toy cars are race cars.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that there are a total of 10 fairies in the magical kingdom.
2. Out of these 10 fairies, 4 are water fairies.
3. The question does not provide any information about the number of fire fairies. It only asks about the number of fairies that are not water fairies.
4. To find the number of fairies that are not water fairies, we need to subtract the number of water fairies from the total number of fairies.

Number of non-water fairies = Total number of fairies - Number of water fairies
Number of non-water fairies = 10 - 4 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 fairies that are not water fairies. However, we cannot say for certain that all of these 6 fairies are fire fairies, as there might be other types of fairies in the kingdom.

Number of rainbow dusts = 10 - 5 = 5

Therefore, if 5 of the magical items were crystals, the remaining 5 items were rainbow dusts.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Daisy arranged a total of 10 shapes in a line.
   * She used 5 circles first in the line.

2. Calculate the number of remaining shapes:
   * Remaining shapes = Total shapes - Circles used
   * Remaining shapes = 10 - 5

* The rocket ship needs a total of 10 kilograms of fuel to launch.
* 7 kilograms of fuel are already filled in the rocket ship.

Now, to find out how many more kilograms of fuel are needed, we can subtract the amount of fuel already filled from the total amount of fuel required:

Fuel needed = Total fuel required - Fuel already filled
Fuel needed = 10 kilograms - 7 kilograms
Fuel needed = 10 - 7 = 3 kilograms

Therefore, 3 more kilograms of fuel are needed to fulfill the requirement for the rocket ship to launch.

1. Understand the given information:
   * A dolphin can jump a total of 10 feet in one leap.
   * 9 feet of this distance is due to its tail thrust.

2. Identify the question:
   * What height does the dolphin cover with its body strength alone?

3. Calculate the height covered by the dolphin's body strength:
   * Total jump height = Height due to tail thrust + Height due to body strength
   * 10 feet = 9 feet + Height due to body strength
   * Height due to body strength = 10 feet - 9 feet
   * Height due to body strength = 1 foot

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 10 cows in total on the farm.
2. Out of these 10 cows, 9 are brown.
3. To find the number of black cows, we need to subtract the number of brown cows from the total number of cows.

Number of black cows = Total number of cows - Number of brown cows
Number of black cows = 10 - 9 = 1

Therefore, there is 1 black cow on the farm.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Susie has a total of 10 cartons of milk.
   * One of the cartons is almond milk.

2. To find the number of cartons of cow's milk, we need to subtract the number of cartons of almond milk from the total number of cartons:
   * Number of cartons of cow's milk = Total cartons - Cartons of almond milk
   * Number of cartons of cow's milk = 10 - 1
   * Number of cartons of cow's milk = 9

Therefore, Susie has 9 cartons of cow's milk.

* John can currently play 10 different piano songs.
* He recently learned 9 new songs.

To determine the number of songs he could play before learning the new ones, we need to subtract the number of new songs from the total number of songs he can play now.

Number of songs before learning new ones = Total songs now - Number of new songs learned

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The total hours of daylight in a day is 10 hours.
* The Sun was up for 8 hours.

We need to find out how many hours the sun was hidden behind the clouds.

If the total daylight hours is 10 and the Sun was up for 8 hours, then the remaining hours would be the time when the sun was hidden behind the clouds.

To calculate this, we can subtract the hours the Sun was up from the total daylight hours:
* Hours the sun was hidden = Total daylight hours - Hours the Sun was up
* Hours the sun was hidden = 10 hours - 8 hours
* Hours the sun was hidden = 2 hours

Therefore, the sun was hidden behind the clouds for 2 hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that Sophie has a total of 10 scoops of ice cream in her bowl.
2. Out of these 10 scoops, 3 are vanilla.
3. Since there are only two flavors mentioned (vanilla and chocolate), we can assume that the remaining scoops are chocolate.
4. To find the number of chocolate scoops, we need to subtract the number of vanilla scoops from the total number of scoops:
   * Number of chocolate scoops = Total scoops - Vanilla scoops
   * Number of chocolate scoops = 10 - 3 = &lt;&lt;10-3=7&gt;&gt;7

Therefore, Sophie has 7 scoops of chocolate ice cream in her bowl.

* The giraffe needs to eat 10 pounds of food in a day.
* The giraffe has already eaten 8 pounds of food.

Now, to find out how much more food the giraffe needs to eat, we should:
1. Subtract the amount of food already eaten from the daily consumption goal.

Calculation:
* Remaining food to eat = Daily consumption goal - Food already eaten
* Remaining food to eat = 10 pounds - 8 pounds
* Remaining food to eat = 2 pounds

Therefore, the giraffe needs to eat 2 more pounds of food to reach his daily consumption goal.

2. Out of these 10 pixies, 3 have blue wings.
3. The problem doesn't mention any other wing colors, so we can assume that the remaining pixies have green wings.
4. To find the number of pixies with green wings, we need to subtract the number of pixies with blue wings from the total number of pixies.

Number of pixies with green wings = Total number of pixies - Number of pixies with blue wings
Number of pixies with green wings = 10 - 3 = &lt;&lt;10-3=7&gt;&gt;7

Therefore, 7 pixies have green wings in the fairy kingdom.
