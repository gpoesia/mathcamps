        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Aliyah correctly guesses 11 letter games initially
* She then correctly guesses 7 more games
* After that, she loses 6 times

To find the total number of letter games Aliyah correctly guessed, we need to:
1. Add the number of games she guessed correctly in the first two rounds
2. The 6 games she lost do not affect the total number of correct guesses

Calculation:
* Correct guesses in the first round = 11
* Correct guesses in the second round = 7
* Total correct guesses = 11 + 7 = 18

Therefore, Aliyah correctly guessed a total of 18 letter games in the competition.

* The pilot started the day with 4 helicopters at his base.
* During the day, 13 more helicopters arrived.

To find the total number of helicopters the pilot has at his base, we need to add the number of helicopters he started with and the number of helicopters that arrived during the day.

Total helicopters = Helicopters at the start of the day + Helicopters that arrived during the day
Total helicopters = 4 + 13
Total helicopters = 17

Therefore, the pilot has a total of 17 helicopters at his base.

1. Initially, there were 18 strawberries on the farm.
2. A little bird came by and ate 2 strawberries.
3. To find the number of strawberries left, we need to subtract the number of strawberries eaten by the bird from the initial number of strawberries.

Strawberries left = Initial number of strawberries - Number of strawberries eaten
Strawberries left = 18 - 2 = &lt;&lt;18-2=16&gt;&gt;16

Given:
- After the little bird ate 2 strawberries, there were 16 strawberries left on the farm.
- The farmer planted 2 more strawberry plants.

To find the total number of strawberries on the farm now, we need to add the number of strawberries from the newly planted plants to the existing strawberries.

4. Assume that each newly planted strawberry plant has 1 strawberry.
5. Calculate the total number of strawberries on the farm:

Total strawberries = Existing strawberries + Strawberries from new plants
Total strawberries = 16 + (2 Ã— 1) = &lt;&lt;16+2=18&gt;&gt;18

Therefore, after planting 2 more strawberry plants, there are now 18 strawberries on the farm.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of toothbrushes Isabella bought for her family and friends.
Total toothbrushes for family and friends = 11 + 2 = &lt;&lt;11+2=13&gt;&gt;13

Step 2: Add the number of extra toothbrushes Isabella bought to the total from Step 1.
Total toothbrushes bought = Total toothbrushes for family and friends + Extra toothbrushes

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's continue from the previous problem:

1. Understand the new information:
   * Sara had 15 earrings left after donating 2 to charity.
   * She now decides to gift 12 more earrings to her best friend.

2. To find out how many earrings Sara has left after gifting 12 more, we need to subtract the number of earrings she gifted from the number of earrings she had after donating:
   * Earrings left = Number of earrings after donating - Number of earrings gifted
   * Earrings left = 15 - 12
   * Earrings left = 3

Therefore, after gifting 12 more earrings to her best friend, Sara has 3 earrings left in her collection.

Given:
- Mason initially had 1 banana.
- His friend gave him 11 bananas instead of 19.

Step 1: Add the number of bananas Mason had initially and the number of bananas his friend gave him.

Total bananas = Initial bananas + Bananas given by his friend
Total bananas = 1 + 11 = &lt;&lt;1+11=12&gt;&gt;12

Therefore, if Mason originally had 1 banana and his friend gave him 11 more, Mason would have 12 bananas in total.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* Initially, there were 9 monkey bars on the jungle gym.
* 5 additional bars were added to the jungle gym.

To find the total number of monkey bars after the addition, we need to add the initial number of bars to the number of bars added.

Initial number of bars: 9
Number of bars added: 5

Total number of bars = Initial number of bars + Number of bars added
Total number of bars = 9 + 5 = &lt;&lt;9+5=14&gt;&gt;14

Therefore, after the addition, there are 14 monkey bars on the jungle gym.

1. Understand the given information:

   * She loses 9 crayons at school.

2. To find out how many crayons Sarah has left, we need to subtract the number of crayons she lost from the number of crayons she had initially:
   * Crayons left = Initial number of crayons - Number of crayons lost

- Initially, there were 4 chickens in the coop.
- On the first day, the farmer added 5 more chickens to the coop, making a total of 9 chickens.
- On the next day, the farmer brought in another 8 chickens to the same coop.

Step 1: Determine the number of chickens in the coop at the beginning of the second day.
Chickens at the beginning of the second day = 9

Step 2: Add the number of chickens brought in on the second day to the existing number of chickens.
Total chickens = Chickens at the beginning of the second day + Chickens brought in on the second day
Total chickens = 9 + 8 = &lt;&lt;9+8=17&gt;&gt;17

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. Initially, the farmer had 9 cows in the field.
2. Now, we suppose he added 5 cows to the field instead of 4.
3. To find the total number of cows in the field in this new scenario, we need to add the initial number of cows and the updated number of cows added.

Total cows = Initial cows + Added cows
Total cows = 9 + 5
Total cows = &lt;&lt;9+5=14&gt;&gt;14

Therefore, if the farmer had added 5 cows to the field instead of 4, there would be 14 cows in the field.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Paul already has 1 foot of rope.
   * He adds an additional length of 11 feet.

2. To find the total length of rope Paul has now, we need to add the initial length of rope to the additional length:
   * Total length = Initial length + Additional length
   * Total length = 1 foot + 11 feet
   * Total length = 12 feet

Therefore, Paul now has a total of 12 feet of rope.

Given:
- Paul initially had 1 foot of rope.
- He added an additional length of 11 feet, making the total length 12 feet.
- Now, he finds an extra 5 feet of rope in his toolbox.

Step 1: Calculate the total length of rope Paul has after adding the extra 5 feet.
Total length = Previous total length + Extra length found
Total length = 12 feet + 5 feet
Total length = 17 feet

Therefore, after adding the extra 5 feet of rope from his toolbox to the rope he already had, Paul now has a total of 17 feet of rope.

Given:
- Paul initially has 3 feet of rope.
- He adds an additional length of 11 feet.

Step 1: Calculate the total length of rope by adding the initial length and the additional length.
Total length = Initial length + Additional length
Total length = 3 feet + 11 feet
Total length = 14 feet

Therefore, with the updated scenario, Paul now has a total of 14 feet of rope.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off in the previous problem.

Given:
- Initially, Catherine had 5 roses in her front garden.
- She then planted 8 more roses, making a total of 13 roses.
- Now, her little brother adds 4 more roses to the garden.

To find the total number of roses in the garden now, we need to add the number of roses Catherine's brother planted to the total number of roses after Catherine planted hers.

Total roses after Catherine planted + Roses planted by her brother = Total roses now
13 + 4 = &lt;&lt;13+4=17&gt;&gt;17

Therefore, there are now 17 roses in total in the garden.

1. Initially, Catherine had 3 roses in her front garden.
2. She then planted 8 more roses.
3. To find the total number of roses, we need to add the initial number of roses to the number of roses she planted.

Initial roses + Planted roses = Total roses
3 + 8 = &lt;&lt;3+8=11&gt;&gt;11

Therefore, if Catherine initially had 3 roses and then planted 8 more, she would have a total of 11 roses in her front garden.

Given:
- Stella's first box can fit a total of 20 dolls, and it already has 17 dolls in it.
- Stella found another box that can hold 15 more dolls.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining space in the first box.
Remaining space in the first box = Total capacity of the first box - Dolls already in the first box
Remaining space in the first box = 20 - 17 = 3

Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of both boxes.
Total capacity of both boxes = Total capacity of the first box + Total capacity of the second box
Total capacity of both boxes = 20 + 15 = 35

Step 3: Calculate the total number of dolls Stella can store in both boxes.
Total dolls Stella can store = Dolls already in the first box + Remaining space in the first box + Total capacity of the second box
Total dolls Stella can store = 17 + 3 + 15 = 35

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's update the problem with the new information:
* Sal traveled 9 inches in the morning (instead of 14 inches).
* Sal traveled 6 inches in the afternoon.

To find the total distance Sal traveled in one day, we need to add the updated distances traveled in the morning and afternoon.

Total distance = Morning distance + Afternoon distance
Total distance = 9 inches + 6 inches
Total distance = 9 + 6 = &lt;&lt;9+6=15&gt;&gt;15 inches

Therefore, with the updated morning distance, Sal traveled a total of 15 inches in one day.

1. Initially, the forest had 18 trees.
2. Later, 10 trees were cut down.
3. To find the number of trees left standing, we need to subtract the number of trees cut down from the initial number of trees.

Trees left standing = Initial number of trees - Trees cut down

   Trees left standing = 18 - 10 = 8

3. The forest team wants to have a total of 17 trees in the forest.
4. To find the number of trees they need to plant, we subtract the number of trees left standing from the desired total number of trees.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this new scenario using the same problem-solving steps.

Given:
- The forest originally had 18 trees.
- In this new scenario, only 4 trees were cut down.

Step 1: Determine the number of trees left standing by subtracting the number of trees cut down from the original number of trees.

Trees left standing = Original number of trees - Trees cut down
Trees left standing = 18 - 4 = 14

Therefore, if the forest originally had 18 trees and only 4 were cut down, there would be 14 trees left standing in the forest.

Number of clouds in the morning = 5
Number of clouds in the afternoon = 11

Total number of clouds = Number of clouds in the morning + Number of clouds in the afternoon

1. The clown starts by juggling 3 apples.

2. This time, he adds 9 more apples to his act instead of 16.
   * Number of apples after adding 9: 3 + 9 = 12

3. Then, he decides to add an extra apple for a challenge, just like before.
   * Number of apples after adding one more: 12 + 1 = 13

So, with this reset, the clown is now juggling 13 apples.

Given:
- The pirate had 9 gold coins in his chest after bribing his fellow pirate.
- He found 7 more gold coins during his treasure hunt.

To find the total number of coins the pirate has now, we need to add the coins he found to the coins he already had in his chest.

1. From the previous problem, we know that Max had already set up 8 tents (1 for himself and 7 for his friends).
2. Now, another group of 9 friends showed up unexpectedly.
3. Max assembled a tent for each of these 9 friends.

So, the total number of tents Max has set up now can be calculated as follows:
* Previously set up tents: 8
* Tents for the new group of 9 friends: 9 Ã— 1 = 9

Total tents = Previously set up tents + Tents for the new group
Total tents = 8 + 9 = &lt;&lt;8+9=17&gt;&gt;17

Given:
- Initially, there were 20 lights displayed, and all of them were thought to be significant.
- However, 12 of these lights were actually a distraction and not significant.

To find the number of real significant lights, we need to subtract the number of distracting lights from the initial total number of lights:

Real significant lights = Initial total lights - Distracting lights
Real significant lights = 20 - 12 = 8

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given:
* Daisy initially had 18 lemons.
* She used 2 lemons to make lemonade.

To find out how many lemons Daisy has left, we need to subtract the number of lemons she used from the number of lemons she initially had.

Lemons left = Initial number of lemons - Lemons used
Lemons left = 18 - 2 = 16

Therefore, if Daisy originally had 18 lemons and used 2 lemons to make lemonade, she would have 16 lemons left.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * William's robot can score 13 points in total.
   * Due to a technical malfunction, it scores 8 points less.
   * After fixing the issue, the robot scores an additional 5 points.

2. Calculate the points scored by the robot with the technical malfunction:
   * Points scored with malfunction = Total points - Points lost due to malfunction
   * Points scored with malfunction = 13 - 8 = 5 points

3. Calculate the total points scored by the robot after fixing the issue:
   * Total points after fixing = Points scored with malfunction + Additional points scored
   * Total points after fixing = 5 + 5 = 10 points

Therefore, William's robot's total score after fixing the technical issue is 10 points.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's analyze the problem:
* A standard deck of cards has 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades.
* The problem states that this deck has hearts and spades, which are 2 of the standard suits.
* In addition to hearts and spades, the deck has 1 special suit.

To find the total number of suits in the deck, we need to add the number of standard suits mentioned (hearts and spades) and the number of special suits.

Number of standard suits mentioned: 2 (hearts and spades)
Number of special suits: 1

Total number of suits = Number of standard suits mentioned + Number of special suits
Total number of suits = 2 + 1 = 3

1. Initially, there were 8 lions at the zoo.
2. 7 lions have been moved to a different zoo.
3. To find the new lion count, we subtract the number of lions moved from the initial number of lions:
   * New lion count = 8 - 7 = 1

4. The number of tigers at the zoo is the new lion count plus 10:
   * Number of tigers = New lion count + 10
   * Number of tigers = 1 + 10 = 11

Therefore, there are 11 tigers at the zoo.

2. 7 lions have been moved to a different zoo.
3. To find the new lion count, we subtract the number of lions moved from the initial number of lions:

4. In this modified situation, there are 15 tigers at the zoo, and this number accounts for the lions that were moved.

2. He has to pay a tax of 4 gold coins to the king of the game.

3. To find the remaining gold coins, we need to subtract the tax from Max's current total.
   * Current total coins = 19
   * Tax to be paid = 4
   * Remaining coins = Current total coins - Tax to be paid

Given:
- Initially, Max had 11 gold coins in his treasure chest.
- After finding the additional coins, Max's total is 9 coins more than he had initially.

Step 1: Determine the number of additional coins Max found.
Additional coins = Total coins - Initial coins
Additional coins = 9

Step 2: Calculate the total number of coins Max has after finding the additional coins.
Total coins = Initial coins + Additional coins
Total coins = 11 + 9 = 20

Therefore, if Max initially had 11 gold coins in his treasure chest, he would have 20 gold coins after finding the additional set of coins.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given:
- Captain Jack initially had 14 parrots.
- He found 6 more parrots and added them to his crew.

To find the total number of parrots, we need to add the initial number of parrots to the number of parrots he found.

Initial parrots + Found parrots = Total parrots
14 + 6 = &lt;&lt;14+6=20&gt;&gt;20

Therefore, if Captain Jack initially had 14 parrots and found 6 more, he would have a total of 20 parrots in his crew.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Liam starts with 8 piano keys.
   * He adds 3 more piano keys later in the day.

2. To find the total number of piano keys Liam has now, we need to add the number of keys he started with and the number of keys he added later:
   * Total piano keys = Initial number of keys + Added keys

2. From the previous problem, we know that Liam had 11 piano keys after adding 3 keys to his initial 8 keys.

3. Now, to find the total number of piano keys Liam has after adding 5 more keys, we need to add the number of keys he had before and the number of keys he added:
   * Total piano keys = Previous number of keys + Newly added keys

Now, let's find out how many tasks the doctor still has left to complete:

Step 1: Determine the number of tasks the doctor completed.
Completed tasks = Number of patients treated = 14

Step 2: Calculate the remaining tasks by subtracting the completed tasks from the initial number of tasks.
Remaining tasks = Initial tasks - Completed tasks

1. The album has a total of 15 songs.
2. Sam has already listened to 9 songs.
3. To find the number of songs Sam has not listened to yet, we need to subtract the number of songs he has listened to from the total number of songs on the album.

Calculation:
* Total songs - Songs listened to = Songs not listened to yet
* 15 - 9 = 6

Therefore, Sam has not listened to 6 songs on the album yet.

1. Sam has not listened to 6 songs on the album.
2. Alex shared 3 additional new songs with Sam.

To find the total number of songs Sam has not listened to yet, we need to add the number of unlistened songs from the album and the new songs shared by Alex.

Calculation:
* Unlistened songs from the album + New songs shared by Alex = Total unlistened songs

Therefore, Sam has not listened to a total of 9 songs yet, including the songs from the album and the new songs shared by Alex.

* The album has a total of 15 songs.
* In this new scenario, Sam has already listened to 13 songs.
* We need to find out how many songs Sam has not listened to.

To solve this problem, we can use the same approach as before:

1. Calculate the number of songs Sam has not listened to by subtracting the number of songs he has listened to from the total number of songs on the album.

Calculation:
* Total songs - Songs listened to = Songs not listened to
* 15 - 13 = 2

Therefore, if Sam had originally listened to 13 songs from the album, he would have 2 songs left that he has not listened to.

Remaining orbs = 20 - 2

* There are 3 small trees in the park.
* There are 6 medium trees in the park.
* 9 additional big trees will be planted.

To find the total number of trees after planting the additional trees, we need to:
1. Find the current total number of trees by adding the number of small and medium trees.
2. Add the number of additional big trees to the current total.

Step 1: Current total number of trees
* Current total = Number of small trees + Number of medium trees
* Current total = 3 + 6 = 9

Step 2: Total number of trees after planting the additional trees
* Total after planting = Current total + Number of additional big trees

2. To find the number of firefighters still on their way, we need to subtract the number of firefighters at the site from the total number of firefighters:
   * Firefighters on their way = Total firefighters - Firefighters at the site
   * Firefighters on their way = 9 - 6
   * Firefighters on their way = 3

Therefore, 3 firefighters are still on their way to the site.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's continue from the previous problem:

1. Understand the new information:
   * 3 firefighters were already on their way from the original team.
   * 5 additional firefighters from another station have been dispatched.

2. To find the total number of firefighters on their way now, we need to add the number of firefighters from the original team who were on their way and the additional firefighters dispatched from another station:
   * Total firefighters on their way = Original team firefighters on their way + Additional firefighters dispatched
   * Total firefighters on their way = 3 + 5
   * Total firefighters on their way = 8

So, with the additional dispatch, there are now 8 firefighters on their way to the fire site.

Given:
- The team now has a total of 11 firefighters.
- 6 firefighters have already reached the site.

To find the number of firefighters still on their way, we subtract the number of firefighters at the site from the total number of firefighters:

Firefighters on their way = Total firefighters - Firefighters at the site
Firefighters on their way = 11 - 6
Firefighters on their way = 5

Therefore, if the team initially consisted of 11 firefighters and 6 managed to get to the site immediately, 5 firefighters would still be on their way.

To find the total number of times Carter wants to swing, we need to add the number of times he swings on the blue swing and the red swing.

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 5 rooms on the ground floor.
   * The total number of rooms in the house is 18.

2. To find the number of rooms above the ground floor, we need to subtract the number of rooms on the ground floor from the total number of rooms in the house.

3. Number of rooms above the ground floor = Total number of rooms - Number of rooms on the ground floor

- There are 5 rooms on the ground floor.
- The total number of rooms in the house is 18.
- The basement is counted as a room.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rooms above the ground floor.
Rooms above the ground floor = Total rooms - Ground floor rooms - Basement
Rooms above the ground floor = 18 - 5 - 1 = 12

Step 2: Calculate the total number of rooms above the ground floor or in the basement.
Rooms above the ground floor or in the basement = Rooms above the ground floor + Basement
Rooms above the ground floor or in the basement = 12 + 1 = 13

Therefore, there are 13 rooms in the house that are either above the ground floor or in the basement.

Given:
- Tina had 9 apples in total.
- She ate 8 apples.

Step 1: To find the number of apples Tina has left, we need to subtract the number of apples she ate from the total number of apples she had.
Apples left = Total apples - Apples eaten
Apples left = 9 - 8
Apples left = 1

Therefore, Tina has 1 apple left after eating 8 apples.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the new information.

Given:
- Tina already has 1 apple.
- She finds 6 more apples under the apple tree (instead of 8).

Step 1: Add the number of apples Tina already has to the number of apples she found under the tree.
Total apples = Apples Tina already has + Apples she found under the tree
Total apples = 1 + 6
Total apples = 7

Therefore, if Tina found 6 more apples under the apple tree, she would have a total of 7 apples.

Given:
- The shop opens at 13:00 (1:00 PM).
- It is supposed to stay open for 5 hours.
- The shop usually closes one hour before the time it is supposed to.

Step 1: Determine the time the shop is supposed to close.
Supposed closing time = Opening time + Hours open
Supposed closing time = 13:00 + 5 hours = 18:00 (6:00 PM)

Step 2: Calculate the actual closing time by subtracting one hour from the supposed closing time.
Actual closing time = Supposed closing time - 1 hour
Actual closing time = 18:00 - 1 hour = 17:00 (5:00 PM)

Therefore, the shop will actually close at 17:00 (5:00 PM).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Gary initially has 16 pairs of pants in his wardrobe.
   * He buys one new pair of pants during his shopping trip.

2. To find the total number of pairs of pants Gary has now, we need to add the new pair to his existing collection:
   * Total pairs of pants = Initial pairs of pants + New pair of pants
   * Total pairs of pants = 16 + 1
   * Total pairs of pants = 17

Therefore, after buying a new pair of pants, Gary now has 17 pairs of pants in his wardrobe.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Janet initially has 8 crayons.
2. She gives 3 crayons to her friend, Anna.
3. To find out how many crayons Janet has left, we need to subtract the number of crayons she gave away from the total number of crayons she had initially.

So, the number of crayons Janet has left = Initial number of crayons - Number of crayons given away
* Initial number of crayons = 8
* Number of crayons given away = 3
* Number of crayons left = 8 - 3 = 5

Therefore, Janet has 5 crayons left now.

Given:
- Janet had 8 crayons initially.
- She gave 3 crayons to her friend, Anna.
- After giving the crayons to Anna, Janet found 2 more crayons in her bag.

Step 1: Calculate the number of crayons Janet had after giving some to Anna.
Crayons left after giving to Anna = Initial number of crayons - Number of crayons given away
Crayons left after giving to Anna = 8 - 3 = 5

Step 2: Calculate the total number of crayons Janet has now by adding the crayons she found in her bag to the crayons she had left after giving some to Anna.
Total crayons Janet has now = Crayons left after giving to Anna + Crayons found in her bag
Total crayons Janet has now = 5 + 2 = 7

Therefore, Janet now has a total of 7 crayons.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given:
- Janet initially has 14 crayons.
- She gives 3 crayons to her friend, Anna.

To find out how many crayons Janet has left, we need to subtract the number of crayons she gave away from the total number of crayons she had initially.

Number of crayons Janet has left = Initial number of crayons - Number of crayons given away
* Initial number of crayons = 14
* Number of crayons given away = 3
* Number of crayons left = 14 - 3 = 11

Therefore, if Janet initially had 14 crayons and gave 3 to her friend Anna, she would have 11 crayons left.

We already know that the rabbit had found a total of 6 carrots in the backyard and front yard. Now, we need to add the carrot found in the neighbor's yard to the total.

Updated total carrots = Previous total carrots + Carrots in the neighbor's yard
Updated total carrots = 6 + 1 = 7

Therefore, after finding one more carrot in the neighbor's yard, the rabbit has now found a total of 7 carrots.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given:
* Melissa has 5 blankets in her living room.
* She finds 9 blankets in her wardrobe (instead of 14).

To find the total number of blankets Melissa has, we need to add the number of blankets in the living room and the number of blankets found in the wardrobe.

Total blankets = Blankets in the living room + Blankets in the wardrobe
Total blankets = 5 + 9
Total blankets = &lt;&lt;5+9=14&gt;&gt;14

Therefore, if Melissa had 9 blankets in her wardrobe instead of 14, she would have a total of 14 blankets.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the geometry box initially contains 18 shapes.
2. The question states that one shape is removed from the box.
3. To find how many shapes are left, we need to subtract the removed shape from the total number of shapes.

Calculation:
* Initial number of shapes = 18
* Number of shapes removed = 1
* Remaining shapes = Initial number of shapes - Number of shapes removed
* Remaining shapes = 18 - 1 = 17

Therefore, after removing one shape from the geometry box, there are 17 shapes left in the box.

1. After removing one shape, there were 17 shapes left in the geometry box.
2. Now, Arya decides to remove 8 more shapes from the box.
3. To find how many shapes are left after removing the additional 8 shapes, we need to subtract 8 from the remaining number of shapes.

Calculation:
* Remaining shapes after removing one shape = 17
* Additional shapes removed by Arya = 8
* Final number of shapes = Remaining shapes after removing one shape - Additional shapes removed by Arya
* Final number of shapes = 17 - 8 = 9

Therefore, after Arya removes 8 more shapes from the geometry box, there will be 9 shapes left in the box.
