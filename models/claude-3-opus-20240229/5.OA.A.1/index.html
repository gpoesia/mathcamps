            A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Find the number of additional packs that can be made from the remaining socks:
   * Total socks to package = 2840
   * Socks per pack = 40
   * Additional packs = 2840 Ã· 40 = 71

2. Calculate the total number of packs after packaging all the socks:
   * Packs already made = 93
   * Total packs = Additional packs + Packs already made
   * Total packs = 71 + 93 = 164

3. Account for the additional shipment and returned packs:
   * Packs received in the new shipment = 70
   * Packs returned due to quality issues = 8
   * Final number of packs = Total packs + Packs received - Packs returned
   * Final number of packs = 164 + 70 - 8 = 226

1. Find the total number of roses produced:
   * Number of rose bushes = 80
   * Roses produced by each bush = 30

2. Find the number of roses remaining after the storm:

2. Find the number of roses remaining after the storm:
   * Roses blown away by the storm = 43

2. Find the total number of feet the dolphin has jumped:
   * The dolphin completes 89 jumps in a day.
   * Each jump is 62 feet high.

   * Each jump is now 100 feet high.
   * Total feet jumped = Number of jumps Ã— Height of each jump

Given:
- The store starts the day with 81 pieces of candy.
- They receive a delivery of 6 more candies.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of candies after the delivery.
Total candies after delivery = Initial candies + Delivered candies
Total candies after delivery = 81 + 6 = 87 candies

Step 2: Calculate the remaining candies after selling 7 candies.
Remaining candies = Total candies after delivery - Sold candies
Remaining candies = 87 - 7 = 80 candies

Given:
- The sports store received 6806 pairs of ice skates.
- The skates will now be evenly distributed over 61 stores instead of 82.

Step 1: Divide the total number of ice skates by the new number of stores.
6806 Ã· 61 = 111 remainder 35

This means that each store will receive 111 pairs of ice skates, and there will be 35 pairs of ice skates left over.

Step 2: Distribute the remaining 35 pairs of ice skates.
Since there are 35 pairs of ice skates left over, we can add one extra pair to 35 of the 61 stores.

Therefore, 35 stores will receive 112 pairs of ice skates each, and the remaining 26 stores will receive 111 pairs each.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step with the new information.

Given:
- In the original scenario, a grape vine produces 3344 grapes.
- The farmer had 38 equally productive grape vines.
- In the new situation, the farmer has 75 equally productive vines.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of grapes produced by all the vines in the original scenario.
Total grapes = Number of grapes per vine Ã— Number of vines
Total grapes = 3344 Ã— 38 = 127,072

Step 2: In the new situation, the total number of grapes remains the same, but the number of vines has changed. To find the number of grapes each vine would produce, divide the total number of grapes by the new number of vines.
Grapes per vine in the new situation = Total grapes Ã· New number of vines
Grapes per vine in the new situation = 127,072 Ã· 75 = 1,694.29333...

Since we can't have a fraction of a grape, we round down to the nearest whole number.

1. Add the amount of snow from yesterday and today.
2. Subtract the amount of snow that has melted.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of snowfall
* Total snowfall = Yesterday's snowfall + Today's snowfall

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of snowfall
* Total snowfall = Yesterday's snowfall + Today's snowfall
* Total snowfall = 93 cm + 90 cm = 183 cm

Step 2: Subtract the amount of snow that has melted
* Remaining snow = Total snowfall - Melted snow

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* The giraffe needs 67 leaves for breakfast.
* The giraffe needs 33 more leaves in the afternoon.

To find the total number of leaves the giraffe needs for a single day, we need to add the number of leaves needed for breakfast and the number of leaves needed in the afternoon.

Total leaves needed = Leaves needed for breakfast + Leaves needed in the afternoon
Total leaves needed = 67 + 33 = &lt;&lt;67+33=100&gt;&gt;100

Therefore, the giraffe needs 100 leaves for a single day.

Given:
- You can drive 304 miles on a full tank of gas.
- The tank is divided into 4 equal parts.
- From the previous question, we found that you can drive 76 miles on one part of the tank.

- The piece of debris got an additional 94 miles downstream due to the wind in those 31 days.

To find the total distance the piece of debris would have traveled, we need to add the distance traveled by the river and the additional distance the debris moved due to the wind.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance the piece of debris traveled.
Total distance = Distance traveled by the river + Additional distance due to the wind

1. Find the total number of lemons the tree produced in 40 years:
   * The tree produces 99 lemons every year
   * In 40 years, the tree produced: 99 Ã— 40 = 3,960 lemons

2. Subtract the number of lemons removed by the wind storm:
   * The wind storm removed 84 lemons

To find the average number of seashells per meter, we need to divide the total number of seashells by the total number of meters.

Average seashells per meter = Total number of seashells Ã· Total number of meters
Average seashells per meter = 5544 Ã· 72

To find the new average number of seashells per meter, we need to divide the total number of seashells by the updated total number of meters.

New average seashells per meter = Total number of seashells Ã· Updated total number of meters
New average seashells per meter = 5544 Ã· 92
New average seashells per meter = &lt;&lt;5544/92=60.26086956521739&gt;&gt;60.26086956521739

Since we can't have a fraction of a seashell, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Rounded average seashells per meter = &lt;&lt;round(60.26086956521739)=60&gt;&gt;60

Given:
* The factory's new goal is to produce 50 windows within a month.

* Daily production = 1.6129...

However, since we can't produce a fraction of a window, we'll round up the daily production to the nearest whole number:

Step 1: Determine the number of leaps needed by dividing the total distance by the average distance per leap.
Number of leaps = Total distance Ã· Average distance per leap
Number of leaps = 83 inches Ã· 6 inches

Step 2: Perform the division.
Number of leaps = 83 Ã· 6 = 13.833...

Step 3: Since the frog can only make whole leaps, we need to round up the result to the nearest whole number.

            Continuing with the scenario of the cheese factory, let's say the factory now operates 31 days a month rather than 85 days, with the overall cheese production still being 5865 kg. How much cheese would now be produced each day?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the same total cheese production but change the number of days to find the new daily cheese production.

Given:
- The cheese factory produces 5865 kg of cheese in total.
- The production is now spread evenly over 31 days in a month.

To calculate the new daily cheese production, we divide the total amount by the new number of days:

New daily cheese production = Total cheese production Ã· New number of days
New daily cheese production = 5865 kg Ã· 31 days
New daily cheese production = 189.19... kg/day

We can round this value to the nearest whole number for practicality:
New daily cheese production â‰ˆ 189 kg/day

Therefore, with the factory operating 31 days a month, it would now produce approximately 189 kg of cheese each day.

1. Find the number of cucumbers yielded per plant:
   * The farm yields 2592 cucumbers per 54 plants.
   * Cucumbers per plant = 2592 Ã· 54 = &lt;&lt;2592/54=48&gt;&gt;48

2. Calculate the number of cucumbers grown by 38 plants:
   * Cucumbers grown by 38 plants = 38 Ã— 48 = &lt;&lt;38*48=1824&gt;&gt;1824

3. Subtract the damaged cucumbers from the total:

- The section of the farm grows 38 plants.
- Only 1 cucumber is damaged in this section.

Step 1: Find the number of cucumbers yielded per plant (same as before):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. The battery lasts 16 hours without the lights on.
2. When the lights are on, the battery life decreases by 36 Ã· 9 hours.
   36 Ã· 9 = &lt;&lt;36/9=4&gt;&gt;4 hours

3. So, with the lights on, the battery life is:
   16 - 4 = &lt;&lt;16-4=12&gt;&gt;12 hours

4. The toy car is run with the lights on for 12 full weeks.
   Each week is considered to be 60 hours.
   Total hours with lights on = 12 Ã— 60 = &lt;&lt;12*60=720&gt;&gt;720 hours

5. Number of battery cycles (recharges) needed:
   720 hours Ã· 12 hours per cycle = &lt;&lt;720/12=60&gt;&gt;60 cycles

Given:
- The bear eats 2726 ounces of salmon in total.
- The bear feasts for 58 days during the summer period.

Step 1: Divide the total amount of salmon by the number of days.
Average daily salmon consumption = Total salmon consumed Ã· Number of days
Average daily salmon consumption = 2726 Ã· 58 = 47 ounces per day

Given:

Step 1: Divide the total amount of salmon by the new number of days.
Average daily salmon consumption = Total salmon consumed Ã· Number of days
Average daily salmon consumption = 2726 Ã· 50 = 54.52 ounces per day

Since we can't have a fractional amount of ounces, we round 54.52 to the nearest whole number, which is 55 ounces per day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The chef now uses 65 grams of sugar to make 7 cakes.
   * We need to find out how much sugar she uses for each cake in this new batch.

2. To find the amount of sugar used for each cake, we need to divide the total amount of sugar by the number of cakes:
   * Sugar per cake = Total sugar Ã· Number of cakes
   * Sugar per cake = 65 grams Ã· 7

3. Perform the division:
   * 65 Ã· 7 = 9 remainder 2
   * 9 remainder 2 can be written as a mixed fraction: 9 2/7

4. Convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction:
   * 9 2/7 = (9 Ã— 7 + 2) Ã· 7
   * 9 2/7 = 65 Ã· 7

5. Simplify the fraction:
   * 65 Ã· 7 cannot be simplified further, so the final answer is 65/7 grams.

Therefore, the chef now uses 65/7 grams (approximately 9.29 grams) of sugar for each cake in the new batch.

            A kite maker has 41 blue, 63 red, and 57 green kites. If they give away 98 kites and create an additional 3 kites, how many kites does the maker have now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* The kite maker has 41 blue kites, 63 red kites, and 57 green kites.
* The kite maker gives away 98 kites.
* The kite maker creates an additional 3 kites.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Find the total number of kites the maker had initially:
   * Total kites = Blue kites + Red kites + Green kites
   * Total kites = 41 + 63 + 57 = &lt;&lt;41+63+57=161&gt;&gt;161 kites

2. Subtract the number of kites given away:
   * Remaining kites = Total kites - Kites given away
   * Remaining kites = 161 - 98 = &lt;&lt;161-98=63&gt;&gt;63 kites

3. Add the number of additional kites created:
   * Final number of kites = Remaining kites + Additional kites created
   * Final number of kites = 63 + 3 = &lt;&lt;63+3=66&gt;&gt;66 kites

Therefore, the kite maker now has 66 kites.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the final number of kites from the previous problem and follow the new instructions.

Given:
- The kite maker currently has 66 kites (from the previous problem).
- The kite maker multiplies their current inventory by 18.
- The kite maker then adds the original inventory (41 blue, 63 red, and 57 green kites) to the increased production.

Step 1: Calculate the number of kites after multiplying the current inventory by 18.
Kites after increased production = Current inventory Ã— 18
Kites after increased production = 66 Ã— 18 = &lt;&lt;66*18=1188&gt;&gt;1,188 kites

Step 2: Calculate the total number of kites in the original inventory.
Original inventory = Blue kites + Red kites + Green kites
Original inventory = 41 + 63 + 57 = &lt;&lt;41+63+57=161&gt;&gt;161 kites

Step 3: Add the original inventory to the increased production.
Total kites = Kites after increased production + Original inventory
Total kites = 1,188 + 161 = &lt;&lt;1188+161=1349&gt;&gt;1,349 kites

Therefore, the kite maker would now have 1,349 kites.

            After the kite maker gave away some kites and made new ones, let's change the circumstances a bit. Instead of giving away 98 kites, they only gave away 19 kites. Taking into account that they still made an additional 3 kites, how many kites does the maker have now?

* The kite maker has 41 blue kites, 63 red kites, and 57 green kites.
* The kite maker gives away 19 kites (instead of 98).
* The kite maker creates an additional 3 kites.

Let's solve the problem again with the updated information:

1. Find the total number of kites the maker had initially (this remains the same):
   * Total kites = Blue kites + Red kites + Green kites
   * Total kites = 41 + 63 + 57 = 161 kites

2. Subtract the updated number of kites given away:
   * Remaining kites = Total kites - Kites given away
   * Remaining kites = 161 - 19 = &lt;&lt;161-19=142&gt;&gt;142 kites

3. Add the number of additional kites created:
   * Final number of kites = Remaining kites + Additional kites created
   * Final number of kites = 142 + 3 = &lt;&lt;142+3=145&gt;&gt;145 kites

With the updated information, the kite maker now has 145 kites.

Given:

Step 1: Calculate the distance the train would have traveled at the original speed.
Original distance = Original speed Ã— Travel time
Original distance = 68 mph Ã— 21 hours = 1,428 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance the train traveled at the reduced speed.
Reduced distance = Reduced speed Ã— Travel time
Reduced distance = 28 mph Ã— 21 hours = 588 miles

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the original distance and the reduced distance.
Impact on total distance = Original distance - Reduced distance
Impact on total distance = 1,428 miles - 588 miles = 840 miles

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information and solve the problem step by step:

* The designer creates 77 dresses in a week.
* Each dress is sold for $16.
* The cost of fabric damage is $27.

To find out how much the designer earned after accounting for the fabric damage, we need to:
1. Calculate the total amount earned from selling the dresses.
2. Subtract the cost of fabric damage from the total amount.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount earned from selling the dresses
* Total amount = Number of dresses Ã— Price per dress
* Total amount = 77 Ã— $16
* Total amount = $1,232

Step 2: Subtract the cost of fabric damage from the total amount
* Earnings after fabric damage = Total amount - Cost of fabric damage
* Earnings after fabric damage = $1,232 - $27
* Earnings after fabric damage = $1,205

Therefore, the designer earned $1,205 after accounting for the fabric damage.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. To find out how far the snail travels in a day with the additional energy, we need to calculate the extra distance the snail can travel using the energy from the lettuce leaves.

Given:
- The snail travels 66 inches in a day without the additional energy.
- The snail extracted energy from 704 lettuce leaves over 22 days.
- The additional energy allows the snail to move an extra inch per day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of extra inches the snail can travel per day using the energy from the lettuce leaves.
Extra inches per day = Total lettuce leaves Ã· Number of days
Extra inches per day = 704 Ã· 22 = 32 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total distance the snail travels in a day with the additional energy.
Total distance per day = Regular daily distance + Extra inches per day
Total distance per day = 66 inches + 32 inches = 98 inches

Therefore, with the additional energy from the lettuce leaves, the snail can travel 98 inches in a day.

            After some days, the snail found a new source of energy and added another benefit: it ate 330 beet leaves over 33 days, which allowed it to move an additional inch per day. With the added energy from the beet leaves, how far does the snail now travel in a day?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Excellent! Let's solve this problem step by step. We will use the information from the previous question and add the new energy source from the beet leaves to calculate the total distance the snail can travel in a day.

Given:
- The snail travels 66 inches in a day without any additional energy.
- The snail extracted energy from 704 lettuce leaves over 22 days, allowing it to move an additional 32 inches per day.
- The snail now has a new energy source from 330 beet leaves eaten over 33 days, allowing it to move an additional inch per day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of extra inches the snail can travel per day using the energy from the beet leaves.
Extra inches per day from beet leaves = Total beet leaves Ã· Number of days
Extra inches per day from beet leaves = 330 Ã· 33 = 10 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total extra inches the snail can travel per day using the energy from both lettuce and beet leaves.
Total extra inches per day = Extra inches from lettuce leaves + Extra inches from beet leaves
Total extra inches per day = 32 inches + 10 inches = 42 inches

Step 3: Calculate the total distance the snail travels in a day with the additional energy from both sources.
Total distance per day = Regular daily distance + Total extra inches per day
Total distance per day = 66 inches + 42 inches = 108 inches

Therefore, with the added energy from both the lettuce and beet leaves, the snail can now travel 108 inches in a day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Alright, let's solve this problem with the updated information. We will calculate the total distance the snail travels in a day, considering the corrected regular daily distance and the additional energy from the lettuce leaves.

Given:
- The snail actually travels 25 inches in a day without the additional energy (instead of 66 inches).
- The snail extracted energy from 704 lettuce leaves over 22 days.
- The additional energy allows the snail to move an extra inch per day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of extra inches the snail can travel per day using the energy from the lettuce leaves (this remains the same as in the previous problem).
Extra inches per day = Total lettuce leaves Ã· Number of days
Extra inches per day = 704 Ã· 22 = 32 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total distance the snail travels in a day with the additional energy, using the corrected regular daily distance.
Total distance per day = Corrected regular daily distance + Extra inches per day
Total distance per day = 25 inches + 32 inches = 57 inches

Therefore, with the corrected regular daily distance and the additional energy from the lettuce leaves, the snail now travels 57 inches in a day.

1. We know that the monkey gets 360 bananas over 12 months, plus an extra 16 bananas per month.

2. First, let's calculate how many bananas the monkey gets per month from the 360 bananas:
   360 bananas Ã· 12 months = 30 bananas per month

3. Now, we need to add the extra 16 bananas to the 30 bananas per month:
   30 bananas + 16 bananas = 46 bananas per month

Therefore, the monkey gets 46 bananas in a month.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's approach this step by step:

1) We know that a circle has 360 degrees in total.

2) The starfish has 5 arms, which means we need to divide the circle into 5 equal sections.

3) To find the number of degrees in each section, we need to divide the total number of degrees in the circle by the number of sections (which is the same as the number of arms).

4) Mathematically, this can be represented as:
   
   Degrees in each section = Total degrees in the circle Ã· Number of sections
                            = 360 Ã· 5
                            = &lt;&lt;360/5=72&gt;&gt;72

Therefore, if the 360 degrees in a circle were to be equally divided amongst the starfish's 5 arms, each section would have 72 degrees.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same approach as before.

Given:
- The unusual starfish has 17 arms.
- A circle has 360 degrees.

Step 1: Determine the number of equal sections the circle needs to be divided into.
The number of sections is equal to the number of arms the starfish has, which is 17.

Step 2: Calculate the number of degrees in each section by dividing the total degrees in the circle by the number of sections.

Degrees in each section = Total degrees in the circle Ã· Number of sections
                         = 360 Ã· 17
                         = &lt;&lt;360/17=21.176470588235293&gt;&gt;21.176470588235293 (rounded to 15 decimal places)

Since degrees are usually expressed as whole numbers, we can round this value to the nearest whole number:
Degrees in each section â‰ˆ 21 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

* The toy store currently has 26 stuffed rabbits.
* They will order an additional 84 stuffed rabbits.
* They will also order 36 stuffed bears.

To find the total number of stuffed animals, we need to:
1. Add the current number of stuffed rabbits to the additional stuffed rabbits they will order.
2. Add the number of stuffed bears they will order to the total number of stuffed rabbits.

Step 1: Total number of stuffed rabbits
* Current stuffed rabbits = 26
* Additional stuffed rabbits = 84
* Total stuffed rabbits = 26 + 84 = 110

Step 2: Total number of stuffed animals
* Total stuffed rabbits = 110
* Stuffed bears = 36
* Total stuffed animals = 110 + 36 = 146

Therefore, after ordering the additional stuffed rabbits and bears, the toy store will have a total of 146 stuffed animals.

* They received a special order of 1 rare stuffed panda.

To find the new total number of stuffed animals, we need to:
1. Add the special order of 1 stuffed panda to the previous total of stuffed animals.

Step 1: New total number of stuffed animals
* Previous total stuffed animals = 146
* Special order of stuffed panda = 1

            Earlier we calculated that a dolphin needs approximately 96 kilograms of fish and 22 kilograms of squid every day to stay healthy. But what if instead, each day the dolphin had 96 kilograms of fish and only 8 kilograms of squid? Then, how much total food in kilograms would the dolphin need if it ate this diet unchanged for 59 days?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the updated information:
* A dolphin needs approximately 96 kg of fish every day.
* A dolphin needs approximately 8 kg of squid every day (instead of 22 kg).
* We want to know the total amount of fish and squid needed for 59 days.

To find the total amount of fish and squid needed, we can:
1. Calculate the total amount of fish needed for 59 days.
2. Calculate the total amount of squid needed for 59 days.
3. Add the total amounts of fish and squid together.

Step 1: Total amount of fish needed for 59 days
* Daily fish needed = 96 kg
* Total fish needed = 96 kg Ã— 59 days = 5,664 kg

Step 2: Total amount of squid needed for 59 days
* Daily squid needed = 8 kg
* Total squid needed = 8 kg Ã— 59 days = 472 kg

Step 3: Total amount of fish and squid needed for 59 days
* Total fish and squid needed = Total fish needed + Total squid needed
* Total fish and squid needed = 5,664 kg + 472 kg = 6,136 kg

Total building blocks = Initial blocks + Received blocks
Total building blocks = 18 + 55 = 73

Step 2: Multiply the total number of building blocks by the initial number of building blocks Mandy had.
Final number of building blocks = Total building blocks Ã— Initial blocks

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The region usually receives 53 inches of rain each year.
   * In a certain year, it received 7 inches less than the usual amount.

2. To find the amount of rain the region received in that particular year, we need to subtract the decrease in rainfall from the usual amount:
   * Amount of rain in the certain year = Usual amount of rain - Decrease in rainfall
   * Amount of rain in the certain year = 53 inches - 7 inches
   * Amount of rain in the certain year = 46 inches

Therefore, in the year when the region received less rainfall, it received 46 inches of rain.

   * In a certain year, it received 7 inches less than the usual amount.

2. To find the amount of rain the region received in that particular year, we need to subtract the decrease in rainfall from the usual amount:
   * Amount of rain in the certain year = Usual amount of rain - Decrease in rainfall
   * Amount of rain in the certain year = 69 inches - 7 inches

Given:
- Each store already has 9 binoculars from the first distribution.
- The second manufacturing facility produced 4104 binoculars.
- The binoculars from the second facility are divided equally among 57 stores.

Step 1: Calculate the number of binoculars each store receives from the second facility.
Binoculars per store from the second facility = 4104 Ã· 57
Binoculars per store from the second facility = 72

Step 2: Add the binoculars from the first distribution and the second distribution for each store.
Total binoculars per store = Binoculars from the first distribution + Binoculars from the second distribution
Total binoculars per store = 9 + 72 = 81

Therefore, after accounting for the additional shipment from the second manufacturing facility, each store ends up with a total of 81 binoculars.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of DSLR cameras in the shop before the promotion.
Total cameras before promotion = Initial stock + New delivery
Total cameras before promotion = 25 + 71 = 96

Step 2: Calculate the number of cameras for promotion by multiplying the total number of cameras by 56.
Cameras for promotion = Total cameras before promotion Ã— 56
Cameras for promotion = 96 Ã— 56 = 5,376

- Each large block can be cut into 1424 bars of soap.
- The soap is packaged in bundles of 16 bars each.

To find out how many packages they can make from one large block of soap, we need to divide the total number of bars from one block by the number of bars in each package.

1424 Ã· 16 = &lt;&lt;1424/16=89&gt;&gt;89

            Continuing from the initial situation in the soap manufacturing factory, suppose now they have decided to cut the large soap blocks into smaller bars such that each block can now be cut into 1424 bars of soap.

- Each large block can be cut into 1424 bars of soap (unchanged).
- The soap is now packaged in bundles of 36 bars each (changed from 16).

To find out how many packages they can make from one large block of soap under this new arrangement, we need to divide the total number of bars from one block by the new number of bars in each package.

1424 Ã· 36 = &lt;&lt;1424/36=39.5555555555556&gt;&gt;39.5555555555556

However, we can't have a fraction of a package, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

39.5555555555556 rounded down to the nearest whole number is 39.

Therefore, under the new arrangement, they can make 39 packages of soap from one large block.

1. The printer prints 2 sheets of paper each second.
2. Each sheet of paper has 37 letters.
3. So, in one second, the printer prints 2 Ã— 37 = 74 letters.
4. The printer continues to print at this rate for 95 seconds.

To find the total number of letters printed in 95 seconds, we multiply the number of letters printed per second by the total number of seconds:

Letters printed per second = 2 Ã— 37 = 74
Total seconds = 95

Total letters printed = Letters printed per second Ã— Total seconds

Given:
- The printer prints 2 sheets of paper each second.
- Each sheet of paper has 4 letters (instead of 37).

Step 1: Calculate the number of letters printed per second.
Letters printed per second = Sheets per second Ã— Letters per sheet
Letters printed per second = 2 Ã— 4 = 8

Step 2: Calculate the total number of letters printed in 95 seconds.
Total letters printed = Letters printed per second Ã— Total seconds
Total letters printed = 8 Ã— 95 = 760

* Reduced rate per minute = 57 milligrams/minute - 44 milligrams
* Reduced rate per minute = &lt;&lt;57-44=13&gt;&gt; 13 milligrams/minute

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of magical dust sprinkled in 52 minutes at the reduced rate

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* John took 30 pictures with his new camera.
* He accidentally deleted 81 pictures.
* He was able to recover 61 of the deleted pictures.

To find out how many pictures John has now, we need to:
1. Find out how many pictures were permanently deleted.
2. Add the number of pictures he took with his new camera to the number of pictures he was able to recover.

Step 1: Find the number of permanently deleted pictures
* Permanently deleted pictures = Accidentally deleted pictures - Recovered pictures
* Permanently deleted pictures = 81 - 61 = 20

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pictures John has now
* Total pictures = Pictures taken with the new camera + Recovered pictures
* Total pictures = 30 + 61 = 91

Therefore, John now has 91 pictures.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The tailor uses 20 square feet of fabric to make one teddy bear.
   * The tailor wants to make 20 teddy bears.
   * The tailor uses the same amount of fabric for every teddy bear.

2. To find the total fabric needed, we need to multiply the fabric used for one teddy bear by the number of teddy bears the tailor wants to make.
   * Fabric needed for one teddy bear = 20 square feet
   * Number of teddy bears to be made = 20
   * Total fabric needed = 20 square feet Ã— 20

   * Each pair of binoculars costs $27
   * The store bought 23 pairs

2. Add the tax to the cost:
   * Tax = $9

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from the previous problem and calculate the new total cost after adding the discounted pair of binoculars.

Given:
- The store owner already paid $630 for 23 pairs of binoculars, including tax.
- The store owner wants to buy an additional pair of binoculars.
- The additional pair of binoculars has a discount of $95.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the additional pair of binoculars after the discount.
Cost of additional pair = Regular price - Discount
Cost of additional pair = $27 - $95 = -$68

Note: The negative value indicates that the discount is greater than the regular price. In this case, the store owner will not have to pay for the additional pair of binoculars.

Step 2: Calculate the new total cost.
New total cost = Previous total cost + Cost of additional pair
New total cost = $630 + $0 = $630

Since the discount is greater than the price of the additional pair, the store owner will not have to pay anything extra. The total amount the store owner needs to pay remains the same as before.

Given:
- Each pair of binoculars now costs $27
- There's a fixed tax of $9
- The store owner decides to buy 13 pairs from the new shipment

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the binoculars before tax.
Cost before tax = Price per pair Ã— Number of pairs
Cost before tax = $27 Ã— 13 = $351

Step 2: Add the fixed tax to the cost before tax to get the total cost.
Total cost = Cost before tax + Fixed tax
Total cost = $351 + $9 = $360

Therefore, the total cost for the store owner to buy 13 pairs of binoculars from the new shipment, including the $9 fixed tax, would be $360.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the total number of windows in the building is 704.
2. We also know that the building has 8 floors.
3. Each floor has the same number of windows.

To find the number of windows on each floor, we need to divide the total number of windows by the number of floors:

* Number of windows on each floor = Total windows Ã· Number of floors
* Number of windows on each floor = 704 Ã· 8
* Number of windows on each floor = 88

Therefore, each floor has 88 windows.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            After figuring out the total number of windows the maintenance team cleaned in a day, let's consider a different scenario. What if the building had originally been built with 704 windows spread over 71 floors instead of 8? How many windows would there be on each floor then?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's approach this new scenario step by step:

1. The building now has a total of 704 windows.
2. The building now has 71 floors instead of 8.
3. We assume that each floor still has the same number of windows.

To find the number of windows on each floor, we divide the total number of windows by the number of floors:

* Number of windows on each floor = Total windows Ã· Number of floors
* Number of windows on each floor = 704 Ã· 71

Now, let's perform the division:
* 704 Ã· 71 = 9 remainder 65

This means that if we distribute the windows evenly across the 71 floors, there will be 9 windows on each floor, with 65 windows remaining.

In this case, it's not possible to have the same number of windows on each floor. The most logical distribution would be to have 10 windows on 65 floors and 9 windows on the remaining 6 floors.

### Answer: The windows cannot be evenly distributed among the 71 floors. The most logical distribution would be 10 windows on 65 floors and 9 windows on 6 floors.</pre>

* Each household owns an average of 77 cats.
* There are 69 households in the town.

To find the total number of cats in the town, we need to multiply the number of cats per household by the number of households.

Total cats = Cats per household Ã— Number of households
Total cats = 77 Ã— 69 = 5,313

Therefore, there are 5,313 cats in total in the town.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll first find the total number of cats in the town before the 91 cats were moved, and then subtract 91 from that total.

Given:
- Each household owns an average of 77 cats.
- There are 69 households in the town.
- 91 cats were moved to another town.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cats in the town before the cats were moved.
Total cats before = Cats per household Ã— Number of households
Total cats before = 77 Ã— 69 = 5,313

Step 2: Subtract the number of cats moved from the total number of cats.
Cats left in the town = Total cats before - Cats moved
Cats left in the town = 5,313 - 91 = 5,222

Therefore, there are 5,222 cats left in the town after 91 cats were moved to another town.

Given:
- John's cucumber plant produces 59 cucumbers.
- Mary's cucumber plant produces as many cucumbers as John's but minus the difference between John's cucumbers and 73.

Step 1: Find the difference between John's cucumbers and 73.
Difference = 73 - John's cucumbers
Difference = 73 - 59 = 14

Step 2: Calculate the number of cucumbers Mary's plant produced.
Mary's cucumbers = John's cucumbers + Difference
Mary's cucumbers = 59 + 14 = 73

Therefore, Mary's cucumber plant produces 73 cucumbers in this case.

Given:
- The pet store currently has 35 white mice, 86 brown mice, and 39 black mice.
- The pet store decides to double the quantity of each species of mouse.

Step 1: Calculate the new number of white mice after doubling.
New white mice = 2 Ã— Current white mice
New white mice = 2 Ã— 35 = 70

Step 2: Calculate the new number of brown mice after doubling.
New brown mice = 2 Ã— Current brown mice
New brown mice = 2 Ã— 86 = 172

Step 3: Calculate the new number of black mice after doubling.
New black mice = 2 Ã— Current black mice
New black mice = 2 Ã— 39 = 78

Step 4: Calculate the new total number of mice by adding the new quantities of each species.
New total mice = New white mice + New brown mice + New black mice
New total mice = 70 + 172 + 78 = 320

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, just like we did for the previous farmer.

Given:
- The second farmer initially owns 25 km of farmland.
- They decided to expand by 77 km.
- They had to give back 71 km due to legal issues.

Step 1: Calculate the new total farmland after expansion.
New total after expansion = Initial farmland + Expansion
New total after expansion = 25 km + 77 km = 102 km

Step 2: Calculate the farmland left after the decrease due to legal issues.
Farmland left after decrease = New total after expansion - Decrease
Farmland left after decrease = 102 km - 71 km = 31 km

Therefore, the second farmer has 31 km of farmland left after their expansion and subsequent decrease.

Given:
- The paint company prepared 8930 liters of paint.
- Each paint bucket can hold 95 liters of paint.
- The company was missing 73 paint buckets.
- They found 59 buckets in the warehouse.

Step 1: Calculate the number of buckets filled initially.
Number of buckets filled = Total amount of paint Ã· Capacity of each bucket
Number of buckets filled = 8930 Ã· 95 = 94 (rounded down)

Step 2: Subtract the missing buckets from the initially filled buckets.
Buckets after missing = Initially filled buckets - Missing buckets
Buckets after missing = 94 - 73 = 21

Step 3: Add the found buckets to the remaining buckets.
Total buckets now = Buckets after missing + Found buckets
Total buckets now = 21 + 59 = 80

Therefore, the company has 80 buckets in total now.

Total time = 1620 minutes

To find the total number of eggs laid, we need to divide the total time by the updated time interval between laying eggs.

Total time = 1620 minutes
Updated time interval between laying eggs = 47 minutes

Number of eggs laid = Total time Ã· Updated time interval between laying eggs
Number of eggs laid = 1620 Ã· 47

To perform this division, we can use long division or a calculator.

* The beachcomber had 3,164 seashells after 42 days.
* He lost one seashell down a seaside crevice.
* The next day, he collected 32 more seashells.

Now, let's calculate the total number of seashells:

1. Subtract the lost seashell from the original total:
   * Remaining seashells = Original total - Lost seashell
   * Remaining seashells = 3,164 - 1 = 3,163 seashells

2. Add the newly collected seashells to the remaining total:
   * New total = Remaining seashells + Newly collected seashells
   * New total = 3,163 + 32 = 3,195 seashells

So, after losing one seashell and collecting 32 more the next day, the beachcomber now has a total of 3,195 seashells.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Let's revisit our beachcomber. After reconsidering his collection habit, he realizes he has been actually collecting an average of 89 seashells per day instead of 74, over the same 42 day period. He still found that additional 56 seashells hidden in the sand. Now, how many seashells does he have in total after 42 days?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Alright, let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. Find the number of seashells collected over 42 days:
   * The beachcomber collects an average of 89 seashells per day.
   * In 42 days, the number of seashells collected will be: 89 Ã— 42 = 3,738 seashells

2. Add the additional seashells found hidden in the sand:
   * The beachcomber found 56 additional seashells hidden in the sand.
   * Total seashells = Seashells collected in 42 days + Additional seashells found
   * Total seashells = 3,738 + 56 = 3,794 seashells

Therefore, with the updated information, the beachcomber has a total of 3,794 seashells after 42 days.

### Answer: 3,794 seashells</pre>
