1. John initially has 2 tomatoes.
2. He found the same amount of tomatoes in his garden, which means he found 2 more tomatoes.
   * Total tomatoes after finding them in his garden = 2 + 2 = 4 tomatoes

3. Later, he picked 7 more tomatoes from his neighbor's garden.

1. John initially has 2 tomatoes.
2. He found the same amount of tomatoes in his garden, which means he found 2 more tomatoes.

Given:
- Scientist Randy is using 8 kg of Rocket Fuel A.

Step 1: Add the amounts of Rocket Fuel A and Rocket Fuel B.
Total rocket fuel = Rocket Fuel A + Rocket Fuel B
Total rocket fuel = 8 kg + 7 kg

- Initially, there was 8 kg of Rocket Fuel A and 7 kg of Rocket Fuel B, which totaled 15 kg of rocket fuel.
- Julia added an extra 5 kg of Rocket Fuel C to the mixture.

To find the new total amount of rocket fuel, we need to add the initial total and the extra Rocket Fuel C.

Step 1: Add the initial total rocket fuel and the extra Rocket Fuel C.
New total rocket fuel = Initial total rocket fuel + Extra Rocket Fuel C
New total rocket fuel = 15 kg + 5 kg
New total rocket fuel = 20 kg

Therefore, after Julia added the extra 5 kg of Rocket Fuel C, there is now a total of 20 kg of rocket fuel in the mixture.

Given:
- Randy is using 7 kg of Rocket Fuel A.

Step 1: Add the amounts of Rocket Fuel A and Rocket Fuel B.
Total rocket fuel before adding Rocket Fuel C = Rocket Fuel A + Rocket Fuel B
Total rocket fuel before adding Rocket Fuel C = 7 kg + 7 kg

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Bill found 11 balloons at the park.
   * Later, during a birthday party, he found 3 more balloons.

2. To find the total number of balloons Bill found, we need to add the balloons he found at the park and the balloons he found during the birthday party.

3. Add the number of balloons:
   * Balloons found at the park = 11
   * Balloons found during the birthday party = 3
   * Total balloons = Balloons at the park + Balloons at the party
   * Total balloons = 11 + 3 = 14

Therefore, Bill found a total of 14 balloons.

* Emily starts at the starting point and heads towards the first landmark, which is 3 km away.
* After reaching the first landmark, she heads for the second landmark.
* The second landmark is 17 km away from the first landmark.

Now, let's calculate the total distance Emily planned to cover:
1. Distance from the starting point to the first landmark = 3 km
2. Distance from the first landmark to the second landmark = 17 km
3. Total distance = Distance from starting point to first landmark + Distance from first landmark to second landmark
   * Total distance = 3 km + 17 km

Total castles = Initial castles + New castle
Total castles = 17 + 1 = &lt;&lt;17+1=18&gt;&gt;18

Therefore, the king now owns 18 castles.

            Let's say Caitlin changed her mind and she initially bought only 4 cartons of milk instead of 7. She still went shopping a second time and bought the same additional 11 cartons. Now, how many cartons of milk did Caitlin buy in total?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the problem with the new information:
* Caitlin bought 4 cartons of milk initially (instead of 7).
* She then bought an additional 11 cartons of milk (same as before).

To find the total number of cartons Caitlin bought, we need to add the number of cartons she bought in both shopping trips.

Total cartons = Initial cartons + Additional cartons
Total cartons = 4 + 11
Total cartons = &lt;&lt;4+11=15&gt;&gt;15

Therefore, with the updated information, Caitlin bought a total of 15 cartons of milk.

   * Maya blew 17 more bubbles than Sebastian.

2. Calculate the number of bubbles Maya blew:
   * Maya's bubbles = Sebastian's bubbles + 17
   * Maya's bubbles = 2 + 17 = 19

3. Calculate the total number of bubbles Sebastian and Maya blew together:
   * Total bubbles = Sebastian's bubbles + Maya's bubbles
   * Total bubbles = 2 + 19 = 21

Therefore, Sebastian and Maya blew a total of 21 bubbles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem again with the updated information:

1. The princess starts with 2 magical stones.

2. The wizard doubles the number of her stones:
   * Doubled stones = 2 Ã— 2 = 4 stones

3. After the wizard doubles her stones, the princess finds 15 more stones (instead of 11):
   * Total stones = Doubled stones + Found stones
   * Total stones = 4 + 15 = 19 stones

Therefore, considering the new information, the princess now has 19 magical stones.

* The zoo has giraffes in two areas
* There are 8 giraffes in one area

To find the total number of giraffes in the zoo, we need to add the number of giraffes in both areas.

Number of giraffes in the first area = 8
Number of giraffes in the second area = 7

Total number of giraffes = Number of giraffes in the first area + Number of giraffes in the second area

Given:
- The zoo had 15 giraffes in total.
- The zoo brings in 3 more giraffes.

To find the new total number of giraffes, we need to add the number of giraffes they brought in to the previous total.

Previous total number of giraffes = 15
Number of giraffes brought in = 3

New total number of giraffes = Previous total number of giraffes + Number of giraffes brought in
New total number of giraffes = 15 + 3 = &lt;&lt;15+3=18&gt;&gt;18

Therefore, after bringing in 3 more giraffes, there are now 18 giraffes in the zoo in total.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Draco finds 13 coins in a cave
* Draco finds 5 more coins in the forest

To find the total number of gold coins Draco gathered, we need to add the coins he found in the cave and the coins he found in the forest.

Coins found in the cave: 13
Coins found in the forest: 5

Total coins gathered = Coins found in the cave + Coins found in the forest
Total coins gathered = 13 + 5 = &lt;&lt;13+5=18&gt;&gt;18

Therefore, Draco gathered a total of 18 gold coins.

* Draco gathered a total of 18 gold coins (from the previous question)
* Spot found 2 more gold coins during his own adventure

To find the total number of gold coins the two dragons have, we need to add the coins Draco gathered and the coins Spot found.

Coins Draco gathered: 18
Coins Spot found: 2

Total coins the two dragons have = Coins Draco gathered + Coins Spot found
Total coins the two dragons have = 18 + 2 = &lt;&lt;18+2=20&gt;&gt;20

Therefore, Draco and Spot have a total of 20 gold coins together.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Millie originally had 2 dresses.
   * Her mom gave her the same amount of dresses as she originally had.

2. Calculate the number of dresses Millie's mom gave her:
   * Dresses from mom = Original number of dresses
   * Dresses from mom = 2

3. Calculate the total number of dresses Millie has now:
   * Total dresses = Original dresses + Dresses from mom
   * Total dresses = 2 + 2
   * Total dresses = 4

Therefore, Millie now has a total of 4 dresses.

Given:
- Millie had 4 dresses after her mom gave her the same amount as she originally had.
- Millie's aunt presents her with 11 more dresses.

Step 1: Add the number of dresses Millie's aunt gave her to the total number of dresses she had after her mom's gift.

Total dresses = Dresses after mom's gift + Dresses from aunt
Total dresses = 4 + 11
Total dresses = 15

1. Understand the given information:
   * Samantha has 5 tent poles.
   * She needs an equal number of tent poles for her friend's tent.
   * After setting up both tents, she realizes she needs another set of 5 poles for a small storage tent.

2. Calculate the number of tent poles needed for her friend's tent:
   * Tent poles for friend's tent = 5 (same as Samantha's)

3. Calculate the number of tent poles needed for the small storage tent:
   * Tent poles for small storage tent = 5

4. Calculate the total number of tent poles Samantha needs:
   * Total tent poles = Samantha's tent poles + Friend's tent poles + Small storage tent poles
   * Total tent poles = 5 + 5 + 5
   * Total tent poles = 15

Therefore, Samantha needs a total of 15 tent poles.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Robert initially has 16 dollars in his wallet.
   * He earns an additional 3 dollars for helping his neighbor with groceries.

2. To find out how much money Robert has now, we need to add the money he earned to the amount he already had:
   * Money in Robert's wallet now = Initial amount + Money earned
   * Money in Robert's wallet now = $16 + $3

* Tommy initially had 1 card from his favorite soccer players.
* He bought 4 more cards.

We can use the same approach as before to find the total number of soccer cards Tommy has now.

Total cards = Initial cards + Bought cards
Total cards = 1 + 4
Total cards = 5

Therefore, if Tommy originally had only 1 soccer card and then bought 4 more, he would have a total of 5 soccer cards.

1. Initially, the farmer had 1 apple tree in his orchard.

2. He then plants 2 more apple trees.
   * Total apple trees after planting 2 more = 1 + 2 = 3

3. Next, he plants the number of trees equivalent to the first number in the orchard.
   * The first number in the orchard was 1.
   * So, he plants 1 more apple tree.
   * Total apple trees after planting 1 more = 3 + 1 = 4

Therefore, there are now 4 apple trees in the farmer's orchard.

            After the previous situation, the farmer realizes he made a mistake counting. Actually, he initially had 1 apple tree and he added 3 more, not 2. With the same equation as before, where the number of trees planted is added to the initial number of trees, and the resulting number is then added to the initial number of trees. How many apple trees does the farmer have in his orchard now?

2. He then plants 3 more apple trees.

3. Now, he plants the number of trees equivalent to the initial number in the orchard (which was 1).
   * Total apple trees after planting 1 more = 4 + 1 = 5

4. Finally, he adds the resulting number of trees (5) to the initial number of trees (1).
   * Total apple trees after adding the resulting number to the initial number = 5 + 1 = 6

Therefore, with the corrected information and following the given equation, the farmer now has 6 apple trees in his orchard.

Initial gems discovered: 7

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given:
- Peter initially has 6 candles.
- Mary gives Peter 5 more candles as a gift.

To find the total number of candles Peter has after receiving the gift, we need to add the number of candles he had initially and the number of candles Mary gave him.

Total candles = Initial candles + Candles received as a gift
Total candles = 6 + 5 = 11

Therefore, after receiving the 5 candles from Mary, Peter would have a total of 11 candles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Captain Redbeard initially hid 15 pieces of treasure on an island.
* He then found 3 more pieces of treasure while traveling.

To find the total number of treasure pieces Captain Redbeard has now, we need to add the number of pieces he hid on the island to the number of pieces he found later.

Total pieces of treasure = Pieces hidden on the island + Pieces found later
Total pieces of treasure = 15 + 3
Total pieces of treasure = &lt;&lt;15+3=18&gt;&gt;18

Therefore, Captain Redbeard now has 18 pieces of treasure in total.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* The wizard casts a spell twice during the duel.
* Each spell summons 4 mystical eagles.

To find the total number of mystical eagles summoned, we need to:
1. Find the number of eagles summoned per spell cast.
2. Multiply the number of eagles per spell by the number of times the wizard casts the spell.

Step 1: Number of eagles summoned per spell cast
* Each spell summons 4 mystical eagles.

Step 2: Total number of eagles summoned
* The wizard casts the spell twice.
* Total eagles summoned = Eagles per spell Ã— Number of times the spell is cast
* Total eagles summoned = 4 Ã— 2 = &lt;&lt;4*2=8&gt;&gt;8

* In the first round, the wizard cast 2 spells, each summoning 4 mystical eagles.
* After the first round, the wizard cast 2 more spells, each summoning 4 mystical eagles.

To find the total number of mystical eagles summoned, we need to:
1. Find the number of eagles summoned in the first round.
2. Find the number of eagles summoned after the first round.
3. Add the number of eagles summoned in both rounds.

Step 1: Number of eagles summoned in the first round
* Eagles summoned in the first round = 4 Ã— 2 = &lt;&lt;4*2=8&gt;&gt;8

Step 2: Number of eagles summoned after the first round
* Eagles summoned after the first round = 4 Ã— 2 = &lt;&lt;4*2=8&gt;&gt;8

Step 3: Total number of eagles summoned
* Total eagles summoned = Eagles summoned in the first round + Eagles summoned after the first round
* Total eagles summoned = 8 + 8 = &lt;&lt;8+8=16&gt;&gt;16

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information based on the new scenario:
* Tommy found 1 gemstone on his way to school.
* Later, he found a treasure chest with 19 gemstones (instead of 14).

To find the total number of gemstones Tommy has now, we need to add the gemstone he found on his way to school and the gemstones he found in the treasure chest.

Total gemstones = Gemstone found on the way to school + Gemstones in the treasure chest
Total gemstones = 1 + 19 = &lt;&lt;1+19=20&gt;&gt;20

Therefore, with the updated information, Tommy would have 20 gemstones.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Bobby climbs 9 steps to reach the top of the jungle gym.
   * The slide is 6 steps longer than his initial climb.

2. Calculate the length of the slide:
   * Length of the slide = Initial climb + 6 steps

Given:
- The slide Bobby just took is 15 steps long.
- The ladder he chooses to go back up is 2 steps longer than the slide.

Now, let's calculate the length of the ladder:

1. Length of the ladder = Length of the slide + 2 steps
2. Length of the ladder = 15 steps + 2 steps
3. Length of the ladder = 17 steps

Therefore, the ladder Bobby chooses to go back up is 17 steps long.

1. Understand the updated information:
   * This time, Bobby climbs 14 steps to reach the top of the jungle gym.
   * The slide is still 6 steps longer than his initial climb.

2. Calculate the length of the slide:
   * Length of the slide = New initial climb + 6 steps
   * Length of the slide = 14 steps + 6 steps
   * Length of the slide = 20 steps

Therefore, with Bobby's new initial climb of 14 steps, the slide is now 20 steps long.

Total bars of soap = 16 + 4
Total bars of soap = 20

Morning production + Afternoon production = 2 + 6 = &lt;&lt;2+6=8&gt;&gt;8 packs

Step 2: Add the extra evening production to the total daily production.
Total daily production = Morning and afternoon production + Evening production

1. Fiona started with 1 square in her drawing.
2. She then drew an additional 13 squares.
   * After Fiona's addition, the total number of squares is: 1 + 13 = 14 squares

3. Later, her brother Kevin added 6 more squares to the drawing.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Harry found 1 stick suitable for marshmallow roasting.
   * Patricia found 19 more sticks.

2. To find the total number of sticks they have for marshmallow roasting, we need to add the number of sticks Harry found and the number of sticks Patricia found.

3. Add the sticks:
   * Total sticks = Harry's sticks + Patricia's sticks
   * Total sticks = 1 + 19
   * Total sticks = 20

Therefore, Harry and Patricia have a total of 20 sticks for marshmallow roasting.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given:
- Harry found 19 sticks suitable for marshmallow roasting.
- Patricia found 1 more stick.

To find the total number of sticks they have for marshmallow roasting, we need to add the number of sticks Harry found and the number of sticks Patricia found.

Add the sticks:
* Total sticks = Harry's sticks + Patricia's sticks
* Total sticks = 19 + 1
* Total sticks = 20

Therefore, even with the updated information, Harry and Patricia still have a total of 20 sticks for marshmallow roasting.

Given:
* Thomas used 7 large snowballs for the body.
* Thomas used 2 smaller snowballs for the head.
* Lucy added 8 extra decorative snowballs for buttons and facial features.

Step 1: Calculate the number of snowballs Thomas used.
Thomas's snowballs = Snowballs for body + Snowballs for head
Thomas's snowballs = 7 + 2 = &lt;&lt;7+2=9&gt;&gt;9

Step 2: Calculate the total number of snowballs used by adding Lucy's decorative snowballs to Thomas's snowballs.
Total snowballs = Thomas's snowballs + Lucy's decorative snowballs
Total snowballs = 9 + 8 = &lt;&lt;9+8=17&gt;&gt;17

Therefore, Thomas and Lucy used a total of 17 snowballs to build and decorate the snowman.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the total number of snowballs Lucy would need to build her version of the snowman.

Given:
* Lucy plans to use 8 large snowballs for the body of the snowman.
* She also plans to use 2 smaller snowballs for the body.
* We can assume that Lucy will use the same number of snowballs for the head as Thomas did, which is 2.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of snowballs needed for the body.
Total snowballs for the body = Large snowballs + Smaller snowballs
Total snowballs for the body = 8 + 2 = &lt;&lt;8+2=10&gt;&gt;10

Step 2: Calculate the total number of snowballs needed for the head.
Total snowballs for the head = 2

Step 3: Calculate the total number of snowballs needed for Lucy's version of the snowman.
Total snowballs needed = Total snowballs for the body + Total snowballs for the head
Total snowballs needed = 10 + 2 = &lt;&lt;10+2=12&gt;&gt;12

Therefore, Lucy would need a total of 12 snowballs to build her version of the snowman.

* The firefighter's height is 2 feet.
* The distance from the ground to the window is 5 feet plus the firefighter's height.
* There are an additional 11 feet between the window and the people he needs to rescue.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the distance from the ground to the window:
   * Distance from ground to window = 5 feet + firefighter's height
   * Distance from ground to window = 5 feet + 2 feet = 7 feet

2. Calculate the total distance the firefighter needs to climb:
   * Total distance = Distance from ground to window + Distance from window to people
   * Total distance = 7 feet + 11 feet = 18 feet

Therefore, the firefighter needs to climb a total of 18 feet to rescue the people.

* The firefighter has already climbed 18 feet to reach the people.
* After rescuing the people, he needs to go an additional distance equal to his own height to get them onto a safe platform.
* The firefighter's height is 2 feet.

Now, let's calculate the additional distance and the total distance traveled:

3. Calculate the additional distance to reach the safe platform:
   * Additional distance = Firefighter's height
   * Additional distance = 2 feet

4. Calculate the total distance traveled by the firefighter:
   * Total distance traveled = Distance climbed to reach people + Additional distance to safe platform
   * Total distance traveled = 18 feet + 2 feet = 20 feet

Therefore, the firefighter has traveled a total of 20 feet to rescue the people and get them onto a safe platform.

* The firefighter's height is 2 feet.
* The distance from the ground to the window is 5 feet plus the firefighter's height.
* The distance between the window and the people he needed to rescue was actually 13 feet, not 11 feet.

Now, let's solve the problem again with the updated information:

1. Calculate the distance from the ground to the window (this remains the same as before):
   * Distance from ground to window = 5 feet + firefighter's height
   * Distance from ground to window = 5 feet + 2 feet = 7 feet

2. Calculate the total distance the firefighter needed to climb with the updated distance:
   * Total distance = Distance from ground to window + Updated distance from window to people
   * Total distance = 7 feet + 13 feet = 20 feet

Therefore, considering the new information, the firefighter needed to climb a total of 20 feet to rescue the people.

Total leaves blown off = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12 leaves

Therefore, with the addition of the even stronger gust, the wind blew a total of 12 leaves off the tree.

- George initially has 2 gallons of paint.
- Larry gives George an additional amount of paint equivalent to what George originally had.
- George then buys 7 more gallons of paint.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of paint George has after receiving paint from Larry.
George's initial paint + Paint given by Larry = 2 + 2 = 4 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of paint George has after buying 7 more gallons.
Paint after receiving from Larry + Paint bought by George = 4 + 7 = 11 gallons

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* Liam baked 4 cookies in the morning.
* Liam baked 10 more cookies in the evening.

To find the total number of cookies Liam baked, we need to add the number of cookies he baked in the morning and the number of cookies he baked in the evening.

Cookies baked in the morning: 4
Cookies baked in the evening: 10

Total cookies baked = Cookies baked in the morning + Cookies baked in the evening
Total cookies baked = 4 + 10 = 14

Therefore, Liam baked a total of 14 cookies.

* Liam baked 4 cookies in the morning.
* Liam baked 10 more cookies in the evening.
* Liam baked 2 additional cookies as a midnight snack.

To find the new total number of cookies Liam baked, we need to add the number of cookies he baked in the morning, the number of cookies he baked in the evening, and the number of cookies he baked as a midnight snack.

Cookies baked in the morning: 4
Cookies baked in the evening: 10
Cookies baked as a midnight snack: 2

New total cookies baked = Cookies baked in the morning + Cookies baked in the evening + Cookies baked as a midnight snack
New total cookies baked = 4 + 10 + 2 = 16

Therefore, with the additional 2 cookies baked as a midnight snack, Liam has now baked a total of 16 cookies.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Timmy initially has 4 giraffes.
   * He gets the same amount of giraffes he already had. This means he doubles his number of giraffes.
   * Then, he adds the amount of giraffes he originally had.

2. Calculate the number of giraffes Timmy has after doubling his initial amount:
   * Initial number of giraffes = 4
   * Number of giraffes after doubling = 4 Ã— 2 = 8

3. Add the original number of giraffes to the doubled amount:
   * Number of giraffes after doubling = 8
   * Original number of giraffes = 4
   * Total number of giraffes = 8 + 4 = 12

Therefore, Timmy now has 12 giraffes.

Given:
- Timmy has 12 giraffes (from the previous problem).
- Timmy also has 8 kangaroos.

To find the total number of animals, we simply add the number of giraffes and kangaroos:

Total animals = Number of giraffes + Number of kangaroos
Total animals = 12 + 8 = 20

Therefore, Timmy now has a total of 20 animals.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step, just like we did before, but with the new information that Timmy originally has 5 giraffes.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Timmy initially has 5 giraffes.
   * He gets the same amount of giraffes he already had. This means he doubles his number of giraffes.
   * Then, he adds the amount of giraffes he originally had.

2. Calculate the number of giraffes Timmy has after doubling his initial amount:
   * Initial number of giraffes = 5
   * Number of giraffes after doubling = 5 Ã— 2 = 10

3. Add the original number of giraffes to the doubled amount:
   * Number of giraffes after doubling = 10
   * Original number of giraffes = 5
   * Total number of giraffes = 10 + 5 = 15

Therefore, in this scenario where Timmy originally has 5 giraffes, he now has 15 giraffes after doubling his initial amount and adding the original number of giraffes.
