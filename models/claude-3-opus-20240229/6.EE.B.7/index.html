            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the additional distance James's binoculars cover, we need to subtract the distance the basic binoculars cover from the distance James's binoculars cover.

Given:
- James's binoculars can see 12 miles.
- Basic binoculars can see 6 miles.

Additional distance = Distance of James's binoculars - Distance of basic binoculars
Additional distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

Therefore, James's binoculars cover an additional 6 miles compared to the basic binoculars.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The box has a total of 641 balls.
   * 284 of those balls are yellow.

2. To find the number of balls that are not yellow, we need to subtract the number of yellow balls from the total number of balls.

3. Number of non-yellow balls = Total balls - Yellow balls
   * Number of non-yellow balls = 641 - 284
   * Number of non-yellow balls = 357

Therefore, there are 357 balls in the box that are not yellow.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red balls that should be added to the bag to make the total number of balls 355, given that there are already 44 green balls in the bag.

Given:
- The total number of balls in the bag should be 355.
- There are already 44 green balls in the bag.

Let's calculate the number of red balls needed:

Number of red balls = Total balls - Green balls
Number of red balls = 355 - 44
Number of red balls = &lt;&lt;355-44=311&gt;&gt;311

Therefore, 311 red balls should be added to the bag to make the total number of balls 355.

* There are a total of 601 toy cars in the shop.
* 321 of these toy cars are blue.

To find out how many toy cars are not blue, we need to subtract the number of blue toy cars from the total number of toy cars.

Total toy cars - Blue toy cars = Non-blue toy cars
601 - 321 = 280

Therefore, there are 280 toy cars that are not blue.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Each mouse needs 104 food units per day.
   * The group of mice requires 7592 food units for one day.

2. To find the number of mice in the group, we need to divide the total food units required by the group by the food units required by each mouse.

3. Calculation:
   * Number of mice = Total food units required by the group Ã· Food units required by each mouse

Given:
- The drummer practices 9234 beats per day.

Number of beats per solo = Total beats per day Ã· Number of times each solo is played
Number of beats per solo = 9234 Ã· 171 = 54

To check if this is correct, we can multiply the number of beats per solo by the number of times each solo is played:

Let's solve this step by step:
1. We know that the current total number of tigers is the sum of the original number of tigers and the newly added tigers.
2. So, if we subtract the number of newly added tigers from the current total, we will get the original number of tigers.

Original number of tigers = Current total - Newly added tigers

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The juice store has a total of 655 bottles of juice.
* 386 of these bottles are apple juice.

To find the number of bottles of other types of juice, we need to subtract the number of apple juice bottles from the total number of bottles.

Other types of juice = Total bottles - Apple juice bottles
Other types of juice = 655 - 386
Other types of juice = &lt;&lt;655-386=269&gt;&gt;269

Therefore, there are 269 bottles of other types of juice in the store.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much energy the star itself radiates per hour, we need to subtract the background units from the total units of energy radiated.

Given:
- The star system radiates a total of 401 units of energy per hour.
- This amount includes 82 background units.

To calculate the energy radiated by the star itself, we subtract the background units from the total units:

Energy radiated by the star = Total energy radiated - Background units
Energy radiated by the star = 401 - 82 = 319

Therefore, the star itself radiates 319 units of energy per hour.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The farmer initially had an unknown number of apples.
   * The farmer added 219 apples to the initial count.
   * After adding the apples, the total count became 348.

2. Let's represent the initial number of apples as a variable, say 'x'.

3. We can write an equation based on the given information:
   * Initial apples (x) + Added apples (219) = Total apples (348)
   * x + 219 = 348

4. To find the initial number of apples, we need to solve the equation for 'x'.
   * Subtract 219 from both sides of the equation:
     x + 219 - 219 = 348 - 219
     x = 348 - 219

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many feet the helicopter ascended after the initial 124 feet, we need to subtract the initial elevation from the final altitude.

Given:
- The helicopter started at an elevation of 124 feet.
- It reached a final altitude of 334 feet.

To calculate the additional ascent:
Additional ascent = Final altitude - Initial elevation
Additional ascent = 334 feet - 124 feet = &lt;&lt;334-124=210&gt;&gt;210 feet

Therefore, the helicopter ascended an additional 210 feet after the initial 124 feet.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The sailor is already 22 miles into his journey.
   * At the end of his journey, he is 161 miles away from his starting point.

2. To find how much farther he traveled from the 22-mile point, we need to subtract the distance he had already traveled from the total distance he ended up traveling.

3. Calculate the additional distance traveled:
   * Additional distance = Total distance - Distance already traveled
   * Additional distance = 161 miles - 22 miles
   * Additional distance = 139 miles

Therefore, the sailor traveled an additional 139 miles from the point he was at 22 miles.

To find the number of scoops of other flavors, we need to subtract the number of vanilla scoops from the total number of scoops:

* Scoops of other flavors = Total scoops - Vanilla scoops
* Scoops of other flavors = 482 - 357

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The school has a total of 632 books.
   * The English teacher has 271 of those books.

2. To find the number of books the other teachers have, we need to subtract the number of books the English teacher has from the total number of books:
   * Books with other teachers = Total books - Books with the English teacher
   * Books with other teachers = 632 - 271
   * Books with other teachers = 361

Therefore, the other teachers have 361 books.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the number of officers off duty, we need to subtract the number of officers on duty from the total number of officers.

Given:
- There are 524 police officers currently on the force.
- 376 of them are on duty.

To calculate the number of officers off duty, we do:
Total officers - Officers on duty = Officers off duty
524 - 376 = 148

Therefore, 148 officers are off duty.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The farmer has a total of 1190 tomatoes.
   * Each tomato plant produced exactly 35 tomatoes.

2. To find the number of tomato plants, we need to divide the total number of tomatoes by the number of tomatoes each plant produced:
   * Number of tomato plants = Total number of tomatoes Ã· Tomatoes per plant
   * Number of tomato plants = 1190 Ã· 35

1. Understand the given information:
   * The cat catches 32 mice every day.
   * The cat has caught a total of 1504 mice.
   * We need to find the number of days it took the cat to catch all the mice.

2. Set up an equation:
   * Let's say the number of days is x.
   * The cat catches 32 mice per day, so in x days, it would catch 32 Ã— x mice.
   * We know the total number of mice caught is 1504.
   * So, we can write the equation: 32 Ã— x = 1504

3. Solve the equation:
   * To solve for x, divide both sides of the equation by 32.
   * 32 Ã— x = 1504
   * x = 1504 Ã· 32
   * x = 47

Therefore, it took the cat 47 days to catch all 1504 mice.

1. We know that the wind turbine generates 8640 kWh of electricity when the wind speed is steady at 45 kph.
2. We need to find out how many kWh of electricity each kph of wind speed generates.

Let's set up an equation:
* Let x be the number of kWh generated per kph of wind speed.
* Then, 45 kph Ã— x kWh/kph = 8640 kWh

Now, let's solve for x:
* 45x = 8640

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The balloon seller had 179 balloons already.
* After inflating a new batch of balloons, the total number of balloons became 434.

To find out how many new balloons the seller inflated, we need to subtract the number of balloons they already had from the total number of balloons after inflating the new batch.

New balloons inflated = Total balloons after inflating - Balloons already had
New balloons inflated = 434 - 179
New balloons inflated = &lt;&lt;434-179=255&gt;&gt;255

Therefore, the balloon seller inflated 255 new balloons.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The bus operator counted a total of 631 passengers today.
* 362 passengers boarded the bus in the morning.

We need to find the number of passengers who boarded the bus in the afternoon.

Reasoning:
* The total number of passengers is the sum of the morning and afternoon passengers.
* If we subtract the number of morning passengers from the total, we will get the number of afternoon passengers.

Calculation:
* Afternoon passengers = Total passengers - Morning passengers
* Afternoon passengers = 631 - 362 = 269

Therefore, 269 passengers boarded the bus in the afternoon.

1. We know that blue paint and yellow paint were mixed to make green paint.
2. The total amount of green paint made is 280 liters.
3. The amount of blue paint used is 8 liters.
4. To find the amount of yellow paint used, we need to subtract the amount of blue paint from the total amount of green paint.

So, the amount of yellow paint used is:
* Yellow paint = Total green paint - Blue paint
* Yellow paint = 280 liters - 8 liters
* Yellow paint = 280 - 8 = &lt;&lt;280-8=272&gt;&gt;272 liters

Therefore, 272 liters of yellow paint were used to make the green paint.

            One of Mary's bracelets is made out of individual pieces, and she counted that there are 276 pieces in total. If Mary only adds pieces in sets of 4, what was the original count of pieces before she added the last set?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's approach this step by step:

1) We know that Mary adds pieces in sets of 4. This means that the total number of pieces (276) must be divisible by 4.

2) Let's check: 276 Ã· 4 = 69. This division works out perfectly, confirming that 276 is indeed divisible by 4.

3) Now, we want to find the number of pieces before the last set was added. In other words, we want to subtract one set of 4 from the total.

4) 276 - 4 = 272

Therefore, before Mary added the last set of 4 pieces, the bracelet had 272 pieces.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the number of monkeys in the zoo, we need to divide the total amount of food needed by the amount of food each monkey eats in a month.

Given:
- The zoo needs 4572 pounds of food to feed every monkey over a month.
- Each monkey eats 36 pounds of food in a month.

To calculate the number of monkeys, we divide the total food needed by the amount each monkey eats:

Number of monkeys = Total food needed Ã· Food per monkey
Number of monkeys = 4572 Ã· 36
Number of monkeys = &lt;&lt;4572/36=127&gt;&gt;127

Therefore, there are 127 monkeys in the zoo.

            A doll house can hold 16 dolls in each room. If it can house a total of 832 dolls, how many rooms are in the doll house?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that each room can hold 16 dolls.
2. The total number of dolls that can be housed is 832.
3. To find the number of rooms, we need to divide the total number of dolls by the number of dolls each room can hold.

Number of rooms = Total number of dolls Ã· Number of dolls per room
                = 832 Ã· 16
                = &lt;&lt;832/16=52&gt;&gt;52

Therefore, there are 52 rooms in the doll house.

            A luxurious watch costs $422. If the manufacturing cost is $200, how much is charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much is charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads, we need to subtract the manufacturing cost from the total cost of the watch.

Given:
- The luxurious watch costs $422.
- The manufacturing cost is $200.

Step 1: Calculate the amount charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads by subtracting the manufacturing cost from the total cost.
Brand value, sales profits, and other overheads = Total cost - Manufacturing cost
Brand value, sales profits, and other overheads = $422 - $200 = $222

Therefore, $222 is charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads.
