The left side value is 8, and the right side value is 7.

- &quot;&gt;&quot; if the left side value is greater than the right side value
- &quot;=&quot; if the left side value is equal to the right side value

In this case, 8 is greater than 7.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Following up on our previous comparison, now consider these two numbers and fill in the blank with one of these operators: &lt;, &gt;, or =.
4 _ 10 

For instance, if in our previous question we were comparing the heights of two trees (8 feet and 10 feet respectively), this question would now be comparing a shrub of 4 feet to that same 10 feet tree. Which symbol would be appropriate now?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Continuing with the comparison, let's now compare 4 and 10.

Just like in the previous question, 4 is less than 10. When counting from 4, you will reach 10 after 6 more numbers: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

Therefore, 4 &lt; 10.

Using your analogy, if the 10 feet tree remains the same, and we are now comparing it to a 4 feet shrub, the shrub is clearly shorter than the tree.

Filling in the blank with the correct operator:

4 &lt; 10

In this case, 7 is greater than 2. Therefore, we fill in the blank with the &quot;greater than&quot; symbol (&gt;).

            Continuing from the previous comparison, now consider two new numbers:

3 _ 8

Fill in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or = to complete the comparison. For example, if previously you were comparing the heights of two trees, consider this comparison for a scenario where the first tree is now shorter, standing at 3 meters instead of 4. How does this change your comparison?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous comparison, we had 3 &lt; 4, meaning 3 was less than 4.

Now, we are comparing 3 and 8.

Since 8 is even greater than 4, and 3 is less than 4, we can conclude that 3 is also less than 8.

Therefore, we fill in the blank with the &quot;less than&quot; symbol (&lt;) again.

3 &lt; 8

This statement reads as &quot;3 is less than 8&quot;.

In the context of comparing tree heights, if the first tree is now 3 meters tall instead of 4 meters, it is still shorter than the second tree, which is 8 meters tall. The comparison remains the same, with the first tree being shorter than the second tree.

1) 1 is less than 7 because when counting from 1, 2, 3, ..., we reach 1 before we reach 7.

1 &lt; 7

Regarding the follow-up question, if we change the original question to compare 1 apple and 7 oranges, the comparison remains the same. The quantity of apples decreased from 3 to 1, but this does not affect the fact that the number of apples is still less than the number of oranges.

When comparing two equal quantities, we use the equal sign (=) to show that they have the same value.

Therefore, the comparison can be written as:

10 = 10

This means that the number of apples (10) is equal to the number of oranges (10).

1) 6 is a smaller number than 10. 
2) When counting from 6 upwards, we will reach 10 after 4 more numbers: 7, 8, 9, and then 10.
3) Therefore, 6 is less than 10.

Comparing the two numbers:

- The largest possible value for this number is 8910 (if the missing digit is 9).

In the second number, 8 10, there is no missing digit.

Comparing the two numbers:
- The smallest possible value of the first number (8010) is greater than the second number (810).

Filling in the blank with the appropriate symbol:

In the previous task, when comparing 8 _ 5 and 8 5, the first number was greater than the second number. In this task, when comparing 8 _ 10 and 8 10, the first number is still greater than the second number, regardless of the missing digit.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">If we change the comparison from 2 _ 5 to 2 _ 9, the answer remains the same. Here's the reasoning:

1) Just like in the previous problem, 2 is less than 9 because when counting from 2, you need to count 7 more numbers to reach 9 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

2) On a number line, 2 is located to the left of 9, which means 2 is smaller than 9.

Therefore, even if we change the comparison to 2 _ 9, the answer remains the same:

2 &lt; 9

The inequality sign does not change because 2 is still less than 9, just like it was less than 5 in the previous problem.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare 5 and 2, we need to determine which number is greater or if they are equal.

5 is greater than 2 because when counting from 2, you will reach 5 after 2. This means that 5 comes after 2 in the number line, and thus, 5 is greater than 2.

Therefore, the comparison should be:

5 &gt; 2

4 is closer to 5 than 2, but 4 is still less than 5. When counting from 4, you will reach 5 after 4, meaning that 5 comes after 4 on the number line. Therefore, 5 is still greater than 4.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare 9 and 10, we need to determine which number is greater or if they are equal.

We know that 10 is greater than 1, as established in the previous comparison. Now, let's consider the relationship between 9 and 10.

9 is one unit less than 10. In other words, if we add 1 to 9, we get 10. Therefore, 9 is less than 10.

So, we fill in the blank with the &quot;less than&quot; symbol (&lt;):

9 &lt; 10

This means that 9 is less than 10.

4 is less than 6.

Therefore, the blank should be filled with the &quot;less than&quot; symbol, &quot;&lt;&quot;.

4 &lt; 6

Comparing this to the previous problem where we evaluated 7 _ 6:

1. The numbers being compared have changed. Previously, we were comparing 7 and 6, but now we are comparing 4 and 6.

2. The relationship between the numbers has changed. In the previous comparison, 7 was greater than 6 (7 &gt; 6). However, in the new comparison, 4 is less than 6 (4 &lt; 6).

3. The symbol used to represent the relationship has changed. Previously, we used the &quot;greater than&quot; symbol (&gt;), but now we use the &quot;less than&quot; symbol (&lt;).

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Earlier, we compared 5 and 1. Now, consider this comparison instead:

9 _ 1

Using the symbols &lt;, &gt;, or =, determine the relationship between these two numbers.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Similar to the previous comparison, we need to determine which number is greater or if they are equal.

9 is greater than 1 because when counting from 1, 9 comes after 1. This means that 9 is a larger quantity than 1.

Therefore, the correct symbol to fill in the blank is &quot;&gt;&quot;.

9 &gt; 1

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Continuing from the previous question where you compared 3 and 8, now let's consider a slight change. 

Compare the following numbers: 

3 _ 4

Fill in the blank with either &lt;, &gt;, or =. What changes when 8 is replaced by 4?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Now, we are comparing 3 and 4.

3 is still less than 4.

Therefore, we fill in the blank with the less than symbol (&lt;), just like in the previous question.

3 &lt; 4

The only change is that the difference between the two numbers is smaller. In the previous question, the difference between 3 and 8 was 5. In this question, the difference between 3 and 4 is only 1.

However, the comparison symbol remains the same (&lt;) because 3 is still less than 4, even though the difference is smaller.
