        In the morning, a sandwich shop makes 12 tuna sandwiches. Later, they make an additional 24 tuna sandwiches. How many tuna sandwiches did they make in total in the day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
- In the morning, the sandwich shop makes 12 tuna sandwiches.
- Later, they make an additional 24 tuna sandwiches.

To find the total number of tuna sandwiches made in the day, we need to add the number of sandwiches made in the morning and the number made later.

Total sandwiches = Sandwiches made in the morning + Sandwiches made later
Total sandwiches = 12 + 24
Total sandwiches = &lt;&lt;12+24=36&gt;&gt;36

Therefore, the sandwich shop made a total of 36 tuna sandwiches in the day.

### Answer: 36</pre>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue with the problem. We know that:
- The sandwich shop made a total of 36 tuna sandwiches in the day.
- They sold 29 of the tuna sandwiches later in the day.

To find out how many tuna sandwiches are left, we need to subtract the number of sandwiches sold from the total number of sandwiches made.

Remaining sandwiches = Total sandwiches made - Sandwiches sold
Remaining sandwiches = 36 - 29
Remaining sandwiches = &lt;&lt;36-29=7&gt;&gt;7

So, there are 7 tuna sandwiches left after selling 29 of them.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the updated information:
- In the morning, the sandwich shop makes 4 tuna sandwiches (instead of 12).
- Later, they make an additional 24 tuna sandwiches.

To find the total number of tuna sandwiches made in the day, we need to add the number of sandwiches made in the morning and the number made later.

Total sandwiches = Sandwiches made in the morning + Sandwiches made later
Total sandwiches = 4 + 24
Total sandwiches = &lt;&lt;4+24=28&gt;&gt;28

Therefore, with the updated information, the sandwich shop made a total of 28 tuna sandwiches in the day.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of people &quot;Rocket Punch&quot; saved in one day, we need to add the number of lives he saved from the fire disaster and the collapsing building.

Given:
- &quot;Rocket Punch&quot; saved 53 lives from a fire disaster.
- He also saved 42 lives from a collapsing building later in the day.

Step 1: Add the number of lives saved from the fire disaster and the collapsing building.
Total lives saved = Lives saved from fire disaster + Lives saved from collapsing building
Total lives saved = 53 + 42 = &lt;&lt;53+42=95&gt;&gt;95

Given:
- &quot;Rocket Punch&quot; saved 53 lives from a fire disaster.
- He also saved 42 lives from a collapsing building later in the day.
- Initially, there were 97 people in danger.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of people &quot;Rocket Punch&quot; saved in one day.
Total lives saved = Lives saved from fire disaster + Lives saved from collapsing building
Total lives saved = 53 + 42 = &lt;&lt;53+42=95&gt;&gt;95

Step 2: Calculate the number of people still in danger by subtracting the total lives saved from the initial number of people in danger.
People still in danger = Initial people in danger - Total lives saved
People still in danger = 97 - 95 = &lt;&lt;97-95=2&gt;&gt;2

Therefore, 2 people were still in danger after &quot;Rocket Punch&quot; completed his rescues for the day.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this alternative scenario, we need to calculate the total number of people &quot;Rocket Punch&quot; saved by adding the lives he saved from the fire disaster and the collapsing building.

Given:
- &quot;Rocket Punch&quot; saved 53 lives from a fire disaster.
- In this scenario, he saved 33 lives from a collapsing building later in the day.

Step 1: Add the number of lives saved from the fire disaster and the collapsing building.
Total lives saved = Lives saved from fire disaster + Lives saved from collapsing building
Total lives saved = 53 + 33 = &lt;&lt;53+33=86&gt;&gt;86

Therefore, in this alternative scenario, &quot;Rocket Punch&quot; saved a total of 86 people in one day.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Harry rides his skateboard forward 76 meters.
2. Then, he rides back 66 meters.
3. To find out how far Harry is from his starting point, we need to subtract the distance he rode back from the distance he rode forward.

Distance from starting point = Forward distance - Backward distance
Distance from starting point = 76 meters - 66 meters
Distance from starting point = 76 - 66 = &lt;&lt;76-66=10&gt;&gt;10 meters

Therefore, Harry is 10 meters away from his starting point.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the new information.

Given:
- Harry initially rides his skateboard 76 meters forward.
- He then decides to ride it back 52 meters.

To find out how far Harry is from his starting point, we need to subtract the distance he rode back from the distance he rode forward.

Distance from starting point = Forward distance - Backward distance
Distance from starting point = 76 meters - 52 meters
Distance from starting point = 76 - 52 = &lt;&lt;76-52=24&gt;&gt;24 meters

In this case, Harry would be 24 meters away from his starting point.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The store started the day with 87 shirts.
   * During the day, they sold 26 shirts.

Given:
- The store started the day with 87 shirts.
- During the day, they sold 32 shirts (instead of 26).

Step 1: Calculate the number of shirts left by subtracting the number of shirts sold from the initial stock.
Shirts left = Initial stock - Shirts sold
Shirts left = 87 - 32
Shirts left = 55

Therefore, if the store initially had 87 shirts and sold 32 shirts during the day, they would have 55 shirts left at the end of the day.

Initial length = 30 feet

Step 2: Identify the extra length added to the rope.
Extra length = 1 foot

Step 3: Calculate the new length of the rope by adding the initial length and the extra length.
New length = Initial length + Extra length
New length = 30 feet + 1 foot

* On Tuesday, the shop rented out 18 pairs of roller skates.
* On Wednesday, the shop rented out 23 pairs of roller skates.

To find the total number of roller skates rented out over these two days, we need to add the number of pairs rented on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Total pairs of roller skates rented = Pairs rented on Tuesday + Pairs rented on Wednesday
Total pairs of roller skates rented = 18 + 23
Total pairs of roller skates rented = &lt;&lt;18+23=41&gt;&gt;41

Since each pair consists of 2 roller skates, we need to multiply the total pairs by 2 to get the total number of roller skates.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's organize the information we have:
* A regular rainbow has 42 visible colors.
* The special rainbow has all the colors of a regular rainbow, plus an additional 6 colors that are not usually visible.

To find the total number of colors in the special rainbow, we need to:
1. Count the number of colors in a regular rainbow
2. Add the additional colors that are not usually visible

Step 1: Number of colors in a regular rainbow = 42

Step 2: Additional colors in the special rainbow = 6

Total colors in the special rainbow = Colors in a regular rainbow + Additional colors
* Total colors = 42 + 6
* Total colors = 48

Therefore, the special rainbow has 48 colors.

        After the special rainbow disappears, another forms in its place. This one has a total of 78 colors. Taking into account the number of colors in the special rainbow, how many new colors does this rainbow have that the special rainbow did not?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We know that:
* The special rainbow had 48 colors.
* The new rainbow that formed in its place has 78 colors.

To find out how many new colors this rainbow has that the special rainbow did not, we need to:
1. Find the difference between the total colors in the new rainbow and the special rainbow.

Step 1: Difference in colors = Total colors in the new rainbow - Total colors in the special rainbow
* Difference in colors = 78 - 48
* Difference in colors = 30

Therefore, the new rainbow has 30 colors that the special rainbow did not have.

Initial number of drummers = 25
New drummers who joined = 32

Total number of drummers = Initial number of drummers + New drummers who joined
Total number of drummers = 25 + 32 = 57

Given:
- There were 37 guitars left after the first half of the event.
- An additional 47 guitars were brought out to sell after the first half.

To find the total number of guitars available to sell in the second half of the event, we need to add the number of guitars left after the first half to the number of additional guitars brought out.

Step 1: Add the number of guitars left after the first half to the additional guitars brought out.
Total guitars in the second half = Guitars left after the first half + Additional guitars brought out
Total guitars in the second half = 37 + 47
Total guitars in the second half = &lt;&lt;37+47=84&gt;&gt;84

Additional potatoes needed = Amount needed for last order - Amount initially harvested
Additional potatoes needed = 78 kg - 69 kg

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* The toy shop initially had 19 Elsa dolls in stock.
* They received a new shipment of 56 Elsa dolls.

To find the total number of Elsa dolls the toy shop has now, we need to add the number of dolls they had initially to the number of dolls they received in the new shipment.

Initial number of Elsa dolls: 19
Number of Elsa dolls in the new shipment: 56

Total number of Elsa dolls = Initial number + Number in the new shipment
Total number of Elsa dolls = 19 + 56 = &lt;&lt;19+56=75&gt;&gt;75

Therefore, the toy shop now has a total of 75 Elsa dolls in stock.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* The toy shop had a total of 75 Elsa dolls in stock.
* They put 66 Elsa dolls on a 50% discount sale.
* All 66 discounted Elsa dolls sold out in a day.

To find the number of Elsa dolls the toy shop has left, we need to subtract the number of dolls sold from the total number of dolls they had in stock.

Total number of Elsa dolls: 75
Number of Elsa dolls sold: 66

Number of Elsa dolls left = Total number - Number sold
Number of Elsa dolls left = 75 - 66 = &lt;&lt;75-66=9&gt;&gt;9

Therefore, the toy shop now has 9 Elsa dolls left in stock.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the information provided to find the total number of Elsa dolls the toy shop has now.

Given:
* The toy shop initially had 19 Elsa dolls in stock.
* They received a new shipment of 73 Elsa dolls.

To calculate the total number of Elsa dolls, we need to add the initial number of dolls to the number of dolls received in the new shipment.

Initial number of Elsa dolls: 19
Number of Elsa dolls in the new shipment: 73

Total number of Elsa dolls = Initial number + Number in the new shipment
Total number of Elsa dolls = 19 + 73 = &lt;&lt;19+73=92&gt;&gt;92

So, after receiving the new shipment, the toy shop now has a total of 92 Elsa dolls in their inventory.

* In the first hour, the factory produces 71 candies.
* In the next hour (second hour), they produce an additional 21 candies.
* We need to find the total number of candies produced in these two hours.

Now, let's calculate:
* Total candies = Candies produced in the first hour + Candies produced in the second hour
* Total candies = 71 + 21
* Total candies = 92

Therefore, the factory produced a total of 92 candies over the two hours.

* In the first hour, the factory produces 71 candies.
* In the next hour (second hour), they produce an additional 21 candies.
* However, 63 candies are found to be defective and are removed from the batch.
* We need to find the number of candies left after removing the defective ones.

Now, let's calculate:
1. Total candies produced = Candies produced in the first hour + Candies produced in the second hour
   * Total candies produced = 71 + 21 = 92

2. Remaining candies = Total candies produced - Defective candies
   * Remaining candies = 92 - 63 = 29

Therefore, after removing the defective candies, there are 29 candies left.

* In the first hour, the factory actually produced 47 candies (not 71 as originally thought).
* In the next hour (second hour), they produce an additional 21 candies.
* We need to find the total number of candies produced in these two hours.

Now, let's recalculate:
* Total candies = Candies produced in the first hour + Candies produced in the second hour
* Total candies = 47 + 21
* Total candies = 68

Therefore, given the revised count for the first hour, the factory produced a total of 68 candies over the two hours.

Step 1: The rival robot dispenser sold the same number of robots as the robot factory.
Rival robot dispenser's sales = Robot factory's sales = 68

Step 2: Calculate the total number of robots sold by both stores.
Total robots sold = Robot factory's sales + Rival robot dispenser's sales

        In the original scenario, suppose that the janitor had actually lost 34 keys throughout the year instead of 74. How many keys would he have had left at the end of the year in that case?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given:
- The janitor starts the year with 87 keys.
- He loses 34 keys throughout the year (instead of 74).

To find the number of keys the janitor has left at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of keys he lost from the number of keys he started with:

Keys left = Initial number of keys - Keys lost
Keys left = 87 - 34
Keys left = &lt;&lt;87-34=53&gt;&gt;53

Therefore, if the janitor had lost 34 keys throughout the year, he would have had 53 keys left at the end of the year.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Sarah initially had 51 pillows in her store.
* After selling some pillows, she is left with 2 pillows.

To find out how many pillows Sarah sold, we need to subtract the number of pillows she has left from the initial number of pillows.

Initial number of pillows = 51
Number of pillows left = 2

Number of pillows sold = Initial number of pillows - Number of pillows left
Number of pillows sold = 51 - 2 = &lt;&lt;51-2=49&gt;&gt;49

Therefore, Sarah sold 49 pillows.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information based on Sarah's discovery:
* Sarah initially had 64 pillows in her store, not 51.
* After selling some pillows, she is left with 2 pillows.

To find out how many pillows Sarah sold, we need to subtract the number of pillows she has left from the updated initial number of pillows.

Updated initial number of pillows = 64
Number of pillows left = 2

Number of pillows sold = Updated initial number of pillows - Number of pillows left
Number of pillows sold = 64 - 2 = &lt;&lt;64-2=62&gt;&gt;62

Therefore, with the updated information, Sarah sold 62 pillows.

To find the total number of lamps in Steve's collection after receiving the gift, we need to add the number of lamps he already had to the number of lamps he received as a gift.

Total lamps after the gift = Lamps in the collection + Gifted lamps

Now, to find out how many more oranges the farmer needs, we subtract the total oranges collected from the target number of oranges:
* Additional oranges needed = Target number of oranges - Total oranges collected
* Additional oranges needed = 81 - 47

        On Tuesday, a group of researchers spotted 42 sharks near an island. On Wednesday, they spotted an additional 26 sharks around the same place. On Thursday, they spotted 32 more in the nearby waters, using a different technology. 

Sometime later, the same group of researchers reports that 59 of their earlier recorded numbers of sharks have migrated elsewhere. After considering this, how many sharks are now left in the area according to their accounting?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the updated information:
* Initially, 42 + 26 + 32 = 100 sharks were spotted in total.
* Later, 59 of the earlier recorded sharks migrated elsewhere.

To find the number of sharks left in the area, we need to subtract the number of sharks that migrated from the total number of sharks initially spotted.

Sharks left in the area = Total sharks initially spotted - Sharks that migrated
* Total sharks initially spotted = 100
* Sharks that migrated = 59

Sharks left in the area = 100 - 59
                         = 41

        Previously, on Tuesday and Wednesday, a group of researchers spotted a total of 68 sharks near an island, and on Thursday, they spotted 32 more in the nearby waters. 

But now suppose that on Thursday, instead of spotting 32 more sharks, they had only spotted 15 more. How many sharks would they have reported then?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information based on the new scenario:
* On Tuesday and Wednesday combined, 68 sharks were spotted.
* On Thursday, 15 more sharks were spotted (instead of 32).

To find the total number of sharks spotted in this new scenario, we need to add the number of sharks spotted on Tuesday and Wednesday to the new number of sharks spotted on Thursday.

Total sharks spotted = Sharks spotted on Tuesday and Wednesday + Sharks spotted on Thursday
* Sharks spotted on Tuesday and Wednesday = 68
* Sharks spotted on Thursday = 15

Total sharks spotted = 68 + 15

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There were 61 turkey sandwiches at the start of the picnic.
   * 2 of these turkey sandwiches were eaten.

2. To find the number of sandwiches left over, we need to subtract the number of eaten sandwiches from the initial number of sandwiches:
   * Sandwiches left over = Initial number of sandwiches - Eaten sandwiches
   * Sandwiches left over = 61 - 2
   * Sandwiches left over = 59

Therefore, there were 59 sandwiches left over at the picnic.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's continue from where we left off in the previous problem. We know that after the first 2 sandwiches were eaten, there were 59 sandwiches left over. Now, we need to consider the additional 31 sandwiches eaten during the late lunch.

Given:
- There were 59 sandwiches left over after the first 2 were eaten.
- Another 31 sandwiches were eaten during the late lunch.

To find the number of sandwiches left over after the late lunch, we need to subtract the number of sandwiches eaten during the late lunch from the number of sandwiches left over after the first 2 were eaten.

Sandwiches left over after late lunch = Sandwiches left over after first 2 eaten - Sandwiches eaten during late lunch
Sandwiches left over after late lunch = 59 - 31
Sandwiches left over after late lunch = 28

Therefore, there were 28 sandwiches left over after the late lunch.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem using the same approach as before, but with the updated information.

Given:
- There were 54 turkey sandwiches at the start of the picnic.
- 2 of these turkey sandwiches were eaten.

Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches left over by subtracting the number of eaten sandwiches from the initial number of sandwiches.

Sandwiches left over = Initial number of sandwiches - Eaten sandwiches
Sandwiches left over = 54 - 2
Sandwiches left over = 52

Therefore, if there were originally 54 turkey sandwiches and 2 were eaten, there would be 52 sandwiches left over at the picnic.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Initially, Rob has 11 guitar picks.
2. He loses 2 of them, so now he has:
   * Remaining picks = 11 - 2 = 9 picks

3. The next day, he buys 75 more picks. So, the total number of picks he has now is:
   * Total picks = Remaining picks + Bought picks
   * Total picks = 9 + 75 = 84 picks

Therefore, Rob now has 84 guitar picks.

Given:
- Timmy had 74 goes on the slide before his break.
- Timmy had 51 goes on the slide after his break.

Calculation:
Number of times fewer = Number of goes before break - Number of goes after break
Number of times fewer = 74 - 51 = 23

Therefore, Timmy went on the slide 23 fewer times after his break compared to before his break.

Given:
- In the original situation, Timmy went on the slide 74 times before his break.
- In the new situation, Timmy went on the slide 15 times before his break.

Calculation:
Number of times fewer = Original number of goes before break - New number of goes before break
Number of times fewer = 74 - 15 = 59

1. We know that there are 73 worker bees in the hive initially.
2. 33 of these worker bees leave the hive to collect pollen.
3. To find the number of worker bees left in the hive, we need to subtract the number of bees that left from the total number of bees.

So, the number of worker bees left in the hive is:
73 - 33 = &lt;&lt;73-33=40&gt;&gt;40

Therefore, after 33 worker bees leave to gather pollen, there are 40 worker bees left in the hive.

3. To find the number of worker bees left in the hive, we need to subtract the number of bees that left from the total number of bees.

So, the number of worker bees left in the hive is:
73 - 57 = &lt;&lt;73-57=16&gt;&gt;16

Therefore, after 57 worker bees leave to gather pollen, there are 16 worker bees left in the hive.

* The company produced 86 helicopters this year.
* They had to recall 34 helicopters due to a defect.

To find out how many helicopters are left in their inventory, we need to subtract the number of recalled helicopters from the total number of helicopters produced.

Helicopters left in inventory = Total helicopters produced - Recalled helicopters
Helicopters left in inventory = 86 - 34 = 52

To find the total number of computers in stock now, we need to add the number of newly discovered computers to the previous total.

Previous total computers in stock: 94
Newly discovered computers: 2

Updated total computers in stock = Previous total computers in stock + Newly discovered computers
Updated total computers in stock = 94 + 2 = 96

To find the total number of computers in stock after the new shipment, we need to add the number of computers in the new shipment to the actual initial number of computers in stock.

Actual initial computers in stock: 61
Computers in the new shipment: 5

Total computers in stock = Actual initial computers in stock + Computers in the new shipment
Total computers in stock = 61 + 5 = 66

Step 2: Subtract the total amount of water from the tank's capacity.
* Remaining capacity = Tank's capacity - Total water after addition
* Remaining capacity = 80 gallons - 59 gallons = &lt;&lt;80-59=21&gt;&gt;21 gallons

Therefore, with the updated tank capacity of 80 gallons, the water tank can hold 21 more gallons of water before it is full.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* In the first area of the ocean, 52 starfish were found.
* In another area, 42 more starfish were found.

To find the total number of starfish found during the exploration, we need to add the number of starfish found in both areas.

Total starfish = Starfish in first area + Starfish in second area
Total starfish = 52 + 42
Total starfish = &lt;&lt;52+42=94&gt;&gt;94

Therefore, during the underwater exploration, a total of 94 starfish were found.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* During the underwater exploration, a total of 94 starfish were found and saved.
* After the tempest, 95 starfish were washed ashore and need to be rescued.

To determine how many more starfish need to be rescued from the shore to have saved an equal number from both places, we need to find the difference between the number of starfish washed ashore and the number of starfish saved from the ocean.

Additional starfish to rescue = Starfish washed ashore - Starfish saved from the ocean
Additional starfish to rescue = 95 - 94
Additional starfish to rescue = &lt;&lt;95-94=1&gt;&gt;1

So, they need to rescue 1 more starfish from the shore to have saved an equal number of starfish from both the ocean and the shore.

* In another area, 42 more starfish were found.

To find the updated total number of starfish found during the exploration, we need to add the number of starfish found in both areas.

Updated total starfish = Starfish in first area + Starfish in second area
Updated total starfish = 25 + 42
Updated total starfish = &lt;&lt;25+42=67&gt;&gt;67

Therefore, given the change in the count of the first area, a total of 67 starfish were found during the underwater exploration.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The transport company initially had 65 trucks.
   * Some trucks broke down.
   * After the breakdown, they have 31 trucks left.

2. To find the number of trucks that broke down, we need to subtract the number of trucks left from the initial number of trucks:
   * Number of trucks that broke down = Initial number of trucks - Number of trucks left
   * Number of trucks that broke down = 65 - 31
   * Number of trucks that broke down = 34

Given:
- The transport company initially had 65 trucks.
- After some trucks broke down, 55 trucks were still functional.

To find the number of trucks that broke down, we need to subtract the number of functional trucks from the initial number of trucks.

Number of trucks that broke down = Initial number of trucks - Number of functional trucks
Number of trucks that broke down = 65 - 55
Number of trucks that broke down = 10

Therefore, in this case, 10 trucks would have broken down.

        Danny got a new sleeping bag for his camping trip. The temperature inside the tent was 13 degrees Celsius. He added a heater which increased the temperature by 45 degrees Celsius. Later on, he added another heating device which increased the temperature by an additional 4 degrees Celsius. What was the final temperature inside the tent after using both heating devices?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The initial temperature inside the tent was 13 degrees Celsius.
   * Danny used a heater which increased the temperature by 45 degrees Celsius.
   * Later, he added another heating device which increased the temperature by an additional 4 degrees Celsius.

2. Find the temperature after using the first heater:
   * Temperature after first heater = Initial temperature + Increase in temperature from first heater
   * Temperature after first heater = 13°C + 45°C
   * Temperature after first heater = 58°C

3. Find the final temperature after using the second heating device:
   * Final temperature = Temperature after first heater + Increase in temperature from second heating device
   * Final temperature = 58°C + 4°C
   * Final temperature = 62°C

Therefore, the final temperature inside the tent after using both heating devices was 62 degrees Celsius.

        In the previous scenario, Danny added a heater to his tent when the initial temperature was 13 degrees Celsius. But let's consider a different situation. Suppose the tent's initial temperature was higher and reached 81 degrees Celsius. If Danny added a heater to the tent that was already 13 degrees Celsius, what would be the final temperature inside the tent?

1. Understand the given information:
   * The initial temperature inside the tent was 81 degrees Celsius.
   * Danny added a heater to the tent, which was already at 13 degrees Celsius.

2. To find the final temperature, we need to add the initial temperature of the tent and the temperature of the heater:
   * Final temperature = Initial temperature of the tent + Temperature of the heater
   * Final temperature = 81°C + 13°C
   * Final temperature = 94°C

Therefore, if the tent's initial temperature was 81 degrees Celsius and Danny added a heater that was already at 13 degrees Celsius, the final temperature inside the tent would be 94 degrees Celsius.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The library currently has 73 books in the fiction section.
   * The total number of books in the fiction section should be 91.

2. To find the number of books the library needs to add, we need to subtract the current number of books from the desired total number of books:
   * Books to add = Desired total number of books - Current number of books
   * Books to add = 91 - 73
   * Books to add = 18

Therefore, the library needs to add 18 more books to the fiction section to reach the desired total of 91 books.

1. Understand the updated information:
   * The library actually has 71 books in the fiction section, not 73 as previously stated.
   * The total number of books in the fiction section should be 91.

2. To find the number of books the library needs to add, we need to subtract the current number of books from the desired total number of books:
   * Books to add = Desired total number of books - Current number of books
   * Books to add = 91 - 71
   * Books to add = 20

Therefore, with the corrected inventory count, the library needs to add 20 more books to the fiction section to reach the desired total of 91 books.

Given:
- There are 36 blue colored pencils at the art store.
- A customer bought one blue colored pencil.

Step 1: Subtract the number of blue pencils the customer bought from the total number of blue pencils.
Blue pencils left = Total blue pencils - Blue pencils bought by the customer

Cans of red paint left = Total cans of red paint - Cans of red paint sold
Cans of red paint left = 54 - 15 = &lt;&lt;54-15=39&gt;&gt;39

Therefore, if the paint store had originally received a shipment of 54 cans of red paint and sold 15 cans, they would have 39 cans of red paint left in the store.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the amount of snowfall from Tuesday and the additional snowfall later in the week.

Given:
- On Tuesday, the town received 49 inches of snow.
- Later the same week, an additional 32 inches of snowfall was recorded.

Step 1: Add the snowfall from Tuesday and the additional snowfall later in the week.
Total snowfall = Tuesday's snowfall + Additional snowfall
Total snowfall = 49 inches + 32 inches
Total snowfall = 49 + 32 = &lt;&lt;49+32=81&gt;&gt;81 inches

Therefore, the total amount of snowfall received by the town within the week is 81 inches.

1. The store initially had 78 king size beds.
2. During the sale, they sold 50 of these beds.
3. To find the number of beds left after the sale, we subtract the number of beds sold from the initial number of beds:
   * Beds left after sale = 78 - 50 = 28

4. However, due to a manufacturing error, the number of beds left was duplicated.

To find the total number of books the librarian would have received:
* Regular books expected in the shipment = 82

We already calculated that after bringing tables from the warehouse, the furniture shop has a total of 89 tables.

Current total tables = 24 + 65 = 89
Target total tables = 91

To find the number of additional tables needed from the overseas collection, we need to subtract the current total tables from the target total tables.

Additional tables needed = Target total tables - Current total tables
Additional tables needed = 91 - 89 = 2

Therefore, the furniture shop needs 2 additional tables from the overseas collection to reach their target of 91 tables on display.

To find the total number of friends Sam is inviting to his party, we need to add the number of neighborhood friends and the number of school friends.

Total friends = Neighborhood friends + School friends
Total friends = 6 + 10
Total friends = 16

Therefore, Sam is inviting a total of 16 friends to his birthday party.

        Sam had some additional thoughts about his guest list for the birthday party.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the updated information we have:
* Sam initially invites 6 of his neighborhood friends to his birthday party.
* He then invites 10 more friends from school.
* Due to space limitations at the party venue, he has to uninvite 4 friends.

To find the updated number of friends Sam is inviting to his party, we need to:
1. Add the number of neighborhood friends and the number of school friends.
2. Subtract the number of uninvited friends from the total.

Step 1: Total friends invited = Neighborhood friends + School friends
Total friends invited = 6 + 10 = 16

Step 2: Updated number of friends = Total friends invited - Uninvited friends
Updated number of friends = 16 - 4 = 12

Therefore, after uninviting 4 friends due to space limitations, Sam now has 12 friends on his party invitation list.

To find the total number of sharks the biologist encountered, we need to add the number of sharks from both areas.

Total sharks = Sharks in the first area + Sharks in the second area
Total sharks = 43 + 27

To find the new total number of beads Jenna has for making necklaces, we need to add the total number of beads she had before and the number of additional beads she purchased.

New total beads = Previous total beads + Additional purchased beads
New total beads = 41 + 57
New total beads = &lt;&lt;41+57=98&gt;&gt;98

Total beads = Initial beads + Purchased beads
Total beads = 65 + 5
Total beads = &lt;&lt;65+5=70&gt;&gt;70

2. Add the tickets sold on Monday and Tuesday.

Step 1: Tickets sold on Tuesday

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The craft store initially had 54 cans of red paint in stock.
* They received a new shipment containing 31 cans of red paint.

To find the total number of cans of red paint the craft store has now, we need to add the number of cans they had initially to the number of cans they received in the new shipment.

Total cans of red paint = Initial cans of red paint + New shipment of red paint
Total cans of red paint = 54 + 31
Total cans of red paint = &lt;&lt;54+31=85&gt;&gt;85

Therefore, the craft store now has a total of 85 cans of red paint.

        In the craft store with the 54 original cans of red paint plus the additional 31 cans from the shipment, 14 cans were sold today. After this sale, how many cans of red paint does the craft store now have left?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the information from the previous problem and the new information provided.

Given:
* The craft store had 54 cans of red paint initially.
* They received a new shipment of 31 cans of red paint.
* The total number of cans after the shipment was 54 + 31 = 85 cans.
* Today, 14 cans of red paint were sold.

To find the number of cans of red paint the craft store has left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of cans sold from the total number of cans they had before the sale.

Cans of red paint left = Total cans before the sale - Cans sold
Cans of red paint left = 85 - 14
Cans of red paint left = &lt;&lt;85-14=71&gt;&gt;71

So, the craft store now has 71 cans of red paint left after selling 14 cans today.

        In our previous problem, the craft store had an initial stock of 54 cans of red paint and received a shipment of an additional 31 cans. Now, imagine if they initially had 54 cans of paint and then received a smaller shipment containing only 4 cans of red paint. How many cans of red paint would the craft store now have in the new scenario?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this new scenario using the same approach as before.

Given information:
* The craft store initially had 54 cans of red paint in stock.
* In this new scenario, they received a smaller shipment containing only 4 cans of red paint.

To find the total number of cans of red paint the craft store has now, we need to add the number of cans they had initially to the number of cans they received in the smaller shipment.

Total cans of red paint = Initial cans of red paint + Smaller shipment of red paint
Total cans of red paint = 54 + 4
Total cans of red paint = &lt;&lt;54+4=58&gt;&gt;58

Therefore, in this new scenario, the craft store would have a total of 58 cans of red paint.

To find the total number of models the store has now, we need to add the initial number of models and the additional models received.

Initial models: 80
Additional models received: 7

Total models = Initial models + Additional models

* The store had 87 models of the latest smartphone at the beginning of the day.
* They sold 21 models by the end of the day.

To find out how many models the store has left after the sales, we need to subtract the number of models sold from the initial number of models.

Initial models: 87
Models sold: 21

Models left = Initial models - Models sold
Models left = 87 - 21 = &lt;&lt;87-21=66&gt;&gt;66

So, the store has 66 models of that smartphone left after the sales.

To find the total number of models the store has now, we need to add the initial number of models and the additional models received.

Initial models: 17
Additional models received: 7

Total models = Initial models + Additional models
Total models = 17 + 7 = &lt;&lt;17+7=24&gt;&gt;24

Therefore, in this new scenario, the store now has a total of 24 models of that smartphone.

- Jake's sister blew 72 bubbles, and none of them popped.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bubbles by adding Jake's remaining bubbles and his sister's bubbles.
Total bubbles = Jake's remaining bubbles + Sister's bubbles
Total bubbles = 11 + 72
Total bubbles = &lt;&lt;11+72=83&gt;&gt;83

Therefore, there are 83 bubbles in total, combining Jake's remaining bubbles and the bubbles his sister blew.

2. To find the number of bubbles that remained, we need to subtract the number of popped bubbles from the total number of bubbles blown:
   * Remaining bubbles = Total bubbles - Popped bubbles
   * Remaining bubbles = 73 - 64

Additional toothbrushes = Initial toothbrushes = 15

Step 2: Calculate the total number of toothbrushes in Peter's store after the delivery.
Total toothbrushes = Initial toothbrushes + Additional toothbrushes
Total toothbrushes = 15 + 15 = 30

Therefore, after the morning's delivery, Peter now has 30 toothbrushes in his store.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The farmer harvested a total of 74 cucumbers.
   * 23 of the harvested cucumbers were not good to sell.

2. To find the number of cucumbers fit for sale, we need to subtract the number of cucumbers not good to sell from the total number of harvested cucumbers.

3. Calculation:
   * Cucumbers fit for sale = Total harvested cucumbers - Cucumbers not good to sell
   * Cucumbers fit for sale = 74 - 23
   * Cucumbers fit for sale = 51

Therefore, the farmer has 51 cucumbers left that are fit for sale.

   * The farmer initially harvested a total of 74 cucumbers.
   * 23 of the initially harvested cucumbers were not good to sell.
   * On the next day, the farmer picked an additional 21 cucumbers that are good to sell.

2. Find the number of cucumbers fit for sale from the initial harvest:
   * Initial cucumbers fit for sale = Total harvested cucumbers - Cucumbers not good to sell
   * Initial cucumbers fit for sale = 74 - 23
   * Initial cucumbers fit for sale = 51

3. Add the additional cucumbers picked on the next day to the initial cucumbers fit for sale:
   * Total cucumbers fit for sale = Initial cucumbers fit for sale + Additional cucumbers picked

To find the number of unclaimed pizzas, we need to subtract the total number of ordered pizzas from the total number of prepared pizzas.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ordered pizzas.
Total ordered pizzas = Margherita pizzas + Pepperoni pizzas
Total ordered pizzas = 25 + 29 = &lt;&lt;25+29=54&gt;&gt;54

Step 2: Calculate the number of unclaimed pizzas by subtracting the total ordered pizzas from the total prepared pizzas.

1. We know that the larger number is 88.
2. The difference between the larger number and the missing number is 78.
3. To find the missing number, we need to subtract the difference from the larger number.

Larger number - Difference = Missing number
88 - 78 = Missing number
&lt;&lt;88-78=10&gt;&gt;10 = Missing number

Therefore, the missing number is 10.

3. Now, we need to add the missing number (10) to the difference (78).

Missing number + Difference = New total
10 + 78 = New total

To find the difference between the larger number and the missing number, we need to subtract the missing number from the larger number.

Difference = Larger number - Missing number
Difference = 88 - 61

To find out how many more games John needs to reach his new goal, we need to subtract the number of games he currently has from his goal number of games.

Current games: 57
Goal games: 88
Additional games needed = Goal games - Current games
Additional games needed = 88 - 57 = &lt;&lt;88-57=31&gt;&gt;31

Initial games: 49
Birthday gift games: 11
Total games = Initial games + Birthday gift games

Coins after receiving from Sparrow: 83
Additional coins from another crew member: 9
Total coins = Coins after receiving from Sparrow + Additional coins from another crew member

Initial coins: 1
Actual additional coins from Sparrow: 79
Total coins = Initial coins + Actual additional coins

        Instead of receiving a shipment of 100 cans of paint, the store initially received 88 cans. If they still sold 53 cans, how many cans of paint would they have left?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information:

1. The paint store initially received 88 cans of paint.
2. They sold 53 cans of paint.
3. To find the number of cans left, we need to subtract the number of cans sold from the initial number of cans.

Cans left = Initial number of cans - Number of cans sold
Cans left = 88 - 53
Cans left = 35

Therefore, if the paint store initially received 88 cans and sold 53 cans, they would have 35 cans of paint left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* Rangers have spotted 42 brown bears this year.
* In the same time, they have spotted an additional 54 grizzly bears.

To find the total number of bears spotted, we need to add the number of brown bears and grizzly bears together.

Total bears spotted = Number of brown bears + Number of grizzly bears
Total bears spotted = 42 + 54
Total bears spotted = &lt;&lt;42+54=96&gt;&gt;96

Therefore, the rangers have spotted a total of 96 bears in Yellowstone National Park this year.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's update our information based on the revised count:
* Rangers have spotted 27 brown bears this year (revised from 42).
* They have spotted 54 grizzly bears (unchanged).

Now, let's calculate the total number of bears spotted with the updated information:

Total bears spotted = Number of brown bears (revised) + Number of grizzly bears
Total bears spotted = 27 + 54
Total bears spotted = &lt;&lt;27+54=81&gt;&gt;81

With the revised count of brown bears, the rangers have now spotted a total of 81 bears in Yellowstone National Park this year.

2. Add the number of scooters he bought from the scooter show.

Step 1: Calculate the number of scooters after selling:
Scooters after selling = Initial scooters - Sold scooters
Scooters after selling = 85 - 46 = &lt;&lt;85-46=39&gt;&gt;39

Step 2: Calculate the total number of scooters after buying more:
Total scooters = Scooters after selling + Bought scooters

        After realizing the little prank his sister pulled on him, Ben sets off to retrieve his notes. He manages to find and get back some of his notes. After checking his collection, he realises that he now has just as many notes as he initially did minus the ones he has remaining after his sister's prank. How many notes did Ben manage to retrieve from his sister?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the information from the previous problem and the new information provided.

Given:
- Initially, Ben had 54 secret notes.
- His sister took away 24 notes as a prank.
- After the prank, Ben had 30 notes left.
- Ben retrieved some notes from his sister.
- Now, Ben has as many notes as he initially did minus the ones he has remaining after his sister's prank.

Let's find the number of notes Ben managed to retrieve from his sister.

1. Calculate the number of notes Ben has now:
   * Notes now = Initial notes - Notes remaining after the prank
   * Notes now = 54 - 30
   * Notes now = 24

2. Calculate the number of notes Ben retrieved from his sister:
   * Retrieved notes = Notes now - Notes remaining after the prank
   * Retrieved notes = 24 - 30
   * Retrieved notes = -6

However, it's impossible to retrieve a negative number of notes. This means that the situation described in the problem is not possible with the given information.

### Answer: The situation described is not possible with the given information.</pre>

        Let's rewind and imagine a different scenario. This time, Ben initially had 30 secret notes from his school friends instead of 54. His little sister still took away 24 notes as a joke. In this situation, how many notes does Ben have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this new scenario step by step:

1. Understand the new given information:
   * Ben initially had 30 secret notes from his school friends.
   * His little sister still took away 24 notes as a joke.

2. To find out how many notes Ben has left, we need to subtract the number of notes his sister took from the total number of notes he had:
   * Notes left = Total notes - Notes taken by his sister
   * Notes left = 30 - 24
   * Notes left = 6

Therefore, in this new scenario where Ben initially had 30 secret notes, he has 6 secret notes left after his little sister took away 24 notes.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
* Initially, the store had 28 teddy bears.
* They received a shipment of 10 more teddy bears later that day.
* The following day, they received another shipment of 49 teddy bears.

To find the total number of teddy bears in the store after receiving all the shipments, we need to add the number of teddy bears from each shipment to the initial number of teddy bears in the store.

Initial teddy bears: 28
First shipment: 10
Second shipment: 49

Total teddy bears = Initial + First shipment + Second shipment
Total teddy bears = 28 + 10 + 49
Total teddy bears = &lt;&lt;28+10+49=87&gt;&gt;87

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. We know from the previous question that the store had 87 teddy bears in total after receiving all the shipments.

Given:
- The store had 87 teddy bears before the donation.
- They donated 31 teddy bears to a local children's hospital.

To find out how many teddy bears are left in the store after the donation, we need to subtract the number of donated teddy bears from the total number of teddy bears before the donation.

Teddy bears left = Total teddy bears before donation - Donated teddy bears
Teddy bears left = 87 - 31
Teddy bears left = &lt;&lt;87-31=56&gt;&gt;56

Therefore, the store has 56 teddy bears left after donating 31 teddy bears to the local children's hospital.

* Initially, the store had only 1 teddy bear (not 28 as previously stated).
* They received a shipment of 10 more teddy bears later that day.
* The following day, they received another shipment of 49 teddy bears.

To find the total number of teddy bears in the store after correcting the initial inventory error and receiving all the shipments, we need to add the number of teddy bears from each shipment to the corrected initial number of teddy bears in the store.

Corrected initial teddy bears: 1
First shipment: 10
Second shipment: 49

Total teddy bears = Corrected initial + First shipment + Second shipment
Total teddy bears = 1 + 10 + 49
Total teddy bears = &lt;&lt;1+10+49=60&gt;&gt;60

To find out how much money Rose has now, we need to add the money she already had to the money her dad gave her.

Money Rose has now = Money in her wallet + Money her dad gave her
Money Rose has now = $12 + $81
Money Rose has now = $93
