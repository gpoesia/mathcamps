        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's approach this step by step:

1) We start with the number 13.
2) We need to reach the number 14.
3) To get from 13 to 14, we need to add a certain number.
4) The number we need to add is the difference between 14 and 13.
5) We can find this by subtracting 13 from 14:

   14 - 13 = 1

Therefore, the number that must be added to 13 to reach 14 is 1.

1. Understand the given information:
   * The car rental company had 17 cars available in the morning.
   * By the end of the day, they had 4 cars left.

2. To find the number of cars rented out during the day, we need to subtract the number of cars left at the end of the day from the number of cars available in the morning.

3. Number of cars rented out = Cars available in the morning - Cars left at the end of the day
   * Number of cars rented out = 17 - 4

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's organize the information we have:
- The collector caught 13 butterflies in the morning.
- At the end of the day, there were only 6 butterflies in his collection.

To find out how many butterflies flew away, we need to subtract the number of butterflies remaining from the number of butterflies caught.

Number of butterflies that flew away = Number of butterflies caught - Number of butterflies remaining
Number of butterflies that flew away = 13 - 6 = &lt;&lt;13-6=7&gt;&gt;7

Therefore, 7 butterflies flew away during the day.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Anne bought 15 new pairs of socks.
   * After buying the new socks, she has a total of 20 pairs.

2. To find the number of pairs Anne originally had, we need to subtract the number of new pairs from the total pairs she has now.

3. Calculate the original number of pairs:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The superhero's base strength level is 1 unit.
   * With the super strength amulet, the superhero's strength level becomes 12 units.

2. To find the extra strength units provided by the amulet, we need to subtract the base strength level from the total strength level with the amulet:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many swings were damaged, we need to subtract the number of undamaged swings from the original number of swings.

Given:
- Originally, there were 19 swings.
- After some use, there were 14 swings left undamaged.

Number of damaged swings = Original number of swings - Number of undamaged swings
Number of damaged swings = 19 - 14 = 5

Therefore, 5 swings were damaged.

* The factory has already produced 5 bottles this morning.
* The daily goal is to produce 12 bottles.

To find out how many more bottles need to be produced, we can subtract the number of bottles already produced from the daily goal.

Number of bottles needed = Daily goal - Bottles already produced
Number of bottles needed = 12 - 5 = &lt;&lt;12-5=7&gt;&gt;7

Therefore, the factory needs to produce 7 more bottles to reach their daily goal.

2. To find the original number of people at the party, we need to add the number of people who left to the number of people who remained.
   * Original number of people = People who left + People who remained
   * Original number of people = 3 + 15

3. Calculate the sum:
   * Original number of people = 3 + 15 = 18

Therefore, there were originally 18 people at the party before anyone left.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Lucy starts with 9 letters in her mailbox.
   * By the end of the day, the total number of letters in her mailbox is 19.

2. To find the number of letters Lucy receives during the day, we need to subtract the initial number of letters from the total number of letters at the end of the day.

3. Calculation:
   * Letters received = Total letters at the end of the day - Initial letters

To find out how many more wind turbines were constructed and added to the farm, we need to subtract the number of operational wind turbines from the total number of wind turbines.

Number of additional wind turbines = Total number of wind turbines - Number of operational wind turbines
Number of additional wind turbines = 17 - 15 = 2

Therefore, 2 more wind turbines were constructed and added to the farm.

1. Understand the given information:
   * John started with a certain number of guitar picks.
   * After playing for a while, he has 6 picks left.
   * He lost 1 pick while playing.

2. Set up an equation to represent the problem:
   * Let's say the original number of picks is x.
   * After losing 1 pick, he has 6 picks left.
   * So, we can write the equation: x - 1 = 6

3. Solve the equation to find the original number of picks:
   * Add 1 to both sides of the equation: x - 1 + 1 = 6 + 1
   * Simplify: x = 7

Therefore, John originally started with 7 guitar picks.

* At the beginning of the day, there were 18 fully operational robots.
* By the end of the day, there were only 16 operational robots left.

To find out how many robots stopped functioning during the day, we need to calculate the difference between the number of operational robots at the beginning and end of the day.

Number of robots that stopped functioning = Number of operational robots at the beginning - Number of operational robots at the end
* Number of robots that stopped functioning = 18 - 16
* Number of robots that stopped functioning = 2

Therefore, 2 robots stopped functioning during the day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The circus had a certain number of tigers initially.
   * They sold 3 tigers to a zoo.
   * After selling the tigers, they have 8 tigers left.

2. Let's represent the original number of tigers with a variable, say 'x'.

3. Now, we can write an equation based on the information:
   * Original number of tigers - Tigers sold = Tigers left
   * x - 3 = 8

4. To find the original number of tigers, we need to solve the equation:
   * x - 3 = 8
   * x = 8 + 3
   * x = 11

Therefore, the circus had 11 tigers originally.

3. After stashing away 4 gold coins, the pirate is left with 1 coin. We can represent this as an equation:
   * x - 4 = 1

4. To find the original number of gold coins (x), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:

Therefore, the pirate originally had 5 gold coins before stashing them away.

1. Understand the given information:
   * At the beginning of the day, the desk drawer had 6 pens.
   * At the end of the day, the desk drawer had a total of 12 pens.
   * The increase in the number of pens is due to office workers dropping off pens in the drawer.

2. To find the number of pens dropped off by office workers, we need to calculate the difference between the number of pens at the end of the day and the number of pens at the beginning of the day.

3. Calculate the number of pens dropped off:
   * Pens dropped off = Pens at the end of the day - Pens at the beginning of the day
   * Pens dropped off = 12 - 6
   * Pens dropped off = 6

Therefore, office workers dropped off 6 pens in the drawer throughout the day.

* Initially, the shape enthusiast had 15 different types of shapes.
* After giving some away, she is left with 11 types of shapes.

To find out how many different types of shapes she gave away, we need to subtract the number of types she has now from the number of types she had initially.

Number of types given away = Initial number of types - Current number of types
Number of types given away = 15 - 11 = 4

Therefore, the shape enthusiast gave away 4 different types of shapes.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The hat maker starts the day with an unknown number of wool hats.
   * By noon, he sold 6 hats.
   * After selling the 6 hats, he is left with 9 hats.

2. Let's represent the unknown number of hats he started with as a variable, say 'x'.

3. Now, we can write an equation based on the given information:
   * Initial number of hats - Sold hats = Remaining hats
   * x - 6 = 9

4. To find the initial number of hats, we need to solve the equation:
   * x - 6 = 9
   * x = 9 + 6
   * x = 15

Therefore, the hat maker started the day with 15 wool hats.

1. Understand the given information:
   * You started the day with 18 guitars in stock.
   * After a customer bought some guitars, you have 16 guitars left.

2. To find the number of guitars the customer bought, we need to subtract the remaining guitars from the initial number of guitars:
   * Guitars bought = Initial number of guitars - Remaining guitars
   * Guitars bought = 18 - 16
   * Guitars bought = 2

Therefore, the customer bought 2 guitars.

   * By the end of the day, the shop had a total of 14 mountain bikes.
   * Some new mountain bikes were shipped to the shop during the day.

2. To find the number of new mountain bikes shipped, we need to subtract the initial number of bikes from the total number of bikes at the end of the day.

3. Number of new mountain bikes = Total bikes at the end of the day - Initial bikes
   * Number of new mountain bikes = 14 - 4

   * Number of pencils given by the classmate = Final number of pencils - Initial number of pencils
   * Number of pencils given by the classmate = 3 - 2
   * Number of pencils given by the classmate = 1

Therefore, the classmate gave the child 1 blue colored pencil.

2. To find out how many more tents were set up during the day, we need to subtract the initial number of tents from the total number of tents at the end of the day.

3. Number of tents set up during the day = Total tents at the end of the day - Initial number of tents
   * Number of tents set up during the day = 19 - 15

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, let's organize the given information:
* The band had prepared 11 songs to perform.
* They only managed to perform 7 songs.

To find out how many songs they were not able to perform, we need to subtract the number of songs they performed from the total number of songs they had prepared.

Number of songs not performed = Total songs prepared - Songs performed
Number of songs not performed = 11 - 7 = &lt;&lt;11-7=4&gt;&gt;4

Therefore, the band was not able to perform 4 songs at the concert due to technical problems.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The snowman is made of a certain number of snowballs.
   * If 7 snowballs are removed, 11 snowballs remain.

2. Let's define a variable for the original number of snowballs:
   * Let x be the original number of snowballs.

3. Set up an equation based on the given information:
   * Original number of snowballs - 7 = 11
   * x - 7 = 11

4. Solve the equation:
   * x - 7 = 11
   * x - 7 + 7 = 11 + 7
   * x = 18

Therefore, the snowman was originally built with 18 snowballs.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Initially, there were 10 mermaids in the underwater kingdom.
   * Later, the number of mermaids increased to 20.

2. To find the number of new mermaids that joined the kingdom, we need to subtract the initial number of mermaids from the final number of mermaids:
   * New mermaids = Final number of mermaids - Initial number of mermaids
   * New mermaids = 20 - 10
   * New mermaids = &lt;&lt;20-10=10&gt;&gt;10

Therefore, 10 new mermaids joined the underwater kingdom.
