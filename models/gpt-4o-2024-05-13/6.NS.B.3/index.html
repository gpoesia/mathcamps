        A window cleaning company charges $533.89 for cleaning the windows of a large building, and this cost is equally shared by 20.3 tenants. How much does each tenant contribute to the window cleaning cost?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much each tenant contributes to the window cleaning cost, we need to divide the total cost by the number of tenants.

The total cost is $533.89, and the number of tenants is 20.3.

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{533.89}{20.3} \]

First, let's convert the division into a more manageable form by eliminating the decimal in the divisor. We can multiply both the numerator and the divisor by 10:
\[ \frac{5338.9}{203} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ 5338.9 \div 203 \approx 26.31 \]

Thus, each tenant contributes approximately $26.31 to the window cleaning cost.

        Previously, the window cleaning cost was divided among the tenants based on a total expense of $533.89. However, it turns out there was a mistake in the billing and the cleaning company only charged $21 for the job. With this adjusted cost, how much would each of the 20.3 tenants need to contribute to the window cleaning cost now?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the new contribution per tenant with the adjusted cost, we need to divide the new total cost by the number of tenants.

The new total cost is $21, and the number of tenants is 20.3.

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{21}{20.3} \]

First, let's convert the division into a more manageable form by eliminating the decimal in the divisor. We can multiply both the numerator and the divisor by 10:
\[ \frac{210}{203} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ 210 \div 203 \approx 1.0345 \]

Thus, each tenant would need to contribute approximately $1.03 to the window cleaning cost.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many kilograms of cucumber each store received, we need to divide the total amount of cucumbers by the number of stores.

\[
\text{Total kilograms of cucumber} = 2218.5 \, \text{kg}

\[
\text{Number of stores} = 51
\]

We perform the division:

\[
\frac{2218.5 \, \text{kg}}{51} = 43.5 \, \text{kg}

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many kilograms of cucumber were left at each store after making the salad, we need to subtract the amount used for the salad from the total amount each store received.

Each store received:

Each store used for the salad:
\[
25.3 \, \text{kg}

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of wool needed, we need to multiply the amount of wool used per hat by the number of hats.

Given:
- Wool per hat = 70.2 grams
- Number of hats = 39.2

We perform the multiplication:

First, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Multiply the whole numbers:
\[ 70 \times 39 = 2730 \]

2. Multiply the decimal parts and add the contributions:
\[ 70 \times 0.2 = 14 \]
\[ 0.2 \times 39 = 7.8 \]
\[ 0.2 \times 0.2 = 0.04 \]

Now, add all these parts together:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many grams of wool the hat maker actually used, we need to subtract the amount of wool left from the total amount of wool initially available.

First, let's denote:
- Total wool initially available = \( W \)
- Wool left after making the hats = 87.6 grams

From the previous calculation, we know the total wool needed for 39.2 hats was 2751.84 grams. This means the initial amount of wool \( W \) was 2751.84 grams.

Now, we subtract the wool left from the initial amount:
\[ W - \text{Wool left} = 2751.84 - 87.6 \]

Perform the subtraction:
\[ 2751.84 - 87.6 = 2664.24 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of carbon dioxide that the oak trees can absorb in a year, we need to multiply the number of hectares by the amount of carbon dioxide each hectare can absorb.

Given:
- Number of hectares = 70.3
- Carbon dioxide absorption per hectare = 88.8 tons

We perform the multiplication:
\[ 70.3 \times 88.8 \]

First, let's break it down:
\[ 70.3 \times 88.8 = 70.3 \times (80 + 8.8) \]
\[ = 70.3 \times 80 + 70.3 \times 8.8 \]

Calculate each part:
\[ 70.3 \times 80 = 5624 \]
\[ 70.3 \times 8.8 = 618.64 \]

Now, add the two results together:
\[ 5624 + 618.64 = 6242.64 \]

After the crops had grown, due to an increase in demand, the farm decides to increase their land allocation for crops by a factor of 69.3 times their current allocation. How many acres will the farm dedicate to growing crops after this increase?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total number of acres the farm will dedicate to growing crops after the increase, we first need to find the current total acreage and then multiply it by the factor of 69.3.

1. Calculate the current total acreage:
\[ 41.98 \text{ acres (corn)} + 68.1 \text{ acres (wheat)} \]

Align the decimal points and add:
\[ 
\begin{array}{r}
  41.98 \\

So, the current total acreage is 110.08 acres.

2. Multiply the current total acreage by the factor of 69.3:
\[ 110.08 \times 69.3 \]

To perform this multiplication, we can use the standard algorithm for multiplication:

First, multiply 110.08 by 69.3:
\[ 
\begin{array}{r}
  110.08 \\

\hline

Break it down into simpler steps:
\[ 110.08 \times 69.3 = 110.08 \times (70 - 0.7) \]

Calculate each part separately:
\[ 110.08 \times 70 = 7705.6 \]
\[ 110.08 \times 0.7 = 77.056 \]

Now, subtract the second product from the first:
\[ 7705.6 - 77.056 = 7628.544 \]

Thus, the total acreage after the increase is:

        In the original situation on the farm, there were 41.98 acres of land dedicated to growing corn and another 68.1 acres of land dedicated to growing wheat. Now consider that the farm had originally dedicated 88 acres of land to growing corn, instead of 41.98, while keeping the land for wheat the same. How many acres of land in total would the farm have dedicated to growing crops in this scenario?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of acres dedicated to growing crops in the new scenario, we need to add the updated acres of land dedicated to growing corn and the acres of land dedicated to growing wheat.

First, we have:
- Corn: 88 acres (updated)
- Wheat: 68.1 acres

Now, we add these two amounts together:
\[ 88 + 68.1 \]

To make the addition easier, we can align the decimal points:
\[ 
\begin{array}{r}
  88.0 \\
+ 68.1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Adding the numbers column by column from right to left:
- In the tenths place: \( 0 + 1 = 1 \)
- In the units place: \( 8 + 8 = 16 \) (write down 6 and carry over 1)
- In the tens place: \( 8 + 6 + 1 = 15 \)

\[ \text{Number of skateboards} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Cost per skateboard}} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Number of skateboards} = \frac{5098.56}{56.4} \]

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of chickens in all the coops, we need to multiply the number of chickens per coop by the total number of coops.

Given:
- Number of chickens per coop = 47.33
- Total number of coops = 73.34

We perform the multiplication:
\[ 47.33 \times 73.34 \]

First, let's break it down step-by-step for clarity:

1. Multiply the whole numbers:
\[ 47 \times 73 = 3431 \]

2. Multiply the decimal parts and add the contributions from the whole numbers:
\[ 47.33 \times 73.34 = (47 + 0.33) \times (73 + 0.34) \]
\[ = 47 \times 73 + 47 \times 0.34 + 0.33 \times 73 + 0.33 \times 0.34 \]

Calculating each part:
\[ 47 \times 73 = 3431 \]
\[ 47 \times 0.34 = 15.98 \]
\[ 0.33 \times 73 = 24.09 \]
\[ 0.33 \times 0.34 = 0.1122 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 3431 + 15.98 + 24.09 + 0.1122 = 3471.1822 \]

Therefore, the total number of chickens in all the coops combined is:

The overcounted number of chickens in one coop is:
\[ 41.4 \]

We subtract this from the initial total:
\[ 3471.1822 - 41.4 \]

Performing the subtraction:
\[ 3471.1822 - 41.4 = 3429.7822 \]

        A dragon was on a treasure collecting spree. In one castle, it found a huge pile of gold weighing 51.76 kg. In the next castle, it found an even bigger pile of gold weighing 65.26 kg. How much gold in kilograms did the dragon collect in total from the two castles?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of gold the dragon collected from the two castles, we need to add the weights of the gold from each castle.

First castle: 51.76 kg
Second castle: 65.26 kg

Now, we add these two amounts together:
\[ 51.76 + 65.26 \]

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:

1. Add the hundredths place: \( 6 + 6 = 12 \) (write down 2 and carry over 1)
2. Add the tenths place: \( 7 + 2 = 9 \), plus the carried over 1 makes 10 (write down 0 and carry over 1)
3. Add the units place: \( 1 + 5 = 6 \), plus the carried over 1 makes 7 (write down 7)
4. Add the tens place: \( 5 + 6 = 11 \) (write down 11)

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much gold the dragon has left after giving away 98.5 kg, we need to subtract the amount given away from the total amount collected.

Total gold collected: 117.02 kg
Gold given away: 98.5 kg

Now, we perform the subtraction:
\[ 117.02 - 98.5 \]

To make the subtraction easier, we can rewrite 98.5 as 98.50:
\[ 117.02 - 98.50 \]

Let's perform the subtraction step-by-step:

1. Subtract the hundredths place: \( 2 - 0 = 2 \)
2. Subtract the tenths place: \( 0 - 5 \) (since 0 is less than 5, we need to borrow 1 from the units place, making it 10 - 5 = 5)
3. Subtract the units place: \( 7 - 8 \) (since 7 is less than 8, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place, making it 17 - 8 = 9)
4. Subtract the tens place: \( 10 - 9 = 1 \) (after borrowing 1, the tens place becomes 10)

So, the amount of gold left is:

\[ 16.3 \times 3.4 \]

First, let's break down the multiplication:

        After their day at the beach, the child wants to ship the 3.4 balls to their cousin. The shipping company charges based on the square of the weight in grams. How much would it cost to ship the beach balls if the cost is proportional to the square of the weight?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the shipping cost, we need to first find the total weight of the beach balls and then calculate the square of that weight.

From the previous problem, we know the total weight of the 3.4 beach balls is 55.42 grams.

Next, we calculate the square of the total weight:
\[ (55.42)^2 \]

Let's perform the squaring:
\[ 55.42 \times 55.42 \]

Breaking it down:
\[ 55.42 \times 55.42 = (55 + 0.42) \times (55 + 0.42) \]
\[ = 55 \times 55 + 55 \times 0.42 + 0.42 \times 55 + 0.42 \times 0.42 \]

Calculate each part:
\[ 55 \times 55 = 3025 \]
\[ 55 \times 0.42 = 23.1 \]
\[ 0.42 \times 55 = 23.1 \]
\[ 0.42 \times 0.42 = 0.1764 \]

Add these results together:
\[ 3025 + 23.1 + 23.1 + 0.1764 = 3071.3764 \]

Therefore, the square of the total weight is 3071.3764 grams squared.

If the cost is proportional to the square of the weight, and assuming the proportionality constant is \( k \), the cost \( C \) can be expressed as:
\[ C = k \times 3071.3764 \]

Without the specific value of \( k \), we can only express the cost in terms of \( k \).

        A cheese factory produces 78.3 kilograms of a certain type of cheese each day. If they continually produce this amount for 58.3 days straight, how many kilograms of cheese would have been produced in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of cheese produced, we need to multiply the daily production by the number of days.

Daily production: 78.3 kilograms
Number of days: 58.3 days

Total production = Daily production × Number of days
Total production = 78.3 kg/day × 58.3 days

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 78.3 \times 58.3 = 78.3 \times (58 + 0.3) \]
\[ = 78.3 \times 58 + 78.3 \times 0.3 \]

First, calculate \( 78.3 \times 58 \):

\[ 78.3 \times 58 = 78.3 \times (60 - 2) \]
\[ = 78.3 \times 60 - 78.3 \times 2 \]
\[ = 4698 - 156.6 \]
\[ = 4541.4 \]

Next, calculate \( 78.3 \times 0.3 \):

\[ 78.3 \times 0.3 = 23.49 \]

Now, add the two results together:

\[ 4541.4 + 23.49 = 4564.89 \]

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of cheese the factory has after the additional donation, we need to add the amount of cheese produced in 58.3 days to the additional 19.4 kilograms donated.

From the previous calculation, we know that the factory produced 4564.89 kilograms of cheese in 58.3 days.

Now, we add the additional 19.4 kilograms:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many minutes the rocket can fly with a full tank, we need to divide the total capacity of the fuel tank by the rate of fuel consumption.

The total capacity of the fuel tank is 389.5 gallons.
The rate of fuel consumption is 9.5 gallons per minute.

We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Capacity}}{\text{Rate of Consumption}} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{389.5 \text{ gallons}}{9.5 \text{ gallons per minute}} \]

Perform the division:

To find the total flight time, we add the time already spent in flight to the time the rocket can fly with the full tank:
\[ \text{Total Flight Time} = \text{Time Already Spent} + \text{Time with Full Tank} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Total Flight Time} = 3.69 \text{ minutes} + 41 \text{ minutes} \]

Perform the addition:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many minutes the rocket can fly with 37 gallons of fuel, we need to divide the amount of fuel by the rate of fuel consumption.

The amount of fuel in the tank is 37 gallons.
The rate of fuel consumption is 9.5 gallons per minute.

We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Amount of Fuel}}{\text{Rate of Consumption}} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{37 \text{ gallons}}{9.5 \text{ gallons per minute}} \]

First, let's break it down step-by-step:

\[ 26.7 \times 93.52 = 26.7 \times (90 + 3.52) \]

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pounds of tomatoes will be in each box, we need to divide the total weight of the tomatoes by the number of boxes.

Given:
- Total weight of tomatoes = 441.84 pounds
- Number of boxes = 67

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{441.84 \text{ pounds}}{67 \text{ boxes}} \]

Perform the division:

\[ 441.84 \div 67 \approx 6.594 \]

So, each box will contain approximately 6.594 pounds of tomatoes.

\[ \frac{6548.4}{76.5} \]

First, let's simplify the division by removing the decimal points. We can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to make the division easier:

\[ \frac{6548.4 \times 10}{76.5 \times 10} = \frac{65484}{765} \]

New remaining weight of the collection: 65 pounds

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 93.55 - 65 \]

To make the subtraction easier, we can align the decimal points:
\[ 93.55 \]
\[ -65.00 \]
\[ \_\_\_\_\_\_ \]

Now, subtract the numbers:
\[ 93.55 - 65.00 = 28.55 \]

So, the collector sold 28.55 pounds of stuffed animals.

        Following from the previous scenario, suppose that the initial height of the leading tower was 52 inches instead of 52.7 inches. After the gust of wind, it lost 3.8 inches in height. How tall was the leading tower after the gust?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new height of the tower after the gust of wind, we need to subtract the amount it was shortened by from the initial height.

Initial height of the tower: 52 inches
Amount shortened by the wind: 3.8 inches

New height = Initial height - Amount shortened
New height = 52 inches - 3.8 inches

Let's perform the subtraction:

52.0
- 3.8
_____
48.2

So, the new height of the tower is 48.2 inches.

\[ \frac{3054.4}{33.2} \]

First, let's simplify the division by moving the decimal point one place to the right for both the numerator and the denominator:

We perform the multiplication:
\[ 27.2 \times 89.73 \]

First, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Multiply 27.2 by 89:
\[ 27.2 \times 89 = 2424.8 \]

2. Multiply 27.2 by 0.73:
\[ 27.2 \times 0.73 = 19.856 \]

- Length of the tracking device = 76.48 feet

We add these two lengths together:

        A factory produced 24.91 pencils per minute for a consecutive period of 46.98 minutes. How many pencils were produced in total?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of pencils produced, we need to multiply the rate of production by the time period.

Given:
- Rate of production = 24.91 pencils per minute
- Time period = 46.98 minutes

We perform the multiplication:

\[ 24.91 \times 46.98 \]

First, let's break it down step-by-step:

\[ 24.91 \times 46.98 = 24.91 \times (50 - 3.02) \]
\[ = 24.91 \times 50 - 24.91 \times 3.02 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

\[ 24.91 \times 50 = 1245.5 \]
\[ 24.91 \times 3.02 = 24.91 \times (3 + 0.02) \]
\[ = 24.91 \times 3 + 24.91 \times 0.02 \]
\[ = 74.73 + 0.4982 \]
\[ = 75.2282 \]

Now, subtract the second part from the first part:

The cost of one jacket is $14.97.

The number of jackets is 5.9.

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 14.97 \times 5.9 \]

First, let's break it down:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new weight of the ring after removing 41.42 grams of material, we first need to determine the initial combined weight of the ring and then subtract the removed weight.

From the previous calculation, the initial combined weight of the ring is:

Now, we subtract the weight of the material removed:
\[ 126.15 - 41.42 \]

Aligning the decimal points for subtraction:
\[ 
  126.15 \\

Performing the subtraction:
\[ 
  126.15 \\

Next, we need to account for the decrease in the total weight after adding the silver. The total weight is decreased by 6.74 kilograms.

So, we subtract 6.74 kilograms from the initial total weight:
\[ 93.9 - 6.74 \]

To perform this subtraction, we align the decimal points:
\[ 93.90 - 6.74 \]

Subtracting the numbers:
\[ 93.90 - 6.74 = 87.16 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total weight of the teddy bears, we need to multiply the weight of one teddy bear by the number of teddy bears in the shop.

Given:
- Weight of one teddy bear = 96.8 grams
- Number of teddy bears = 93.3

Total weight = Weight of one teddy bear × Number of teddy bears
Total weight = 96.8 grams × 93.3

        A UFO is found to travel 2.46 light years every month. How far, in light years, would the UFO have travelled after 3.5 months?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how far the UFO would have traveled after 3.5 months, we need to multiply the distance it travels per month by the number of months.

The UFO travels 2.46 light years every month. Therefore, in 3.5 months, the distance traveled would be:

\[ 2.46 \, \text{light years/month} \times 3.5 \, \text{months} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 2.46 \times 3.5 = 2.46 \times (3 + 0.5) = (2.46 \times 3) + (2.46 \times 0.5) \]

First, calculate \( 2.46 \times 3 \):

\[ 2.46 \times 3 = 7.38 \]

Next, calculate \( 2.46 \times 0.5 \):

\[ 2.46 \times 0.5 = 1.23 \]

Now, add the two results together:

\[ 7.38 + 1.23 = 8.61 \]

Therefore, the UFO would have traveled 8.61 light years after 3.5 months.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance the UFO traveled, we need to add the distance it traveled in the first 3.5 months to the additional distance it traveled afterward.

From the previous calculation, we know that the UFO traveled 8.61 light years in the first 3.5 months.

Next, we add the additional distance of 33.17 light years:

\[ 8.61 \, \text{light years} + 33.17 \, \text{light years} \]

Let's perform the addition:

        In the previous situation, the UFO was assumed to travel 2.46 light years every month for 3.5 months. Now assume that the UFO has instead been traveling at that speed for 68 months. How far in light years would the UFO have traveled this time?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how far the UFO would have traveled after 68 months, we need to multiply the distance it travels per month by the number of months.

The UFO travels 2.46 light years every month. Therefore, in 68 months, the distance traveled would be:

\[ 2.46 \, \text{light years/month} \times 68 \, \text{months} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 2.46 \times 68 \]

We can break this down into simpler steps:

\[ 2.46 \times 68 = 2.46 \times (70 - 2) = (2.46 \times 70) - (2.46 \times 2) \]

First, calculate \( 2.46 \times 70 \):

\[ 2.46 \times 70 = 2.46 \times (7 \times 10) = (2.46 \times 7) \times 10 \]

Calculate \( 2.46 \times 7 \):

\[ 2.46 \times 7 = 17.22 \]

Now multiply by 10:

\[ 17.22 \times 10 = 172.2 \]

Next, calculate \( 2.46 \times 2 \):

\[ 2.46 \times 2 = 4.92 \]

Now subtract the two results:

\[ 172.2 - 4.92 = 167.28 \]

Therefore, the UFO would have traveled 167.28 light years after 68 months.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many rainbows the unicorn will need to consume, we need to divide the total units of magic energy required by the amount of energy provided by one rainbow.

Given:
- Total magic energy required: 217.35 units
- Magic energy provided by one rainbow: 20.7 units

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{217.35}{20.7} \]

First, let's simplify the division by removing the decimal points. We can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to get:
\[ \frac{2173.5}{207} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ 2173.5 \div 207 \approx 10.5 \]

Since the unicorn cannot consume a fraction of a rainbow, we need to round up to the nearest whole number because even a partial rainbow would still be required to meet the total energy requirement.

Thus, the unicorn will need:
