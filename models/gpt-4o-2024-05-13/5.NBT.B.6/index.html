        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the average number of miles the school bus drives each week, we need to divide the total number of miles by the number of weeks.

Total miles driven: 2496 miles
Number of weeks: 52 weeks

We perform the division:

\[ \text{Average miles per week} = \frac{2496 \text{ miles}}{52 \text{ weeks}} \]

Let's do the division:

\[ 2496 \div 52 = 48 \]

So, the school bus drives an average of 48 miles each week.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many mice the cat catches each month, we need to divide the total number of mice by the number of months.

The total number of mice caught is 2187, and the period is 27 months.

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{2187}{27} \]

First, let's simplify the division step-by-step:

1. Divide 2187 by 27:
\[ 2187 \div 27 = 81 \]

So, the cat catches 81 mice each month.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many sunglasses are made in each production run, we need to divide the total number of sunglasses by the number of production runs.

Given:
- Total number of sunglasses = 552
- Number of production runs = 69

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{552}{69} \]

First, let's simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 552 and 69. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 552 by 69 and find the remainder:
   \[ 552 \div 69 = 8 \text{ remainder } 0 \]

Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is 69.

Now, we can simplify the division:

\[ \frac{552}{69} = 8 \]

So, each production run produces 8 sunglasses.

Given:
- Total number of sunglasses = 7712
- Number of production runs = 69

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{7712}{69} \]

Let's carry out the division step-by-step:

1. Divide 7712 by 69:
   \[ 7712 \div 69 \approx 111.6 \]

Since we are looking for an exact number of sunglasses per run, we need to perform the division more precisely:

\[ 7712 \div 69 = 111.6 \]

This means each production run produces 111 sunglasses, with a remainder indicating that the division is not exact. However, since we are asked for the number of sunglasses made in each run, we consider the integer part of the division.

Total minutes flown: 1311 minutes

We perform the division:

First, we set up the division:

\[ 1311 \div 23 \]

We can perform the division step-by-step:

1. 23 goes into 131 a total of 5 times (since \( 23 \times 5 = 115 \)).
2. Subtract 115 from 131 to get the remainder: \( 131 - 115 = 16 \).
3. Bring down the next digit (1), making it 161.
4. 23 goes into 161 a total of 7 times (since \( 23 \times 7 = 161 \)).

So, the division is exact, and the quotient is 57.

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{9051 \text{ minutes}}{23 \text{ days}} \]

First, we set up the division:

\[ 9051 \div 23 \]

We can perform the division step-by-step:

1. 23 goes into 90 a total of 3 times (since \( 23 \times 3 = 69 \)).
2. Subtract 69 from 90 to get the remainder: \( 90 - 69 = 21 \).
3. Bring down the next digit (5), making it 215.
4. 23 goes into 215 a total of 9 times (since \( 23 \times 9 = 207 \)).
5. Subtract 207 from 215 to get the remainder: \( 215 - 207 = 8 \).
6. Bring down the next digit (1), making it 81.
7. 23 goes into 81 a total of 3 times (since \( 23 \times 3 = 69 \)).
8. Subtract 69 from 81 to get the remainder: \( 81 - 69 = 12 \).

So, the quotient is 393 with a remainder of 12. Since we are looking for the number of minutes per day, we consider only the quotient.

Therefore, the kite is flown for 393 minutes each day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many centimeters the snail travels daily, we need to divide the total distance by the number of days.

Total distance traveled by the snail = 1610 cm

Given:
- Total number of new bracelets = 5311
- Number of display cases = 56

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{5311}{56} \]

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. Divide 5311 by 56:
\[ 5311 \div 56 \approx 94.8393 \]

Since we are distributing the bracelets equally, we take the integer part of the division result, which is 94.

So, each display case would contain 94 bracelets, with some remaining.

To find the exact number of remaining bracelets:
\[ 5311 - (94 \times 56) = 5311 - 5264 = 47 \]

Thus, each display case would contain 94 bracelets, and there would be 47 bracelets left over.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many seconds the rainbow spends on each cycle, we need to divide the total duration of the rainbow's appearance by the number of cycles it completes.

The total duration of the rainbow's appearance is 8713 seconds, and it cycles through its complete range of colors 8 times.

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{8713 \text{ seconds}}{8 \text{ cycles}} = 1089.125 \text{ seconds per cycle} \]

2. 58 goes into 330 six times (since 58 * 6 = 348, which is too high, we use 5 times).
3. 58 * 5 = 290
4. Subtract 290 from 330 to get 40.
5. Bring down the next digit (6), making it 406.
6. 58 goes into 406 seven times (since 58 * 7 = 406).

            After another production run, the toy shop produced an additional 9115 doll clothes and distributed them evenly among the same 58 dolls. How many pieces of clothing did each doll get this time?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pieces of clothing each doll received in the second production run, we need to divide the total number of doll clothes by the number of dolls.

Given:
- Total doll clothes = 9115
- Number of dolls = 58

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{9115}{58} \]

First, let's do the division step-by-step:

1. 9115 Ã· 58
2. 58 goes into 91 one time (since 58 * 1 = 58).
3. Subtract 58 from 91 to get 33.
4. Bring down the next digit (1), making it 331.
5. 58 goes into 331 five times (since 58 * 5 = 290).
6. Subtract 290 from 331 to get 41.
7. Bring down the next digit (5), making it 415.
8. 58 goes into 415 seven times (since 58 * 7 = 406).

So, 9115 Ã· 58 = 157.

Each doll gets 157 pieces of clothing.

Given:
- New total number of ice skates = 3887
- Number of store locations = 38

We perform the division:

Let's carry out the division step-by-step:

1. Divide 3887 by 38:
\[ 3887 \div 38 \approx 102.289 \]

Since we are distributing physical items (ice skates), we need to consider the integer part of the division result, as we cannot distribute a fraction of an ice skate.

Thus, each store will receive 102 ice skates, and there will be some remainder.

To find the remainder:
\[ 3887 - (38 \times 102) = 3887 - 3876 = 11 \]

So, each store will receive 102 ice skates, and there will be 11 ice skates left over.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pages you need to read each day, you divide the total number of pages by the number of days.

Total number of pages: 4606
Number of days: 47

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{4606}{47} \]

First, let's do the division step-by-step:

1. 47 goes into 4606 approximately 98 times (since \( 47 \times 98 = 4606 \)).

Thus, you need to read:

\[ \frac{4606}{47} = 98 \]

Given:
- Total marshmallows = 3025

We perform the division:

First, let's estimate how many times 55 goes into 3025. We can start by simplifying the division:

\[ 3025 \div 55 \approx 55 \times 55 = 3025 \]

So, we can see that:

Let's calculate this:

Since we are looking for an integer number of marshmallows per bag, we take the integer part of the division, which is 1. This means each bag will contain 1 marshmallow, and there will be some marshmallows left over.

To find the exact number of marshmallows left over, we can calculate the remainder:

\[ 3025 \mod 2011 = 3025 - (2011 \times 1) = 3025 - 2011 = 1014 \]

So, each of the 2011 bags will contain 1 marshmallow, and there will be 1014 marshmallows left over.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many beads each bracelet would have if the jeweler made 495 bracelets, we need to divide the total number of beads by the number of bracelets.

Given:
- Total number of beads = 1944
- Number of bracelets = 495

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{1944}{495} \]

First, let's simplify the division step-by-step:

1. Simplify the fraction \(\frac{1944}{495}\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1944 and 495.

The prime factorization of 1944 is:
\[ 1944 = 2^3 \times 3^5 \]

The prime factorization of 495 is:
\[ 495 = 3^2 \times 5 \times 11 \]

The common prime factors are \(3^2\).

So, the GCD is:
\[ 3^2 = 9 \]

Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD (9):
\[ \frac{1944 \div 9}{495 \div 9} = \frac{216}{55} \]

Since 216 and 55 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction \(\frac{216}{55}\) cannot be simplified further. Therefore, each bracelet will have:
\[ \frac{216}{55} \approx 3.927 \]

Since the number of beads must be an integer, it is not possible to evenly distribute 1944 beads into 495 bracelets.

\[ \text{Number of doors} = \frac{80 \text{ inches}}{80 \text{ inches/door}} \]
\[ \text{Number of doors} = 1 \]

Thus, the carpenter can make exactly one door.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many doors the carpenter can make with 4322 inches of wood, we need to divide the total amount of wood by the amount required for one door.

Each door requires 80 inches of wood.

We can calculate the number of doors as follows:
\[ \text{Number of doors} = \frac{\text{Total wood}}{\text{Wood per door}} \]
\[ \text{Number of doors} = \frac{4322 \text{ inches}}{80 \text{ inches/door}} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \text{Number of doors} = 54.025 \]

Since the carpenter cannot make a fraction of a door, we take the integer part of the result:
\[ \text{Number of doors} = 54 \]

Thus, the carpenter can make 54 doors with 4322 inches of wood.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many lamps each store will receive, we need to divide the total number of lamps by the number of stores.

\[
\text{Total number of lamps} = 2907
\]
\[
\text{Number of stores} = 51

We perform the division:

\[
2907 \div 51

First, we estimate how many times 51 goes into 2907. We can start by checking how many times 51 goes into the first few digits of 2907.

1. 51 goes into 290 (the first three digits of 2907) approximately 5 times because \(51 \times 5 = 255\).
2. Subtract 255 from 290 to get the remainder: \(290 - 255 = 35\).
3. Bring down the next digit (7), making it 357.
4. 51 goes into 357 approximately 7 times because \(51 \times 7 = 357\).

Thus, 51 goes into 2907 exactly 57 times.

\[
2907 \div 51 = 57

            Suppose the company instead manufactured a total of 4753 lamps that are to be divided equally among the 51 stores. How many lamps will each store receive now?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many lamps each store will receive, we need to divide the total number of lamps by the number of stores.

\[
\text{Total number of lamps} = 4753
\]
\[
\text{Number of stores} = 51
\]

We perform the division:

\[
4753 \div 51
\]

First, we estimate how many times 51 goes into 4753. We can start by checking how many times 51 goes into the first few digits of 4753.

1. 51 goes into 475 (the first three digits of 4753) approximately 9 times because \(51 \times 9 = 459\).
2. Subtract 459 from 475 to get the remainder: \(475 - 459 = 16\).
3. Bring down the next digit (3), making it 163.
4. 51 goes into 163 approximately 3 times because \(51 \times 3 = 153\).
5. Subtract 153 from 163 to get the remainder: \(163 - 153 = 10\).

Thus, 51 goes into 4753 approximately 93 times with a remainder of 10.

\[
4753 \div 51 = 93 \text{ R } 10
\]

So, each store will receive 93 lamps, and there will be 10 lamps left over.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the fuel consumption per hour, we need to divide the total fuel consumed by the total number of hours.

Given:
- Total fuel consumed = 204 liters
- Total time = 51 hours

We calculate the fuel consumption per hour as follows:

\[
\text{Fuel consumption per hour} = \frac{\text{Total fuel consumed}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{204 \text{ liters}}{51 \text{ hours}}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{204}{51} = 4
\]

So, the boat consumes 4 liters of fuel per hour.

First, let's simplify the division step-by-step:

1. 3612 divided by 86:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many gold coins are in each bag, we need to divide the total number of gold coins by the number of bags.

Given:
- Total gold coins = 7280
- Number of bags = 91

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{7280}{91} \]

First, let's set up the division:
\[ 7280 \div 91 \]

Performing the division step-by-step:
1. 91 goes into 7280 approximately 80 times (since \( 91 \times 80 = 7280 \)).

Thus, each bag contains:
\[ 7280 \div 91 = 80 \]

We perform the division:

First, let's set up the division:

Performing the division step-by-step:
1. 91 goes into 5857 approximately 64 times (since \( 91 \times 64 = 5824 \)).
2. Subtracting 5824 from 5857 gives a remainder of 33.

            Let's consider that our dragon, instead of collecting 3010 jewels over 43 years, increased his hoard to 6402 jewels over the same period. If the dragon collected at an even pace throughout these years, how many jewels did he collect each year now?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many jewels the dragon collected each year, we need to divide the total number of jewels by the number of years.

Total number of jewels: 6402
Number of years: 43

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{6402}{43} \]

First, let's do the division step-by-step:

1. 6402 divided by 43 gives approximately 148.88.

Since we are looking for the number of jewels collected each year, we round to the nearest whole number:

\[ \frac{6402}{43} \approx 149 \]

Thus, the dragon collected 149 jewels each year.

            If the alien spaceship from the previous problem actually sent out the same pattern of 6699 signals over the course of 2715 Earth days instead of 87 days, how many signals does it now send daily?
        </p>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many signals the alien spaceship sends daily over 2715 Earth days, we need to divide the total number of signals by the number of days.

Total number of signals: 6699
Number of days: 2715

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{6699}{2715} \]

First, let's simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6699 and 2715. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 6699 by 2715 and find the remainder:
   \[ 6699 \div 2715 \approx 2 \]
   \[ 6699 - (2715 \times 2) = 6699 - 5430 = 1269 \]

2. Now, divide 2715 by 1269 and find the remainder:
   \[ 2715 \div 1269 \approx 2 \]
   \[ 2715 - (1269 \times 2) = 2715 - 2538 = 177 \]

3. Next, divide 1269 by 177 and find the remainder:
   \[ 1269 \div 177 \approx 7 \]
   \[ 1269 - (177 \times 7) = 1269 - 1239 = 30 \]

4. Now, divide 177 by 30 and find the remainder:
   \[ 177 \div 30 \approx 5 \]
   \[ 177 - (30 \times 5) = 177 - 150 = 27 \]

5. Next, divide 30 by 27 and find the remainder:
   \[ 30 \div 27 \approx 1 \]
   \[ 30 - (27 \times 1) = 30 - 27 = 3 \]

6. Finally, divide 27 by 3 and find the remainder:
   \[ 27 \div 3 \approx 9 \]
   \[ 27 - (3 \times 9) = 27 - 27 = 0 \]

The GCD of 6699 and 2715 is 3.

Now, we simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{6699 \div 3}{2715 \div 3} = \frac{2233}{905} \]

Next, we perform the division:

\[ 2233 \div 905 \approx 2.467 \]

So, the spaceship sends approximately 2.467 signals daily.

\[ \text{Total gifts} = 741 \]
\[ \text{Number of shelters} = 13 \]

We perform the division:

\[ 741 \div 13 \]

First, we see how many times 13 fits into 74 (the first two digits of 741):

\[ 74 \div 13 \approx 5 \]

So, 13 goes into 74 approximately 5 times. We multiply to check:

\[ 13 \times 5 = 65 \]

Subtract 65 from 74:

\[ 74 - 65 = 9 \]

Now, bring down the next digit (1) to get 91. Next, we see how many times 13 fits into 91:

\[ 91 \div 13 \approx 7 \]

So, 13 goes into 91 approximately 7 times. We multiply to check:

\[ 13 \times 7 = 91 \]

Subtract 91 from 91:

\[ 91 - 91 = 0 \]

Thus, the division is exact, and each shelter receives:

            The benefactor decided to be even more generous and increased the number of gifts to 3697. If these additional gifts were also evenly divided between the 13 shelters, then how many gifts did each shelter receive now?
        </p>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many gifts each shelter received after the increase, we need to divide the new total number of gifts by the number of shelters.

\[ \text{Total gifts} = 3697 \]
\[ \text{Number of shelters} = 13 \]

We perform the division:

\[ 3697 \div 13 \]

First, we see how many times 13 fits into 36 (the first two digits of 3697):

\[ 36 \div 13 \approx 2 \]

So, 13 goes into 36 approximately 2 times. We multiply to check:

\[ 13 \times 2 = 26 \]

Subtract 26 from 36:

\[ 36 - 26 = 10 \]

Now, bring down the next digit (9) to get 109. Next, we see how many times 13 fits into 109:

\[ 109 \div 13 \approx 8 \]

So, 13 goes into 109 approximately 8 times. We multiply to check:

\[ 13 \times 8 = 104 \]

Subtract 104 from 109:

\[ 109 - 104 = 5 \]

Now, bring down the next digit (7) to get 57. Next, we see how many times 13 fits into 57:

\[ 57 \div 13 \approx 4 \]

So, 13 goes into 57 approximately 4 times. We multiply to check:

\[ 13 \times 4 = 52 \]

Subtract 52 from 57:

\[ 57 - 52 = 5 \]

Thus, the division is not exact, and we have a remainder. Each shelter receives:

\[ 3697 \div 13 = 284 \text{ with a remainder of } 5 \]

The total volume of the giant snowball is 528 cubic feet, and there are 16 smaller snowballs.

We perform the division:

            A slide is 728 inches long and has evenly spaced waves every 56 inches. How many waves are there on the slide?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of waves on the slide, we need to divide the total length of the slide by the length of each wave.

Given:
- Total length of the slide = 728 inches
- Length of each wave = 56 inches

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{728 \text{ inches}}{56 \text{ inches/wave}} \]

First, we simplify the division:
\[ 728 \div 56 \]

To make the division easier, we can use long division:

1. 56 goes into 72 once (1 time), because \( 56 \times 1 = 56 \).
2. Subtract 56 from 72 to get 16.
3. Bring down the next digit, which is 8, making it 168.
4. 56 goes into 168 exactly three times (3 times), because \( 56 \times 3 = 168 \).

So, the division is:
\[ 728 \div 56 = 13 \]

Therefore, there are 13 waves on the slide.

            The slide in the amusement park is being redesigned, and its new length is 3769 inches. The waves are still placed every 56 inches. How many waves will the redesigned slide have now?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of waves on the redesigned slide, we need to divide the total length of the slide by the length of each wave.

Given:
- Total length of the redesigned slide = 3769 inches
- Length of each wave = 56 inches

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{3769 \text{ inches}}{56 \text{ inches/wave}} \]

First, we simplify the division:
\[ 3769 \div 56 \]

To make the division easier, we can use long division:

1. 56 goes into 376 six times (6 times), because \( 56 \times 6 = 336 \).
2. Subtract 336 from 376 to get 40.
3. Bring down the next digit, which is 9, making it 409.
4. 56 goes into 409 seven times (7 times), because \( 56 \times 7 = 392 \).
5. Subtract 392 from 409 to get 17.

So, the division is:
\[ 3769 \div 56 = 67 \text{ remainder } 17 \]

Since we are only interested in the number of complete waves, we ignore the remainder.

Therefore, the number of waves on the redesigned slide is 67.
