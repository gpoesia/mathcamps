        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the additional hours John spends to finish the puzzle, we need to determine the value of \( b \).

We know that John spends a total of 13 hours working on the puzzle, and he initially spends 7 hours. Therefore, the equation representing the total time spent is:

\[ 7 + b = 13 \]

To solve for \( b \), we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

\[ b = 13 - 7 \]

\[ b = 6 \]

So, John spends an additional 6 hours to finish the puzzle.

The princess originally had 14 jewels.
After receiving more jewels from her loyal subject, she now has a total of 49 jewels.

We can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Original jewels} + \text{Found jewels} = \text{Total jewels} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 14 + \text{Found jewels} = 49 \]

To find the number of jewels the subject found, we subtract 14 from 49:

Let \( a \) be the original number of sleeping bags.

After selling 36 sleeping bags, the shop is left with 35 sleeping bags. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ a - 36 = 35 \]

To find \( a \), we solve the equation by adding 36 to both sides:
\[ a - 36 + 36 = 35 + 36 \]
\[ a = 71 \]

According to the problem, if we decrease this angle by 24 degrees, it becomes 52 degrees. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ j - 24 = 52 \]

To find the value of \( j \), we need to solve this equation. We do this by adding 24 to both sides of the equation:

\[ j - 24 + 24 = 52 + 24 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ j = 76 \]

According to the problem, after removing 3 gallons of water, the remaining amount of water is 40 gallons. This can be expressed with the equation:

To find the initial amount of water \( g \), we need to solve this equation. We do this by adding 3 to both sides of the equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the original number of beds in the dormitory, we need to account for the 8 beds that were removed for repair. We know that after removing these 8 beds, there were still 72 beds left.

Let's denote the original number of beds as \( x \).

According to the problem, if 8 beds are removed from the original number, 72 beds remain. This can be expressed with the equation:
\[ x - 8 = 72 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by adding 8 to both sides:
\[ x - 8 + 8 = 72 + 8 \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Thus, the original number of beds in the dormitory was 80.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's denote the number of sheets of star stickers the teacher initially had as \( a \).

Given:
- The teacher used 60 stickers.
- After using the stickers, she has 2 sheets left.

We need to find the initial number of sheets, \( a \).

First, we need to understand that the teacher used \( a - 2 \) sheets of stickers, since she has 2 sheets left.

Since each sheet contains a certain number of stickers, let's denote the number of stickers per sheet as \( s \).

The total number of stickers used is given by:
\[ (a - 2) \times s = 60 \]

To find \( a \), we need to know the number of stickers per sheet, \( s \). However, since \( s \) is not provided, we can only express \( a \) in terms of \( s \).

Rearranging the equation to solve for \( a \):
\[ a - 2 = \frac{60}{s} \]
\[ a = \frac{60}{s} + 2 \]

Thus, the initial number of sheets \( a \) is:
\[ a = \frac{60}{s} + 2 \]

Without the value of \( s \), we cannot determine a specific numerical value for \( a \). Therefore, the answer is expressed in terms of \( s \).

Fahim initially bought 7 towels. The total number of towels he has now is 58.

Let's denote the number of towels Fahim bought in his subsequent visits as \( x \).

The equation to solve is:
\[ 7 + x = 58 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 58 - 7 \]
\[ x = 51 \]

            The zoo started the day with some number of animals, which we'll call s. During the day, 24 animals were moved to a separate area of the zoo for cleaning and care.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total number of animals at the zoo at the start of the day, we need to account for both the animals that were moved and the animals that remained visible to visitors.

Let's denote the total number of animals at the start of the day as \( s \).

According to the problem:
- 24 animals were moved to a separate area.
- 75 animals remained visible to visitors.

This means that the total number of animals at the start of the day is the sum of the animals that were moved and the animals that remained visible.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ s = 75 + 24 \]

Now, we solve for \( s \):
\[ s = 99 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the initial number of strawberries, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

\[ j - 43 = 13 \]

To solve for \( j \), we need to isolate \( j \) on one side of the equation. We do this by adding 43 to both sides of the equation:

\[ j - 43 + 43 = 13 + 43 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ j = 56 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the original number of flowers in the garden, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

Initially, there were \( p \) flowers.
21 flowers wilted, so the number of flowers left is \( p - 21 \).
We are told that there are now 11 flowers left.

Thus, we can write the equation:
\[ p - 21 = 11 \]

To solve for \( p \), we add 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ p - 21 + 21 = 11 + 21 \]
\[ p = 32 \]

So, the original number of flowers in the garden was 32.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the initial number of bars of soap in the storage, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( f \) represent the initial number of bars of soap.

According to the problem, after donating 9 bars, there are 81 bars left. This can be expressed as:
\[ f - 9 = 81 \]

To find \( f \), we solve the equation by adding 9 to both sides:
\[ f - 9 + 9 = 81 + 9 \]
\[ f = 90 \]

Thus, the initial number of bars of soap in the storage was 90.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pillows Billy will have left in his fort after removing 46 pillows, we need to subtract 46 from the total number of pillows he initially has.

Starting with 56 pillows:
\[ 56 - 46 = 10 \]

So, Billy will have 10 pillows left in his fort.
