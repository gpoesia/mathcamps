Next, Mia buys an additional 19 meters of string.

            After figuring out how many more feet Hank needs to dig to reach the planned length of his tunnel, he decides to expand the tunnel by an additional 22 feet to make it more spacious. How many feet in total does Hank now need to dig to very the new planned length for his tunnel?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we already determined that Hank needs to dig 20 more feet to reach his original planned length of 82 feet.

Now, Hank decides to expand the tunnel by an additional 22 feet. Therefore, we need to add this additional length to the 20 feet he still needs to dig.

\[ 20 \text{ feet} + 22 \text{ feet} = 42 \text{ feet} \]

So, Hank now needs to dig a total of 42 more feet to reach the new planned length for his tunnel.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many more feet Hank needs to dig, we subtract the length of the tunnel he has already dug from the planned length of the tunnel.

Planned length of the tunnel: 82 feet
Length of the tunnel already dug: 42 feet

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 82 - 42 = 40 \]

So, Hank needs to dig 40 more feet to reach his planned length.

Starting length of the string: 67 meters

Next, Jake bought an additional 35 meters of string. We need to add this to the remaining length of the string.

            Upon review, the contractor realized that he had made a measurement error in his initial calculation. In place of the 31 meters of plumbing pipe for the ground floor, he actually needed only 10 meters. After making this correction, adjusting for the second floor and the subsequent adjustments including saving some pipes by re-routing and then adding a separate water line for the garden, what is now the total length of plumbing pipes remaining?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's start by recalculating the total length of plumbing pipes needed after correcting the measurement error for the ground floor.

Initially, the contractor thought he needed 31 meters for the ground floor, but he actually needed only 10 meters. The length for the second floor remains the same at 45 meters.

First, calculate the corrected total length of plumbing pipes before any savings or additions:

\[ 10 \text{ meters (ground floor)} + 45 \text{ meters (second floor)} = 55 \text{ meters} \]

Next, the contractor saves 22 meters by re-routing:

\[ 55 \text{ meters} - 22 \text{ meters} = 33 \text{ meters} \]

Finally, the contractor adds a separate water line for the garden. Let's assume the length of this separate water line is given or needs to be added. Since the length of the garden water line is not specified in the problem, we will assume it is \( x \) meters.

Thus, the total length of plumbing pipes remaining after all adjustments is:

\[ 33 \text{ meters} + x \text{ meters} \]

Without the specific length of the garden water line, the final answer is expressed in terms of \( x \):

### Answer: 33 + x meters</pre>

Next, we need to find out how much of the original 67-foot rope Peter has left after using some of it for other projects. Since he now has a 22-foot rope, we subtract this length from the original 67-foot rope:

1. Juniper starts with a banner that is 86 centimeters long.
2. She extends the banner by 3 centimeters. So, the new length of the banner is:

3. Then, she reduces the length of the banner by 88 centimeters. So, the final length of the banner is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many meters of rope are left uncut, we need to subtract the length of the rope that Bob decided to cut from the total length of the rope.

The total length of the rope is 14 meters.
The length of the rope that Bob decided to cut is 7 meters.

So, the length of the rope left uncut is:
\[ 14 \text{ meters} - 7 \text{ meters} = 7 \text{ meters} \]

Original ribbon length: 24 inches
Length cut off: 13 inches

Length of the ribbon after cutting:
\[ 24 - 13 = 11 \text{ inches} \]

Next, Robin buys another ribbon that is 50 inches long. We need to find the total length of both ribbons together.

Length of the first ribbon after cutting: 11 inches

We sum these lengths to find the total:

We add these amounts together:

            Alice ran a total of 93 miles this past month to prepare for the upcoming marathon race. However, she knows that 78 of these miles were run on a paved road. How many miles did Alice run not on a paved road in the past month?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many miles Alice ran not on a paved road, we need to subtract the number of miles she ran on a paved road from the total number of miles she ran.

Total miles run by Alice: 93 miles
Miles run on a paved road: 78 miles

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 93 - 78 = 15 \]

So, Alice ran 15 miles not on a paved road.

The tailor used 15 meters of fabric for the trousers and 80 meters of fabric for the coat.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many meters of fabric remained in the finished costumes, we need to subtract the fabric removed from the coat from the total fabric used initially.

Initially, the tailor used:
- 15 meters for the trousers
- 80 meters for the coat

Total initial fabric used = 15 meters + 80 meters = 95 meters

The tailor removed 71 meters of fabric from the coat.

Remaining fabric in the coat = 80 meters - 71 meters = 9 meters

Now, the total remaining fabric in the finished costumes is the sum of the fabric in the trousers and the remaining fabric in the coat:
- Fabric in trousers: 15 meters

1. Calculate the initial total length of the fence:

   - Length still to be installed: 77 meters

   Initial total length = 17 meters + 77 meters
   Initial total length = 94 meters

2. Subtract the reduction from the initial total length:
   - Reduction: 31 meters

   Final length of the fence = Initial total length - Reduction

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the length of wood remaining after John cuts the shorter piece from the longer one.

The longer piece is 51 inches, and the shorter piece is 45 inches. Subtract the length of the shorter piece from the longer piece:
\[ 51 \text{ inches} - 45 \text{ inches} = 6 \text{ inches} \]

Next, John adds a piece that is 40 inches long to the remaining length of 6 inches:
\[ 6 \text{ inches} + 40 \text{ inches} = 46 \text{ inches} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the correct total length of all the cassette tapes Travis bought, we need to adjust the length of the tape that was mistakenly thought to be 62 inches long to its actual length of 29 inches.

First, we add the lengths of the two initial tapes with the corrected length:
\[ 19 \text{ inches} + 29 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we add the length of the additional tape:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 6 \text{ inches} = 54 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the total length of all the cassette tapes combined is:

Let's denote the total length of the initial stack of bricks as \( L \).
