        <pre class="model-raw-response">An equilateral triangle has all three sides of equal length. To find the length of each side, we need to divide the perimeter by the number of sides.

Given:
- Perimeter of the equilateral triangle = 990 cm
- Number of sides in an equilateral triangle = 3

Let's calculate the length of each side:
\[ \text{Length of each side} = \frac{\text{Perimeter}}{\text{Number of sides}} \]
\[ \text{Length of each side} = \frac{990 \text{ cm}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Length of each side} = 330 \text{ cm} \]

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. We can set up the equation as follows:

Given:
- Perimeter = 997 meters
- Side 1 = 2 meters
- Side 2 = 667 meters

Let \( \text{Side 3} \) be \( x \) meters. Then we have:

\[ 997 = 2 + 667 + x \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):

\[ 997 = 669 + x \]

Subtract 669 from both sides:

\[ 997 - 669 = x \]

\[ 328 = x \]

So, the length of the third side is 328 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the remaining side of the triangle, we need to use the information about the perimeter and the lengths of the other two sides.

The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = \text{Side 1} + \text{Side 2} + \text{Side 3} \]

Given:
- Perimeter = 503 meters
- Side 1 = 223 meters
- Side 2 = 46 meters

Let \( \text{Side 3} \) be the length of the remaining side. We can write the equation as:

\[ 503 = 223 + 46 + \text{Side 3} \]

To find \( \text{Side 3} \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. First, add the lengths of Side 1 and Side 2:

\[ 223 + 46 = 269 \]

Now, substitute this sum back into the equation:

\[ 503 = 269 + \text{Side 3} \]

Next, subtract 269 from both sides to solve for \( \text{Side 3} \):

\[ \text{Side 3} = 503 - 269 \]

Calculate the difference:

\[ \text{Side 3} = 234 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the length of each side of an equilateral triangle, we need to remember that all three sides are equal in length. 

Given that the total perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 405 cm, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = \text{Side length} \times 3 \]

Let \( s \) be the length of each side. Therefore, we have:

\[ 3s = 405 \]

To find the length of one side, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ s = \frac{405}{3} \]

\[ s = 135 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the third side of the triangular field, we need to use the perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter is the sum of all three sides of the triangle.

Given:
- Perimeter of the triangular field = 828 meters
- Length of the first side = 105 meters
- Length of the second side = 434 meters

Let the length of the third side be \( x \) meters.

The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all three sides:

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 105 + 434 + x = 828 \]
\[ 539 + x = 828 \]

Subtract 539 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 828 - 539 \]

Given:
- One side of the triangle = 147 meters

Let the length of the third side be \( x \) meters.

The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of all three sides:

Given:

- Length of the second side = 195 meters

Let the length of the third side be \( x \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of the triangle, we start by noting that the triangle is equilateral, meaning all three sides are equal in length.

Given:
- Perimeter of the triangle = 195 cm
- Number of sides in a triangle = 3

Since all sides are equal, we can denote the length of each side as \( x \).

The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is given by the sum of all its sides:
\[ 3x = 195 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{195}{3} \]
\[ x = 65 \]

Thus, the length of each side of the triangle is 65 cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of an equilateral triangle, we need to remember that all three sides are equal in length. The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides.

Given:
- Perimeter of the equilateral triangle = 258 cm

Let \( s \) be the length of each side of the equilateral triangle. Therefore, the perimeter can be expressed as:
\[ 3s = 258 \]

To find \( s \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

Let's denote the length of the third side as \( x \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the third side of the triangle, we need to use the perimeter of the triangle. The perimeter is the sum of all three sides.

Given:
- Perimeter of the triangle = 925 meters

Let the length of the third side be \( x \).

The perimeter equation is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the last side of the triangle, we need to use the information given about the perimeter and the lengths of the other two sides.

The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = \text{Side 1} + \text{Side 2} + \text{Side 3} \]

Given:
- Perimeter = 499 meters
- Side 1 (largest side) = 259 meters
- Side 2 = 11 meters

Let \( \text{Side 3} \) be the length of the last side. We can write the equation:

\[ 499 = 259 + 11 + \text{Side 3} \]

To find the length of Side 3, we solve for \( \text{Side 3} \):

\[ \text{Side 3} = 499 - 259 - 11 \]

First, subtract 259 from 499:

\[ 499 - 259 = 240 \]

Next, subtract 11 from 240:

\[ 240 - 11 = 229 \]

So, the length of the last side is 229 meters.

Let the length of the third side be \( x \).

The formula for the perimeter is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the third side of the triangular field, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle. The perimeter \( P \) of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. Given that the perimeter is 661 meters and two sides are 382 meters and 151 meters, we can set up the equation:

\[ P = \text{side}_1 + \text{side}_2 + \text{side}_3 \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ 661 = 382 + 151 + \text{side}_3 \]

To find the length of the third side, we solve for \(\text{side}_3\):

\[ \text{side}_3 = 661 - 382 - 151 \]

First, we perform the subtraction step-by-step:

\[ 661 - 382 = 279 \]

Then,

\[ 279 - 151 = 128 \]

So, the length of the third side is 128 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the third side of the triangular field, we start by using the formula for the perimeter of a triangle. The perimeter \( P \) is the sum of the lengths of all three sides.

Given:
- Total perimeter \( P = 739 \) meters
- Length of the first side \( a = 180 \) meters
- Length of the second side \( b = 338 \) meters

Let the length of the third side be \( c \).

The formula for the perimeter is:
\[ P = a + b + c \]

Substituting the given values into the formula:
\[ 739 = 180 + 338 + c \]

To find \( c \), we solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 739 - 180 - 338 \]

First, calculate \( 180 + 338 \):
\[ 180 + 338 = 518 \]

Then, subtract this sum from the total perimeter:
\[ c = 739 - 518 \]
\[ c = 221 \]

To find \( s \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ s = \frac{411}{3} \]

Calculating the division:
\[ s = 137 \]

Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 137 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">An equilateral triangle has all three sides of equal length. To find the length of each side, we need to divide the perimeter by the number of sides.

Given:
- Perimeter of the equilateral triangle = 114 cm
- Number of sides in a triangle = 3

Let's calculate the length of each side:
\[ \text{Length of each side} = \frac{\text{Perimeter}}{\text{Number of sides}} \]
\[ \text{Length of each side} = \frac{114 \, \text{cm}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Length of each side} = 38 \, \text{cm} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of an equilateral triangle, we need to remember that all three sides are equal in length. 

Given that the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 69 meters, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = \text{Side length} \times 3 \]

Let \( s \) be the length of each side. Therefore, we have:

\[ 3s = 69 \]

To find \( s \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ s = \frac{69}{3} \]

\[ s = 23 \]

So, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 23 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the third side of the triangle, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

Given:
- The lengths of two sides are 464 meters and 377 meters.
- The total perimeter of the triangle is 907 meters.

Let the length of the third side be \( x \).

The perimeter of the triangle is given by:
\[ 464 + 377 + x = 907 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ 464 + 377 + x = 907 \]
\[ 841 + x = 907 \]
\[ x = 907 - 841 \]
\[ x = 66 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of an equilateral triangle, we need to divide the perimeter by the number of sides. An equilateral triangle has three equal sides.

Given:
Perimeter = 966 meters

Since the triangle is equilateral, each side is equal. Therefore, we divide the perimeter by 3:

\[
\text{Length of each side} = \frac{\text{Perimeter}}{3} = \frac{966 \, \text{m}}{3}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{966}{3} = 322 \, \text{m}
\]
