        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance the ball traveled, we need to add the distances thrown by Kyle and Lisa.

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator. The denominators are 4 and 9. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 9 is 36.

Convert \( \frac{18}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 36:
\[ \frac{18}{4} = \frac{18 \times 9}{4 \times 9} = \frac{162}{36} \]

Convert \( \frac{19}{9} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 36:
\[ \frac{19}{9} = \frac{19 \times 4}{9 \times 4} = \frac{76}{36} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{162}{36} + \frac{76}{36} = \frac{162 + 76}{36} = \frac{238}{36} \]

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{238}{36} \):
\[ \frac{238 \div 2}{36 \div 2} = \frac{119}{18} \]

Thus, the total distance the ball traveled is \( \frac{119}{18} \) yards.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the remaining distance after subtracting the additional bounce, we need to subtract \( \frac{3}{13} \) yards from the total distance \( \frac{119}{18} \) yards.

First, we need a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{119}{18} \) and \( \frac{3}{13} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 13 is 234.

Convert \( \frac{119}{18} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 234:
\[ \frac{119}{18} = \frac{119 \times 13}{18 \times 13} = \frac{1547}{234} \]

Convert \( \frac{3}{13} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 234:
\[ \frac{3}{13} = \frac{3 \times 18}{13 \times 18} = \frac{54}{234} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{1547}{234} - \frac{54}{234} = \frac{1547 - 54}{234} = \frac{1493}{234} \]

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{1493}{234} \):
Since 1493 and 234 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the remaining distance is \( \frac{1493}{234} \) yards.

The fraction \( \frac{18}{7} \) is already in its simplest form.

Next, we simplify \( \frac{12}{14} \):
\[ \frac{12}{14} = \frac{12 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{6}{7} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{18}{7} + \frac{6}{7} \]

Since the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators directly:
\[ \frac{18 + 6}{7} = \frac{24}{7} \]

So, the total number of bananas given to Johnnie the monkey is \( \frac{24}{7} \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance of the bottom and top of the door from the floor and ceiling, respectively, we need to add the two given measurements.

The bottom of the door is 4/19 inches from the floor.
The top of the door is 9/10 inches from the ceiling.

First, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple of 19 and 10 is 190.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 190:
\[ \frac{4}{19} = \frac{4 \times 10}{19 \times 10} = \frac{40}{190} \]
\[ \frac{9}{10} = \frac{9 \times 19}{10 \times 19} = \frac{171}{190} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{40}{190} + \frac{171}{190} = \frac{40 + 171}{190} = \frac{211}{190} \]

Since \(\frac{211}{190}\) is an improper fraction, we can convert it to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{211}{190} = 1 \frac{21}{190} \]

Thus, the total distance of the bottom and top of the door from the floor and ceiling, respectively, is:
\[ 1 \frac{21}{190} \] inches.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance considering the bottoms and tops of both the front and back doors from the floor and ceiling, we need to double the distance we calculated for one door.

From the previous calculation, the total distance for one door is:
\[ 1 \frac{21}{190} \] inches.

To find the total distance for both doors, we multiply this distance by 2.

First, convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:
\[ 1 \frac{21}{190} = \frac{190}{190} + \frac{21}{190} = \frac{211}{190} \]

Now, multiply by 2:
\[ 2 \times \frac{211}{190} = \frac{2 \times 211}{190} = \frac{422}{190} \]

Convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{422}{190} = 2 \frac{42}{190} \]

Simplify the fraction \(\frac{42}{190}\):
\[ \frac{42}{190} = \frac{21}{95} \]

The bottom of the door is now \( \frac{4}{16} \) inches from the floor.
The top of the door is \( \frac{9}{10} \) inches from the ceiling.

First, simplify \( \frac{4}{16} \):
\[ \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Next, we need to find a common denominator to add \( \frac{1}{4} \) and \( \frac{9}{10} \). The least common multiple of 4 and 10 is 20.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 20:

\[ \frac{9}{10} = \frac{9 \times 2}{10 \times 2} = \frac{18}{20} \]

Now, add the two fractions:

Since \( \frac{23}{20} \) is an improper fraction, we can convert it to a mixed number:

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator to make the subtraction easier. The denominators are 3 and 11. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 11 is 33.

Convert \( \frac{17}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 33:
\[ \frac{17}{3} = \frac{17 \times 11}{3 \times 11} = \frac{187}{33} \]

Convert \( \frac{15}{11} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 33:
\[ \frac{15}{11} = \frac{15 \times 3}{11 \times 3} = \frac{45}{33} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{187}{33} - \frac{45}{33} = \frac{187 - 45}{33} = \frac{142}{33} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many liters of unused apple juice are left after Ralph adds an additional \( \frac{3}{18} \) liters to the mix, we need to subtract this additional amount from the previously calculated unused amount.

First, simplify \( \frac{3}{18} \):
\[ \frac{3}{18} = \frac{1}{6} \]

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{1}{6} \) from \( \frac{142}{33} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 33 and 6 is 198.

Convert \( \frac{142}{33} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 198:
\[ \frac{142}{33} = \frac{142 \times 6}{33 \times 6} = \frac{852}{198} \]

Convert \( \frac{1}{6} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 198:
\[ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1 \times 33}{6 \times 33} = \frac{33}{198} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{852}{198} - \frac{33}{198} = \frac{852 - 33}{198} = \frac{819}{198} \]

Simplify \( \frac{819}{198} \) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 819 and 198, which is 9:
\[ \frac{819 \div 9}{198 \div 9} = \frac{91}{22} \]

Thus, the amount of apple juice left unused after adding the additional \( \frac{1}{6} \) liters is \( \frac{91}{22} \) liters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many liters of apple juice are left unused, we need to subtract the amount Ralph used from the amount he initially had.

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator to make the subtraction easier. The denominators are 3 and 11. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 11 is 33.

Convert \( \frac{17}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 33:
\[ \frac{17}{3} = \frac{17 \times 11}{3 \times 11} = \frac{187}{33} \]

Convert \( \frac{14}{11} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 33:
\[ \frac{14}{11} = \frac{14 \times 3}{11 \times 3} = \frac{42}{33} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{187}{33} - \frac{42}{33} = \frac{187 - 42}{33} = \frac{145}{33} \]

Thus, the amount of apple juice left unused is \( \frac{145}{33} \) liters.

1. Billy initially travels 4 miles.

\[
\frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ light years}

Next, we know the rocket traveled an additional \( \frac{2}{7} \) light years on the second day.

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from both days:

\[
5 + \frac{2}{7}

To add these, we convert 5 into a fraction with a common denominator of 7:

\[
5 = \frac{35}{7}

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 247:

\[

\[
\frac{16}{19} = \frac{16 \times 13}{19 \times 13} = \frac{208}{247}

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{190}{247} + \frac{208}{247} = \frac{190 + 208}{247} = \frac{398}{247}

Since \( \frac{398}{247} \) is an improper fraction, we can simplify it:

\[
\frac{398}{247} = 1 + \frac{151}{247}

First, we convert \( 1 + \frac{151}{247} \) to a single fraction:
\[
1 + \frac{151}{247} = \frac{247}{247} + \frac{151}{247} = \frac{398}{247}
\]

Next, we need to add \( \frac{398}{247} \) and \( \frac{15}{17} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 247 and 17 is 4199 (since 247 = 13 * 19 and 17 is prime).

We convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 4199:

\[
\frac{398}{247} = \frac{398 \times 17}{247 \times 17} = \frac{6766}{4199}

\[
\frac{15}{17} = \frac{15 \times 247}{17 \times 247} = \frac{3705}{4199}

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{6766}{4199} + \frac{3705}{4199} = \frac{6766 + 3705}{4199} = \frac{10471}{4199}

Since \( \frac{10471}{4199} \) is an improper fraction, we can simplify it:

\[
\frac{10471}{4199} = 2 + \frac{2073}{4199}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify the fractions to make the calculations easier.

For the distance walked North:
\[ \frac{9}{6} = \frac{3 \times 3}{3 \times 2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ miles} \]

For the distance walked East:
\[ \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1 \times 2}{8 \times 2} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the two distances together:
\[ 1.5 \text{ miles} + \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles} \]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 8 is 8.

Convert \(1.5\) to a fraction with a denominator of 8:
\[ 1.5 = \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3 \times 4}{2 \times 4} = \frac{12}{8} \]

Jessica initially has \( \frac{16}{9} \) cubic feet of sand.
She removes \( \frac{4}{13} \) cubic feet of sand.

First, we need to find a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 13 is 117.

Convert \( \frac{16}{9} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 117:
\[ \frac{16}{9} = \frac{16 \times 13}{9 \times 13} = \frac{208}{117} \]

Convert \( \frac{4}{13} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 117:
\[ \frac{4}{13} = \frac{4 \times 9}{13 \times 9} = \frac{36}{117} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{208}{117} - \frac{36}{117} = \frac{208 - 36}{117} = \frac{172}{117} \]

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{172}{117} \):
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 172 and 117 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{172}{117} \) and \( \frac{19}{15} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 117 and 15 is 1755.

Convert \( \frac{172}{117} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 1755:
\[ \frac{172}{117} = \frac{172 \times 15}{117 \times 15} = \frac{2580}{1755} \]

Convert \( \frac{19}{15} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 1755:
\[ \frac{19}{15} = \frac{19 \times 117}{15 \times 117} = \frac{2223}{1755} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{2580}{1755} + \frac{2223}{1755} = \frac{2580 + 2223}{1755} = \frac{4803}{1755} \]

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{4803}{1755} \):
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4803 and 1755 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[ \frac{4803 \div 3}{1755 \div 3} = \frac{1601}{585} \]

Thus, the amount of sand Jessica now has in her sandbox is \( \frac{1601}{585} \) cubic feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much sand Jessica has left in her sandbox, we need to subtract the amount of sand she removed from the total amount of sand she initially had.

Jessica initially has \( \frac{16}{9} \) cubic feet of sand.
She removes \( \frac{4}{8} \) cubic feet of sand.

First, simplify \( \frac{4}{8} \):
\[ \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we need to convert both fractions to have a common denominator to perform the subtraction. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 2 is 18.

Convert \( \frac{16}{9} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 18:
\[ \frac{16}{9} = \frac{16 \times 2}{9 \times 2} = \frac{32}{18} \]

Convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 18:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 9}{2 \times 9} = \frac{9}{18} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{32}{18} - \frac{9}{18} = \frac{32 - 9}{18} = \frac{23}{18} \]

Thus, the amount of sand left in the sandbox is \( \frac{23}{18} \) cubic feet.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fractions if possible.

The first piece of rope is \( \frac{15}{12} \) meters long. We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15 and 12, which is 3:
\[ \frac{15 \div 3}{12 \div 3} = \frac{5}{4} \]

The second piece of rope is \( \frac{17}{17} \) meters long. Since the numerator and the denominator are the same, this fraction simplifies to 1:
\[ \frac{17}{17} = 1 \]

Now, we add the simplified lengths together:
\[ \frac{5}{4} + 1 \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 4 and 1 is 4:
\[ 1 = \frac{4}{4} \]

So, we rewrite the addition as:
\[ \frac{5}{4} + \frac{4}{4} = \frac{5 + 4}{4} = \frac{9}{4} \]

Thus, the total length of the rope is \( \frac{9}{4} \) meters.

To double this length, Jacob will add another piece of rope that is also \( \frac{9}{4} \) meters long.

\[ \frac{9}{4} + \frac{9}{4} \]

Since the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators directly:
\[ \frac{9 + 9}{4} = \frac{18}{4} \]

We can simplify \( \frac{18}{4} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total number of pairs of pants Mark has after his shopping trip, we need to add the pairs he already had to the pairs he bought.

First, let's convert the mixed number \( \frac{13}{4} \) into an improper fraction:

Next, let's convert the mixed number \( \frac{13}{3} \) into an improper fraction:
\[ \frac{13}{3} = 4 \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, we add the full pair (which is 1) to the mixed number \( 3 \frac{1}{4} \):

Next, we add the pairs he bought \( 4 \frac{1}{3} \):
\[ 4 \frac{1}{4} + 4 \frac{1}{3} \]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12.

Convert \( 4 \frac{1}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[ 4 \frac{1}{4} = 4 + \frac{1}{4} = 4 + \frac{3}{12} = 4 \frac{3}{12} \]

Convert \( 4 \frac{1}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[ 4 \frac{1}{3} = 4 + \frac{1}{3} = 4 + \frac{4}{12} = 4 \frac{4}{12} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ 4 \frac{3}{12} + 4 \frac{4}{12} = 4 + \frac{3}{12} + 4 + \frac{4}{12} = 8 + \frac{3}{12} + \frac{4}{12} = 8 + \frac{7}{12} = 8 \frac{7}{12} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. However, since 1 hour can be written as 19/19 hours, we can directly add the fractions:

Now, add the two fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total time Miss Jenny spent between grading papers and organizing her lesson plans, we need to add the time she spent on each activity.

From the previous calculation, we know she spent \( 2 \frac{1}{19} \) hours grading papers. This can be written as an improper fraction:

\[ 2 \frac{1}{19} = \frac{39}{19} \]

She also spent \( \frac{1}{12} \) hours organizing her lesson plans.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 19 and 12 is 228.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 228:

\[ \frac{39}{19} = \frac{39 \times 12}{19 \times 12} = \frac{468}{228} \]

\[ \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1 \times 19}{12 \times 19} = \frac{19}{228} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{468}{228} + \frac{19}{228} = \frac{468 + 19}{228} = \frac{487}{228} \]

Simplify the fraction if possible. In this case, 487 and 228 have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, Miss Jenny spent a total of \( \frac{487}{228} \) hours on both activities.

The initial height of the cloud is given as \( \frac{12}{3} \) kilometers. Simplifying this fraction:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, the cloud ascended by \( \frac{15}{12} \) kilometers. Simplifying this fraction:

Now, we need to add the initial height and the ascended height to find the resultant height:

To add these, we convert 4 into a fraction with the same denominator as \( \frac{5}{4} \):
\[ 4 = \frac{16}{4} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{16}{4} + \frac{5}{4} = \frac{16 + 5}{4} = \frac{21}{4} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we simplify the given fractions to make the calculations easier.

The initial height of the cloud is given as \( \frac{12}{3} \) kilometers. Simplifying this fraction:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, the cloud ascended by \( \frac{7}{12} \) kilometers. 

Now, we need to add the initial height and the ascended height to find the resultant height:
\[ 4 + \frac{7}{12} \]

To add these, we convert 4 into a fraction with the same denominator as \( \frac{7}{12} \):
\[ 4 = \frac{48}{12} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{48}{12} + \frac{7}{12} = \frac{48 + 7}{12} = \frac{55}{12} \]

Converting \( \frac{55}{12} \) back to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{55}{12} = 4 \frac{7}{12} \text{ kilometers} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance Jack rides his scooter, we need to add the two distances together. 

First, let's simplify the fractions if possible:

1. The distance to the library is \( \frac{3}{9} \) of a mile. Simplifying \( \frac{3}{9} \):
   \[
   \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

2. The distance to his grandparents' house is \( \frac{17}{15} \) of a mile. This fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we need to add \( \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \frac{17}{15} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15.

Convert \( \frac{1}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{5}{15}
\]

Now, add \( \frac{5}{15} \) and \( \frac{17}{15} \):
\[
\frac{5}{15} + \frac{17}{15} = \frac{5 + 17}{15} = \frac{22}{15}

Thus, the total distance Jack rides his scooter is \( \frac{22}{15} \) miles.

First, let's simplify the new distance if possible:

1. The distance to the park is \( \frac{20}{12} \) of a mile. Simplifying \( \frac{20}{12} \):
   \[
   \frac{20}{12} = \frac{20 \div 4}{12 \div 4} = \frac{5}{3}
   \]

Next, we need to add \( \frac{22}{15} \) (the previous total distance) and \( \frac{5}{3} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 3 is 15.

Convert \( \frac{5}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[
\frac{5}{3} = \frac{5 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{25}{15}
\]

Now, add \( \frac{22}{15} \) and \( \frac{25}{15} \):
\[
\frac{22}{15} + \frac{25}{15} = \frac{22 + 25}{15} = \frac{47}{15}

2. The distance to his grandparents' house is \( \frac{17}{20} \) of a mile. This fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we need to add \( \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \frac{17}{20} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 20 is 60.

Convert \( \frac{1}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60:
\[
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 20}{3 \times 20} = \frac{20}{60}
\]

Convert \( \frac{17}{20} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60:
\[
\frac{17}{20} = \frac{17 \times 3}{20 \times 3} = \frac{51}{60}

Now, add \( \frac{20}{60} \) and \( \frac{51}{60} \):
\[
\frac{20}{60} + \frac{51}{60} = \frac{20 + 51}{60} = \frac{71}{60}

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the total burn time for the logs. Each log burns for \( \frac{1}{16} \) of an hour, and there are 4 logs. Therefore, the total burn time for the logs is:
\[
4 \times \frac{1}{16} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ hour}
\]

Next, let's determine the total burn time for the twigs. Each twig burns for \( \frac{1}{12} \) of an hour, and there are 16 twigs. Therefore, the total burn time for the twigs is:
\[
16 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{16}{12} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we add the total burn time for the logs and the twigs:
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{4}{3}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12. Converting each fraction to have a denominator of 12, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{12} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12}
\]

Adding these fractions together:
\[
\frac{3}{12} + \frac{16}{12} = \frac{19}{12}

Thus, the total burn time for the logs and twigs is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the total burn time for the charcoal. Each piece of charcoal burns for \( \frac{1}{5} \) of an hour, and there are 8 pieces. Therefore, the total burn time for the charcoal is:
\[
8 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{8}{5} \text{ hours}
\]

Previously, we calculated the total burn time for the logs and twigs as \( \frac{19}{12} \) hours. Now, we need to add the burn time for the charcoal to this total.

To add \( \frac{19}{12} \) and \( \frac{8}{5} \), we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 12 and 5 is 60. Converting each fraction to have a denominator of 60, we get:
\[
\frac{19}{12} = \frac{19 \times 5}{12 \times 5} = \frac{95}{60}
\]
\[
\frac{8}{5} = \frac{8 \times 12}{5 \times 12} = \frac{96}{60}

Adding these fractions together:
\[
\frac{95}{60} + \frac{96}{60} = \frac{191}{60}

Now, we add the total burn time for the logs and the twigs:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fractions and perform the necessary calculations.

1. The amount of silver used for the base of the ring is given as \( \frac{12}{16} \) ounces. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
   \[
   \frac{12}{16} = \frac{12 \div 4}{16 \div 4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ ounces}

2. The amount of silver used for the rest of the ring is given as \( \frac{16}{2} \) ounces. We can simplify this fraction by performing the division:
   \[

3. To find the total amount of silver used, we add the two amounts together:

1. We previously calculated that the ring maker used \( \frac{35}{4} \) ounces of silver for the base and the rest of the ring.

2. The additional silver required for the ornamental filigree is \( \frac{18}{20} \) ounces. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

3. To add \( \frac{35}{4} \) ounces and \( \frac{9}{10} \) ounces, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 10 is 20.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of bushels of apples produced by the tree, we need to add the bushels produced in the morning and the afternoon.

The tree produced \( \frac{10}{11} \) bushels in the morning and \( \frac{17}{11} \) bushels in the afternoon.

First, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{10}{11} + \frac{17}{11}
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators directly:
\[
\frac{10 + 17}{11} = \frac{27}{11}
\]

Thus, the tree produced \( \frac{27}{11} \) bushels of apples in total.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of bushels of apples produced by the tree in one day, we need to add the bushels produced in the morning and the afternoon.

The tree produced \( \frac{10}{9} \) bushels in the morning and \( \frac{17}{11} \) bushels in the afternoon.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 11 is 99.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 99:
\[
\frac{10}{9} = \frac{10 \times 11}{9 \times 11} = \frac{110}{99}
\]
\[
\frac{17}{11} = \frac{17 \times 9}{11 \times 9} = \frac{153}{99}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{110}{99} + \frac{153}{99} = \frac{110 + 153}{99} = \frac{263}{99}

Thus, the tree produced \( \frac{263}{99} \) bushels of apples in one day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the combined range increase when Sam and Joe use their binoculars one after the other, we need to add the range increases provided by each of their binoculars.

Sam's binoculars increase his range of sight by \( \frac{3}{14} \) of a mile.
Joe's binoculars increase his range of sight by 1 mile, which can be expressed as \( \frac{16}{16} \) of a mile.

First, we need to add these two fractions:
\[ \frac{3}{14} + \frac{16}{16} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 14 and 16 is 112. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{3}{14} = \frac{3 \times 8}{14 \times 8} = \frac{24}{112} \]
\[ \frac{16}{16} = \frac{16 \times 7}{16 \times 7} = \frac{112}{112} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{24}{112} + \frac{112}{112} = \frac{24 + 112}{112} = \frac{136}{112} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8:
\[ \frac{136 \div 8}{112 \div 8} = \frac{17}{14} \]

Thus, the combined range increase when Sam and Joe use their binoculars one after the other is \( \frac{17}{14} \) miles.

Sam's binoculars now increase his range of sight by \( \frac{4}{14} \) of a mile.

First, we need to add these two fractions:
\[ \frac{4}{14} + \frac{16}{16} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 14 and 16 is 112. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 16:

Now, we need to add the two fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6.

Convert \(\frac{3}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:

Convert \(\frac{1}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:
\[ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 2}{3 \times 2} = \frac{2}{6} \]

Now, add the two fractions:

To find the net distance from the starting point, we subtract the backward distance from the forward distance:

\[ \frac{126}{77} + \frac{11}{77} = \frac{126 + 11}{77} = \frac{137}{77} \]

Thus, the total amount of paint used is \( \frac{137}{77} \) liters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the total number of tasks executed by the computer program. 

The program executed:
- 8 tasks in the first 4 minutes
- 20 tasks in the next 14 minutes

Total tasks executed:
\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

Next, we find the total time taken:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} + 14 \text{ minutes} = 18 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate the average number of tasks executed per minute:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ tasks}}{18 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{14}{9} \approx 1.56 \text{ tasks per minute} \]

            At the end of a rainbow, there are pots filled with magical gold coins. One pot contains 12/13 of a pound of gold coins while another contains 3/2 pounds of gold coins. How much gold is there in total?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of gold in the two pots, we need to add the fractions representing the weights of the gold coins.

First, let's write down the fractions:
- The first pot contains \( \frac{12}{13} \) pounds of gold.
- The second pot contains \( \frac{3}{2} \) pounds of gold.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 13 and 2. The least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 2 is 26.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 26:
- For \( \frac{12}{13} \):
  \[
  \frac{12}{13} = \frac{12 \times 2}{13 \times 2} = \frac{24}{26}
  \]

- For \( \frac{3}{2} \):
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3 \times 13}{2 \times 13} = \frac{39}{26}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{24}{26} + \frac{39}{26} = \frac{24 + 39}{26} = \frac{63}{26}
\]

The fraction \( \frac{63}{26} \) can be simplified to a mixed number:
\[
\frac{63}{26} = 2 \frac{11}{26}
\]

Thus, the total amount of gold in the two pots is \( 2 \frac{11}{26} \) pounds.

Now, we add these two lengths together:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} + \frac{7}{8} \text{ hours} \]

To add these, we can convert 12 hours to a fraction with a common denominator of 8:
\[ 12 = \frac{96}{8} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{96}{8} + \frac{7}{8} = \frac{96 + 7}{8} = \frac{103}{8} \]

The distance between Town A and Town B is given as \( \frac{15}{11} \) inches.
The distance between Town B and Town C is given as \( \frac{16}{15} \) inches.

First, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 15 is 165.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 165:

\[
\frac{15}{11} = \frac{15 \times 15}{11 \times 15} = \frac{225}{165}

\[
\frac{16}{15} = \frac{16 \times 11}{15 \times 11} = \frac{176}{165}

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{225}{165} + \frac{176}{165} = \frac{225 + 176}{165} = \frac{401}{165}

First, simplify the distance between Town C and Town D:
\[

Next, we need to add these distances together. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{15}{11} \) and \( \frac{16}{15} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 15 is 165.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 165:

\[
4 = \frac{4 \times 165}{1 \times 165} = \frac{660}{165}
\]

Now, add this to the previous sum:

\[
\frac{401}{165} + \frac{660}{165} = \frac{401 + 660}{165} = \frac{1061}{165}
\]

Thus, the total distance between Town A and Town D on the map is \( \frac{1061}{165} \) inches.

The distance between Town A and Town B is given as \( \frac{15}{11} \) inches.
The distance between Town B and Town C is given as \( \frac{16}{7} \) inches.

First, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 7 is 77.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 77:

\[
\frac{15}{11} = \frac{15 \times 7}{11 \times 7} = \frac{105}{77}
\]

\[
\frac{16}{7} = \frac{16 \times 11}{7 \times 11} = \frac{176}{77}

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{105}{77} + \frac{176}{77} = \frac{105 + 176}{77} = \frac{281}{77}

\[ \frac{13}{18} + \frac{2}{3} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 3 is 18. We can convert \(\frac{2}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 18:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the current total daily production of soap.

We already know from the previous problem that:
\[ \frac{13}{18} \text{ tons of Soap A} + \frac{4}{6} \text{ tons of Soap B} \]

We simplified \(\frac{4}{6}\) to \(\frac{2}{3}\), and then found a common denominator to add the fractions:
\[ \frac{13}{18} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{13}{18} + \frac{12}{18} = \frac{25}{18} \text{ tons} \]

Now, if the company plans to double their daily production, we need to multiply the total amount by 2:
\[ 2 \times \frac{25}{18} = \frac{2 \times 25}{18} = \frac{50}{18} \]

We can simplify \(\frac{50}{18}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[ \frac{50 \div 2}{18 \div 2} = \frac{25}{9} \]

So, when the company doubles their production, they will produce:

Now, subtract \( \frac{13}{12} \) from \( \frac{114}{12} \):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify the fractions if possible.

For the monkeys:
\[ \frac{6}{20} \]
We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6 and 20, which is 2.
\[ \frac{6 \div 2}{20 \div 2} = \frac{3}{10} \]

For the giraffes:
\[ \frac{18}{15} \]
We can simplify this fraction by finding the GCD of 18 and 15, which is 3.
\[ \frac{18 \div 3}{15 \div 3} = \frac{6}{5} \]

Next, we need to add the two fractions together. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 5 is 10.

Convert \(\frac{6}{5}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 10:

Now, add the two fractions:

Simplify \(\frac{15}{10}\):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of silver the jeweler has, we need to add the two fractions: \( \frac{5}{14} \) and \( \frac{18}{19} \).

First, we need a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 14 and 19 is 266.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{5}{14} = \frac{5 \times 19}{14 \times 19} = \frac{95}{266} \]
\[ \frac{18}{19} = \frac{18 \times 14}{19 \times 14} = \frac{252}{266} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{95}{266} + \frac{252}{266} = \frac{95 + 252}{266} = \frac{347}{266} \]

Since \( \frac{347}{266} \) is an improper fraction, we can convert it to a mixed number if needed. However, in this context, the improper fraction is sufficient to represent the total amount of silver.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the total distance the turtle moves northward. The turtle moves 11 meters northward.

Next, the turtle moves 15/15 of a meter back towards the starting point. Since 15/15 is equivalent to 1, the turtle moves 1 meter back.

To find the turtle's final position relative to the starting point, we subtract the distance it moved back from the distance it moved northward:

Next, the turtle moves 15/8 of a meter back towards the starting point. 

To find the turtle's final position relative to the starting point, we subtract the distance it moved back from the distance it moved northward:
\[ 11 \text{ meters} - \frac{15}{8} \text{ meters} \]

First, convert 11 meters to a fraction with a common denominator of 8:
\[ 11 = \frac{88}{8} \]

Now, perform the subtraction:
\[ \frac{88}{8} - \frac{15}{8} = \frac{88 - 15}{8} = \frac{73}{8} \]

To convert \(\frac{73}{8}\) back to a decimal or mixed number:

Convert 1 ounce to a fraction with a denominator of 14:

Now, add \( \frac{14}{14} \) and \( \frac{4}{14} \):

Next, we need to add this capacity to the original capacity of the backpack, which is \( \frac{20}{9} \) liters. To find the total capacity, we add these two quantities:

The current total capacity of the backpack is \( \frac{38}{9} \) liters, and the tiny side pocket can carry an additional \( \frac{3}{8} \) liters.

To add these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 8 is 72. We will convert both fractions to have this common denominator.

First, convert \( \frac{38}{9} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 72:

\[ \frac{38}{9} = \frac{38 \times 8}{9 \times 8} = \frac{304}{72} \]

Next, convert \( \frac{3}{8} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 72:

\[ \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 9}{8 \times 9} = \frac{27}{72} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:

\[ \frac{304}{72} + \frac{27}{72} = \frac{304 + 27}{72} = \frac{331}{72} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total weight of the gold Captain Hook now has, we need to add the two amounts of gold together.

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator if necessary. In this case, the denominators are already compatible for addition.

The fractions are:
\[ \frac{11}{8} \]
\[ \frac{5}{5} \]

Since \(\frac{5}{5}\) is equivalent to 1, we can rewrite the problem as:
\[ \frac{11}{8} + 1 \]

To add these, we need to express 1 as a fraction with a denominator of 8:
\[ 1 = \frac{8}{8} \]

Now we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{11}{8} + \frac{8}{8} = \frac{11 + 8}{8} = \frac{19}{8} \]

So, the total weight of the gold Captain Hook now has is:
\[ \frac{19}{8} \] ounces.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator to make the addition easier. 

Jake originally had \( \frac{9}{10} \) of a dollar.

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{20}{15} \):
\[ \frac{20}{15} = \frac{20 \div 5}{15 \div 5} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, we need to add \( \frac{9}{10} \) and \( \frac{4}{3} \). To do this, we find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 3 is 30.

Convert \( \frac{9}{10} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 30:
\[ \frac{9}{10} = \frac{9 \times 3}{10 \times 3} = \frac{27}{30} \]

Convert \( \frac{4}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 30:
\[ \frac{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 10}{3 \times 10} = \frac{40}{30} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{27}{30} + \frac{40}{30} = \frac{27 + 40}{30} = \frac{67}{30} \]

Thus, Jake has \( \frac{67}{30} \) dollars in his wallet.

Now, Jake found an additional \( \frac{11}{5} \) of a dollar. To add these two amounts, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 30 and 5 is 30.

Convert \( \frac{11}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 30:
\[ \frac{11}{5} = \frac{11 \times 6}{5 \times 6} = \frac{66}{30} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{67}{30} + \frac{66}{30} = \frac{67 + 66}{30} = \frac{133}{30} \]

Convert \( \frac{4}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 24:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fraction \( \frac{12}{9} \). We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 9, which is 3.

\[
\frac{12}{9} = \frac{12 \div 3}{9 \div 3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many shirts John donated. He originally had 5 shirts, and he donated \( \frac{4}{3} \) of them. To find out how many shirts this is, we multiply:

\[
5 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{5 \times 4}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67
\]

Since John cannot donate a fraction of a shirt, we need to consider that donating \( \frac{4}{3} \) of his shirts is not feasible. This suggests there might be an error in the problem's setup, as donating more shirts than he has is not possible.

However, if we assume the problem meant to donate a fraction of the shirts he has, we can interpret it as donating a part of each shirt, which is not practical in real life. Therefore, we should re-evaluate the problem's context or consider it as a theoretical exercise.

Given the context, if John donated \( \frac{4}{3} \) of his shirts, he would have:

\[
5 - \frac{20}{3} = 5 - 6.67 \approx -1.67
\]

Since this is not possible, we conclude that the problem might have an error. If we consider a more realistic scenario, John cannot donate more shirts than he has.

1. The original length of the jacket is \( \frac{14}{3} \) meters.

First, let's simplify \( \frac{14}{16} \):
\[ \frac{14}{16} = \frac{7}{8} \]

Now, we need to subtract \( \frac{7}{8} \) from \( \frac{14}{3} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 8 is 24.

Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 24:
\[ \frac{14}{3} = \frac{14 \times 8}{3 \times 8} = \frac{112}{24} \]
\[ \frac{7}{8} = \frac{7 \times 3}{8 \times 3} = \frac{21}{24} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:

            Initially, Bob's jacket was 16/3 meters in length instead of 14/3 meters. If he still cuts off 14/16 meter from this new original length, then what would be the length of Bob's jacket after the alteration now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new length of Bob's jacket after the alteration, we need to subtract the length he cut off from the new original length.

1. The new original length of the jacket is \( \frac{16}{3} \) meters.
2. The length he cut off is \( \frac{14}{16} \) meters, which simplifies to \( \frac{7}{8} \) meters.

First, let's convert both fractions to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 8 is 24.

Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 24:
\[ \frac{16}{3} = \frac{16 \times 8}{3 \times 8} = \frac{128}{24} \]
\[ \frac{7}{8} = \frac{7 \times 3}{8 \times 3} = \frac{21}{24} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{128}{24} - \frac{21}{24} = \frac{128 - 21}{24} = \frac{107}{24} \]

So, the length of Bob's jacket after the alteration is \( \frac{107}{24} \) meters.

First, simplify \( \frac{10}{12} \):

Next, find a common denominator for \( \frac{5}{6} \) and \( \frac{3}{8} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8 is 24.

Convert \( \frac{5}{6} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 24:

Convert \( \frac{3}{8} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 24:

Now, add the two fractions:

First, simplify \( \frac{10}{12} \):
\[ \frac{10}{12} = \frac{5}{6} \]

Next, find a common denominator for \( \frac{5}{6} \) and \( \frac{3}{8} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8 is 24.

Now, add the two fractions for one routine:

Since John repeated this routine, we need to double the time:

Convert \( \frac{58}{24} \) to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{58}{24} = 2 \frac{10}{24} \]

Simplify \( \frac{10}{24} \):

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator to make the addition easier. The denominators are 3 and 13. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 13 is 39.

Convert \( \frac{5}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 39:

Convert \( \frac{10}{13} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 39:

From the previous calculation, we know that the time to build the frame and upholster it is \( \frac{95}{39} \) hours.

Now, we need to add the time to apply the varnish, which is \( \frac{8}{19} \) hours.

First, let's convert \( \frac{8}{19} \) to a fraction with a common denominator with \( \frac{95}{39} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 39 and 19 is 741.

Convert \( \frac{95}{39} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 741:
\[ \frac{95}{39} = \frac{95 \times 19}{39 \times 19} = \frac{1805}{741} \]

Convert \( \frac{8}{19} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 741:
\[ \frac{8}{19} = \frac{8 \times 39}{19 \times 39} = \frac{312}{741} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{1805}{741} + \frac{312}{741} = \frac{1805 + 312}{741} = \frac{2117}{741} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total time Mr. Carpenter takes to build a chair with the new time for frame construction, we need to add the time he spends building the frame to the time he spends upholstering it.

First, let's simplify the fraction for the new time to build the frame:
\[ \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, we need to add this time to the time he spends upholstering the chair, which is \( \frac{10}{13} \).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 13. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 13 is 26.

Convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 26:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 13}{2 \times 13} = \frac{13}{26} \]

Convert \( \frac{10}{13} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 26:
\[ \frac{10}{13} = \frac{10 \times 2}{13 \times 2} = \frac{20}{26} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{13}{26} + \frac{20}{26} = \frac{13 + 20}{26} = \frac{33}{26} \]

To simplify \( \frac{33}{26} \), we can perform the division:
\[ 33 \div 26 \approx 1.26923077 \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Mr. Carpenter to build a chair with the new time for frame construction is \( \frac{33}{26} \) hours.

Next, let's determine the diameter of the large bead. The large bead has a diameter of \( \frac{15}{2} \) mm.

\[
\frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \text{ mm}
\]

Now, we add the diameters of the small and large beads to find the total added diameter.

\[
2 \text{ mm} + 7.5 \text{ mm} = 9.5 \text{ mm}
\]

### Answer: 9.5 mm</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the distance the rocket travels towards the distant star. The given distance is \( \frac{8}{2} \) light-years.

\[
\frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ light-years}
\]

Next, we add the distances traveled to the alien planet and towards the distant star:

\[
\frac{11}{18} \text{ light-years} + 4 \text{ light-years}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 18 and 1 is 18. We convert 4 light-years to a fraction with a denominator of 18:

\[
4 = \frac{4 \times 18}{1 \times 18} = \frac{72}{18}
\]

Now, we add the fractions:

\[
\frac{11}{18} + \frac{72}{18} = \frac{11 + 72}{18} = \frac{83}{18}

Thus, the total distance covered by the rocket is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance covered by the rocket, we need to add the distances traveled to the alien planet and towards the distant star. The distances are \( \frac{11}{18} \) light-years and \( \frac{8}{13} \) light-years, respectively.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{11}{18} \) and \( \frac{8}{13} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 13 is 234.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 234:

\[
\frac{11}{18} = \frac{11 \times 13}{18 \times 13} = \frac{143}{234}
\]

\[
\frac{8}{13} = \frac{8 \times 18}{13 \times 18} = \frac{144}{234}
\]

Now, we add the fractions:

\[
\frac{143}{234} + \frac{144}{234} = \frac{143 + 144}{234} = \frac{287}{234}

First, simplify \( \frac{12}{14} \):

Next, we need a common denominator to add \( \frac{6}{7} \) and \( \frac{8}{5} \). The least common multiple of 7 and 5 is 35.

Convert \( \frac{6}{7} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 35:

Johnathan bought 17 yards of fabric in total. He used \( 2 \frac{16}{35} \) yards for the sleeping bag.

First, convert \( 2 \frac{16}{35} \) to an improper fraction:
\[ 2 \frac{16}{35} = \frac{2 \times 35 + 16}{35} = \frac{70 + 16}{35} = \frac{86}{35} \]

Next, convert 17 yards to a fraction with the same denominator (35):
\[ 17 = \frac{17 \times 35}{35} = \frac{595}{35} \]

Now, subtract the fabric used from the total fabric bought:
\[ \frac{595}{35} - \frac{86}{35} = \frac{595 - 86}{35} = \frac{509}{35} \]

Convert the improper fraction \( \frac{509}{35} \) to a mixed number:

\[
\frac{4}{16} = \frac{4 \div 4}{16 \div 4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Now, we need to subtract \( \frac{1}{4} \) from \( \frac{13}{7} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 4 is 28. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

- The second fraction is \( \frac{2}{14} \). We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

            At a park, a special tree produces on average 10/4 kilograms of fruit every summer. In the winter, it loses some of its fruit, amounting to 12/20 kg. What is the difference in kilograms of the fruit from summer to winter?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the amount of fruit produced in the summer. The tree produces:

\[
\frac{10}{4} \text{ kilograms}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of fruit lost in the winter. The tree loses:

\[
\frac{12}{20} \text{ kilograms}
\]

To find the difference in kilograms of the fruit from summer to winter, we subtract the amount lost in winter from the amount produced in summer. First, we need to simplify both fractions.

\[
\frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \text{ kilograms}
\]

\[
\frac{12}{20} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \text{ kilograms}
\]

Now, subtract the winter loss from the summer production:

\[
2.5 - 0.6 = 1.9 \text{ kilograms}
\]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new length of the ballerina's routine after shortening it, we need to subtract the time she shortened from the original routine time.

First, let's convert both fractions to have a common denominator so we can subtract them easily. The denominators are 5 and 16. The least common multiple of 5 and 16 is 80.

Convert \( \frac{13}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 80:
\[ \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13 \times 16}{5 \times 16} = \frac{208}{80} \]

Convert \( \frac{15}{16} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 80:
\[ \frac{15}{16} = \frac{15 \times 5}{16 \times 5} = \frac{75}{80} \]

Now, subtract \( \frac{75}{80} \) from \( \frac{208}{80} \):
\[ \frac{208}{80} - \frac{75}{80} = \frac{208 - 75}{80} = \frac{133}{80} \]

The annual increase in distance is:

Simplifying \(\frac{4}{16}\):

The additional increase this year is:
\[ \frac{20}{6} \]
Simplifying \(\frac{20}{6}\):
\[ \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the total change in distance this year by adding these two fractions:

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{10}{3} = \frac{10 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{40}{12} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{3}{12} + \frac{40}{12} = \frac{3 + 40}{12} = \frac{43}{12} \]

The additional predicted increase for the coming year is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of money Bob has in his wallet, we need to add the two fractions together: \(\frac{11}{3}\) and \(\frac{12}{19}\).

First, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 19 is 57.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 57:
\[
\frac{11}{3} = \frac{11 \times 19}{3 \times 19} = \frac{209}{57}
\]
\[
\frac{12}{19} = \frac{12 \times 3}{19 \times 3} = \frac{36}{57}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{209}{57} + \frac{36}{57} = \frac{209 + 36}{57} = \frac{245}{57}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{245}{57}\), we check if there is a common factor between 245 and 57. Since there is no common factor other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the total amount of money Bob has in his wallet is \(\frac{245}{57}\) dollars.

            Bob has 11/3 dollars in one pocket of his wallet and 12/19 dollars in another pocket. How much money does he have in total in his wallet? Now, if Bob duplicates the total amount of money in his wallet, how much money will he have then?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the total amount of money Bob has in his wallet by adding the two fractions: \(\frac{11}{3}\) and \(\frac{12}{19}\).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 19 is 57.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 57:
\[
\frac{11}{3} = \frac{11 \times 19}{3 \times 19} = \frac{209}{57}
\]
\[
\frac{12}{19} = \frac{12 \times 3}{19 \times 3} = \frac{36}{57}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{209}{57} + \frac{36}{57} = \frac{209 + 36}{57} = \frac{245}{57}
\]

Next, if Bob duplicates the total amount of money in his wallet, we need to multiply the total by 2:
\[
2 \times \frac{245}{57} = \frac{2 \times 245}{57} = \frac{490}{57}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{490}{57}\), we check if there is a common factor between 490 and 57. Since there is no common factor other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the total amount of money Bob will have after duplicating is \(\frac{490}{57}\) dollars.

First, we recognize that \(\frac{3}{3}\) is equivalent to 1. So, we need to add 1 dollar to \(\frac{12}{19}\) dollars.

To add these, we convert 1 to a fraction with the same denominator as \(\frac{12}{19}\):

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify the fractions to make the calculations easier.

The distance the shark swims in the morning is:
\[ \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ mile} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction for the distance swum in the afternoon:
\[ \frac{12}{18} \]
We can simplify this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 18, which is 6:
\[ \frac{12 \div 6}{18 \div 6} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances swum in the morning and the afternoon:
\[ 1 + \frac{2}{3} \]

To add these, we convert 1 to a fraction with the same denominator as \(\frac{2}{3}\):
\[ 1 = \frac{3}{3} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{3}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{3 + 2}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \]

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify the fraction for the distance swum in the evening:
\[ \frac{18}{9} \]
We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9:
\[ \frac{18 \div 9}{9 \div 9} = \frac{2}{1} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

From the previous problem, we know the shark swam a total of \(1 \frac{2}{3}\) miles in the morning and afternoon. We can convert this mixed number to an improper fraction for easier addition:
\[ 1 \frac{2}{3} = \frac{3}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we add the distance swum in the evening:
\[ \frac{5}{3} + 2 \]

To add these, we convert 2 to a fraction with the same denominator as \(\frac{5}{3}\):
\[ 2 = \frac{6}{3} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{5}{3} + \frac{6}{3} = \frac{5 + 6}{3} = \frac{11}{3} \]

Finally, we convert \(\frac{11}{3}\) to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{11}{3} = 3 \frac{2}{3} \]

The distance the shark swims in the morning is:
\[ \frac{5}{12} \text{ miles} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction for the distance swum in the afternoon:

We can simplify this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 18, which is 6:
\[ \frac{12 \div 6}{18 \div 6} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to add the distances swum in the morning and the afternoon:
\[ \frac{5}{12} + \frac{2}{3} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 3 is 12. We convert \(\frac{2}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{8}{12} \]

Now, we add the fractions:

For Jim:
Jim types 20 words in 16 seconds.
To find his typing speed in words per second, we divide the number of words by the number of seconds:

For Mary:
Mary types 9 words in 4 seconds.
To find her typing speed in words per second, we divide the number of words by the number of seconds:
\[ \text{Mary's typing speed} = \frac{9 \text{ words}}{4 \text{ seconds}} = 2.25 \text{ words per second} \]

To find the total typing speed of both Jim and Mary combined, we add their individual typing speeds:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many miles Max rode his scooter in the afternoon, we need to subtract 1/9 miles from the distance he rode in the morning.

First, let's convert the morning distance into a fraction with a common denominator with 1/9. The morning distance is 9/7 miles.

To subtract 1/9 from 9/7, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 9 is 63.

Convert 9/7 to a fraction with a denominator of 63:
\[ 9/7 = \frac{9 \times 9}{7 \times 9} = \frac{81}{63} \]

Convert 1/9 to a fraction with a denominator of 63:
\[ 1/9 = \frac{1 \times 7}{9 \times 7} = \frac{7}{63} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{81}{63} - \frac{7}{63} = \frac{81 - 7}{63} = \frac{74}{63} \]

To subtract 1/4 from 9/7, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 4 is 28.

First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The denominators are 8 and 10. The least common multiple of 8 and 10 is 40.

Convert \( \frac{9}{8} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:

Convert \( \frac{2}{10} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many hours remained after the clown's performance time is subtracted from her total break time, we need to subtract the performance time from the break time.

The performance time is \( 1 \frac{13}{40} \) hours, which can be converted to an improper fraction:
\[ 1 \frac{13}{40} = \frac{40}{40} + \frac{13}{40} = \frac{53}{40} \]

The break time is \( \frac{13}{5} \) hours. To subtract these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 40 and 5. The least common multiple of 40 and 5 is 40.

Convert \( \frac{13}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:

Now, subtract the performance time from the break time:

Convert the improper fraction \( \frac{51}{40} \) to a mixed number:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total time the clown performed with the updated juggling time, we need to add the time she spent riding the unicycle and the new time she spent juggling.

First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The denominators are 8 and 10. The least common multiple of 8 and 10 is 40.

Convert \( \frac{9}{8} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:
\[ \frac{9}{8} = \frac{9 \times 5}{8 \times 5} = \frac{45}{40} \]

Convert \( \frac{9}{10} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:
\[ \frac{9}{10} = \frac{9 \times 4}{10 \times 4} = \frac{36}{40} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{45}{40} + \frac{36}{40} = \frac{45 + 36}{40} = \frac{81}{40} \]

Convert the improper fraction \( \frac{81}{40} \) to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{81}{40} = 2 \frac{1}{40} \]

So, the total time the clown performed is \( 2 \frac{1}{40} \) hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of ingredients used, we need to add the two fractions: \( \frac{18}{8} \) and \( \frac{11}{7} \).

First, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 8 and 7. The least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 7 is 56.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 56:

\[
\frac{18}{8} = \frac{18 \times 7}{8 \times 7} = \frac{126}{56}
\]

\[
\frac{11}{7} = \frac{11 \times 8}{7 \times 8} = \frac{88}{56}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{126}{56} + \frac{88}{56} = \frac{126 + 88}{56} = \frac{214}{56}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{214}{56} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 214 and 56, which is 2:

\[

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance the UFO traveled, we need to add the two distances together. First, let's convert both fractions to have a common denominator.

The fractions are:
\[ \frac{3}{10} \]
\[ \frac{16}{20} \]

We can simplify \(\frac{16}{20}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
\[ \frac{16 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{4}{5} \]

Next, we need a common denominator for \(\frac{3}{10}\) and \(\frac{4}{5}\). The least common multiple of 10 and 5 is 10. We can convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 10:
\[ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4 \times 2}{5 \times 2} = \frac{8}{10} \]

Now we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{3}{10} + \frac{8}{10} = \frac{3 + 8}{10} = \frac{11}{10} \]

The total distance the UFO traveled is \(\frac{11}{10}\) miles, which can also be expressed as 1.1 miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how many chairs the first machine makes in one hour. The first machine makes \( \frac{4}{14} \) of a chair every hour. We can simplify this fraction:

\[
\frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}
\]

So, the first machine makes \( \frac{2}{7} \) of a chair every hour.

Next, let's determine how many chairs the second machine makes in one hour. The second machine makes \( \frac{20}{4} \) chairs every hour. Simplifying this fraction:

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, the second machine makes 5 chairs every hour.

To find the total number of chairs made by both machines in one hour, we add the number of chairs made by each machine:

\[
\frac{2}{7} + 5
\]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7. Converting 5 to a fraction with a denominator of 7:

\[
5 = \frac{35}{7}
\]

Now, we can add the fractions:

\[
\frac{2}{7} + \frac{35}{7} = \frac{2 + 35}{7} = \frac{37}{7}

To find the total number of chairs made by both machines in one hour, we add the number of chairs made by each machine:

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 14 and 1 is 14. Converting 5 to a fraction with a denominator of 14:

From the previous problem, we know that the blue shark and the hammerhead shark swam a combined distance of \( \frac{6}{5} \) miles.

Now, we need to add the distance swum by the great white shark, which is \( \frac{9}{14} \) miles.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{6}{5} \) and \( \frac{9}{14} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 14 is 70.

Convert \( \frac{6}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 70:

Convert \( \frac{9}{14} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 70:
\[ \frac{9}{14} = \frac{9 \times 5}{14 \times 5} = \frac{45}{70} \]

Now, add the two fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance swum by both sharks, we need to add the distances they swam.

First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The denominators are 4 and 11. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 11 is 44.

Convert \( \frac{2}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 44:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{2 \times 11}{4 \times 11} = \frac{22}{44} \]

Convert \( \frac{7}{11} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 44:
\[ \frac{7}{11} = \frac{7 \times 4}{11 \times 4} = \frac{28}{44} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{22}{44} + \frac{28}{44} = \frac{22 + 28}{44} = \frac{50}{44} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{50}{44} = \frac{50 \div 2}{44 \div 2} = \frac{25}{22} \]

Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{25}{22} = 1 \frac{3}{22} \]

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator to make the addition easier. However, in this case, it might be simpler to convert the fractions to decimals.

1. Convert \( \frac{8}{18} \) to a decimal:
\[ \frac{8}{18} = 0.4444\ldots \approx 0.44 \]

2. Convert \( \frac{18}{8} \) to a decimal:
\[ \frac{18}{8} = 2.25 \]

Now, add the two quantities together:
\[ 0.44 + 2.25 = 2.69 \]

\[
\frac{12}{6} = 2 \text{ feet}

Next, we need to consider the growth of the tree due to its natural growth rate, which is \( \frac{1}{10} \) of its height every month. However, since the problem does not specify the initial height of the tree, we will focus on the given additional growth.

Therefore, the total growth of the tree this month is the sum of its natural growth and the additional growth due to the fertilizer. Since the natural growth rate is not specified in terms of the tree's height, we only consider the additional growth:

First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The denominators are 11 and 20. The least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 20 is 220.

Convert \( \frac{13}{11} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 220:

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{260}{220} + \frac{88}{220} = \frac{260 + 88}{220} = \frac{348}{220} \]

Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 348 and 220. The GCD of 348 and 220 is 4.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{348 \div 4}{220 \div 4} = \frac{87}{55} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the distances Captain Jack needs to travel in each direction.

To the East:
\[ \frac{17}{20} \text{ km} \]

To the North:
\[ \frac{15}{3} \text{ km} = 5 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add these distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \frac{17}{20} \text{ km} + 5 \text{ km} \]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 20 and 1 is 20. So, we convert 5 km to a fraction with a denominator of 20:
\[ 5 \text{ km} = \frac{5 \times 20}{1 \times 20} = \frac{100}{20} \text{ km} \]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{17}{20} \text{ km} + \frac{100}{20} \text{ km} = \frac{17 + 100}{20} \text{ km} = \frac{117}{20} \text{ km} \]

Sarah collected \( \frac{11}{20} \) pounds of firewood.
Alex collected \( \frac{9}{7} \) pounds of firewood.

First, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 7 is 140.

Convert \( \frac{11}{20} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 140:

Convert \( \frac{9}{7} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 140:
\[ \frac{9}{7} = \frac{9 \times 20}{7 \times 20} = \frac{180}{140} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{77}{140} + \frac{180}{140} = \frac{77 + 180}{140} = \frac{257}{140} \]

Simplify the fraction if possible. In this case, \( \frac{257}{140} \) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance Captain Bill sailed north, we need to add the two distances together. First, let's convert both fractions to have a common denominator.

The fractions are:
\[ \frac{19}{5} \]
\[ \frac{12}{15} \]

The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 15 is 15. We need to convert \(\frac{19}{5}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 15.

\[ \frac{19}{5} = \frac{19 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{57}{15} \]

Now we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{57}{15} + \frac{12}{15} = \frac{57 + 12}{15} = \frac{69}{15} \]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{69}{15}\). Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

\[ \frac{69 \div 3}{15 \div 3} = \frac{23}{5} \]

So, Captain Bill sailed a total of \(\frac{23}{5}\) miles north.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how far Captain Bill was from his original starting point after backtracking, we need to subtract the distance he traveled south from the total distance he traveled north.

From the previous calculation, we know Captain Bill traveled \(\frac{23}{5}\) miles north. He then traveled \(\frac{20}{17}\) miles south.

First, we need to find a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 17 is 85.

Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 85:
\[ \frac{23}{5} = \frac{23 \times 17}{5 \times 17} = \frac{391}{85} \]
\[ \frac{20}{17} = \frac{20 \times 5}{17 \times 5} = \frac{100}{85} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{391}{85} - \frac{100}{85} = \frac{391 - 100}{85} = \frac{291}{85} \]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{291}{85}\). Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 (since 291 and 85 have no common factors other than 1).

So, Captain Bill is \(\frac{291}{85}\) miles away from his original starting point.

First, we need to convert both fractions to have a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 15 is 90. We will convert each fraction to have a denominator of 90.

For \(\frac{19}{18}\):
\[ \frac{19}{18} = \frac{19 \times 5}{18 \times 5} = \frac{95}{90} \]

For \(\frac{12}{15}\):
\[ \frac{12}{15} = \frac{12 \times 6}{15 \times 6} = \frac{72}{90} \]

Now we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{95}{90} + \frac{72}{90} = \frac{95 + 72}{90} = \frac{167}{90} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total weight of the two types of meat per sandwich, we need to add the fractions representing the weight of the ham and the turkey.

The weights given are:
- Ham: \( \frac{19}{17} \) pounds
- Turkey: \( \frac{9}{4} \) pounds

First, we need a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 4 is 68.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 68:
\[ \frac{19}{17} = \frac{19 \times 4}{17 \times 4} = \frac{76}{68} \]
\[ \frac{9}{4} = \frac{9 \times 17}{4 \times 17} = \frac{153}{68} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{76}{68} + \frac{153}{68} = \frac{76 + 153}{68} = \frac{229}{68} \]

Thus, the total weight of the two types of meat per sandwich is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the intended weight of the meat in the sandwich, we need to subtract the excess amount of meat used from the total weight of the meat actually used.

From the previous problem, we know the total weight of the meat used is:
\[ \frac{229}{68} \text{ pounds} \]

The excess amount of meat used is:
\[ \frac{13}{9} \text{ pounds} \]

First, we need a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 68 and 9 is 612.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 612:
\[ \frac{229}{68} = \frac{229 \times 9}{68 \times 9} = \frac{2061}{612} \]
\[ \frac{13}{9} = \frac{13 \times 68}{9 \times 68} = \frac{884}{612} \]

Now, subtract the excess amount from the total weight:
\[ \frac{2061}{612} - \frac{884}{612} = \frac{2061 - 884}{612} = \frac{1177}{612} \]

Thus, the weight of the meat that should have been in the sandwich is:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total length of Lucy's sleeping bag after adding the extension, we need to add the original length of the sleeping bag to the length of the extension.

The original length of the sleeping bag is \( \frac{18}{19} \) meters.
The length of the extension is \( \frac{8}{11} \) meters.

To add these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 19 and 11 is 209.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 209:

\[
\frac{18}{19} = \frac{18 \times 11}{19 \times 11} = \frac{198}{209}

\[
\frac{8}{11} = \frac{8 \times 19}{11 \times 19} = \frac{152}{209}

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{198}{209} + \frac{152}{209} = \frac{198 + 152}{209} = \frac{350}{209}

Next, we subtract the amount used from the total amount Mandy initially had. Mandy initially had \( \frac{9}{2} \) kg of apples.

To perform the subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 2 and 4 is 4. We convert \( \frac{9}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9 \times 2}{2 \times 2} = \frac{18}{4} \]

Now, we subtract \( \frac{1}{4} \) from \( \frac{18}{4} \):

\[ \frac{18}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{18 - 1}{4} = \frac{17}{4} \]

So, Mandy has \( \frac{17}{4} \) kg of apples left. We can also convert this to a mixed number:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify the fractions involved. 

The fraction \( \frac{3}{9} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
\[ \frac{3}{9} = \frac{3 \div 3}{9 \div 3} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, we need to add the two fractions \( \frac{12}{7} \) and \( \frac{1}{3} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 3 is 21.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 21:
\[ \frac{12}{7} = \frac{12 \times 3}{7 \times 3} = \frac{36}{21} \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 7}{3 \times 7} = \frac{7}{21} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{36}{21} + \frac{7}{21} = \frac{36 + 7}{21} = \frac{43}{21} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total time John spent working on the watch, we need to add the time he spent fixing and polishing the watch to the time he spent adjusting its mechanism.

From the previous calculation, we know that John spent \( \frac{43}{21} \) hours fixing and polishing the watch. Now, we need to add \( \frac{12}{13} \) hours to this.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 21 and 13 is 273.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 273:
\[ \frac{43}{21} = \frac{43 \times 13}{21 \times 13} = \frac{559}{273} \]
\[ \frac{12}{13} = \frac{12 \times 21}{13 \times 21} = \frac{252}{273} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{559}{273} + \frac{252}{273} = \frac{559 + 252}{273} = \frac{811}{273} \]

So, John spent \( \frac{811}{273} \) hours in total working on the watch.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify the fraction \( \frac{3}{15} \). We can do this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
\[ \frac{3}{15} = \frac{3 \div 3}{15 \div 3} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Now, we need to add the two fractions \( \frac{12}{7} \) and \( \frac{1}{5} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 5 is 35.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 35:
\[ \frac{12}{7} = \frac{12 \times 5}{7 \times 5} = \frac{60}{35} \]
\[ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1 \times 7}{5 \times 7} = \frac{7}{35} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{60}{35} + \frac{7}{35} = \frac{60 + 7}{35} = \frac{67}{35} \]

1. Peggy initially swam 5/4 miles.
2. She swam back 1/12 miles.

Convert 5/4 to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[ \frac{5}{4} = \frac{5 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{15}{12} \]

Now, subtract the distance she swam back:
\[ \frac{15}{12} - \frac{1}{12} = \frac{15 - 1}{12} = \frac{14}{12} \]

The first part of the field is 4 acres.
The second part of the field is \( \frac{11}{12} \) of an acre.

We can add these two values directly:

\[ 4 + \frac{11}{12} \]

To add these, we can convert 4 into a fraction with a denominator of 12:

\[ 4 = \frac{48}{12} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[ \frac{48}{12} + \frac{11}{12} = \frac{48 + 11}{12} = \frac{59}{12} \]

So, the total number of acres the farmer uses to grow wheat is \( \frac{59}{12} \) acres.

To convert \( \frac{59}{12} \) into a mixed number:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total land area, we need to add the area of the additional patch of land to the total area used for growing wheat.

From the previous calculation, the total area used for growing wheat is \( \frac{59}{12} \) acres.

The additional patch of land for vegetables is \( \frac{17}{11} \) acres.

To add these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 12 and 11 is 132.

First, convert \( \frac{59}{12} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 132:

\[ \frac{59}{12} = \frac{59 \times 11}{12 \times 11} = \frac{649}{132} \]

Next, convert \( \frac{17}{11} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 132:

\[ \frac{17}{11} = \frac{17 \times 12}{11 \times 12} = \frac{204}{132} \]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[ \frac{649}{132} + \frac{204}{132} = \frac{649 + 204}{132} = \frac{853}{132} \]

To simplify \( \frac{853}{132} \), we can convert it to a mixed number:

\[ \frac{853}{132} = 6 \frac{61}{132} \]

Since 61 and 132 have no common factors other than 1, \( \frac{61}{132} \) is already in its simplest form.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 12 is 36.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 36:

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 68:

Now, we add the two fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much wire Jacob has remaining, we need to subtract the amount he used from the total amount he had.

First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The denominators are 2 and 16. The least common multiple of 2 and 16 is 16.

Convert \( \frac{11}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 16:
\[ \frac{11}{2} = \frac{11 \times 8}{2 \times 8} = \frac{88}{16} \]

Now, subtract \( \frac{5}{16} \) from \( \frac{88}{16} \):
\[ \frac{88}{16} - \frac{5}{16} = \frac{88 - 5}{16} = \frac{83}{16} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total duration of the rainfall, we need to add the two fractions representing the durations of the rainfalls.

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator. The fractions are \( \frac{4}{13} \) and \( \frac{11}{5} \).

The least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 5 is 65. We will convert both fractions to have this common denominator.

For \( \frac{4}{13} \):
\[ \frac{4}{13} = \frac{4 \times 5}{13 \times 5} = \frac{20}{65} \]

For \( \frac{11}{5} \):
\[ \frac{11}{5} = \frac{11 \times 13}{5 \times 13} = \frac{143}{65} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{20}{65} + \frac{143}{65} = \frac{20 + 143}{65} = \frac{163}{65} \]

To simplify \( \frac{163}{65} \), we can convert it to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{163}{65} = 2 \frac{33}{65} \]

So, the total duration of the rainfall is \( 2 \frac{33}{65} \) hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of hours it rained over the course of the two days, we need to add the total rainfall from the first day to the rainfall from the second day.

From the previous calculation, we know that the total rainfall on the first day was \( 2 \frac{33}{65} \) hours. We can convert this mixed number to an improper fraction:
\[ 2 \frac{33}{65} = \frac{2 \times 65 + 33}{65} = \frac{130 + 33}{65} = \frac{163}{65} \]

The rainfall on the second day lasted \( \frac{11}{19} \) hours.

To add these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 65 and 19 is 1235. We will convert both fractions to have this common denominator.

For \( \frac{163}{65} \):
\[ \frac{163}{65} = \frac{163 \times 19}{65 \times 19} = \frac{3097}{1235} \]

For \( \frac{11}{19} \):
\[ \frac{11}{19} = \frac{11 \times 65}{19 \times 65} = \frac{715}{1235} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{3097}{1235} + \frac{715}{1235} = \frac{3097 + 715}{1235} = \frac{3812}{1235} \]

To simplify \( \frac{3812}{1235} \), we can convert it to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{3812}{1235} = 3 \frac{1107}{1235} \]

So, the total amount of hours it rained over the course of these two days is \( 3 \frac{1107}{1235} \) hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fractions and then add them together.

Jane cuts 10/12 yards of fabric initially. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[ \frac{10}{12} = \frac{10 \div 2}{12 \div 2} = \frac{5}{6} \]

Next, Jane cuts an additional 10/10 yard, which simplifies to 1 yard:
\[ \frac{10}{10} = 1 \]

Now, we add the two amounts of fabric she cut:
\[ \frac{5}{6} + 1 \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 6 and 1 is 6. We convert 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 6:
\[ 1 = \frac{6}{6} \]

Now we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{5}{6} + \frac{6}{6} = \frac{5 + 6}{6} = \frac{11}{6} \]

So, Jane has cut a total of \( \frac{11}{6} \) yards of fabric from the blanket.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's start by adding the fractions of fabric Jane has already cut and then include the additional cut.

From the previous calculation, we know Jane initially cut:
\[ \frac{5}{6} \text{ yards} \]
and
\[ 1 \text{ yard} \]

We already combined these to get:
\[ \frac{5}{6} + 1 = \frac{5}{6} + \frac{6}{6} = \frac{11}{6} \text{ yards} \]

Now, Jane cuts an additional \( \frac{4}{12} \) yard. We can simplify \( \frac{4}{12} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
\[ \frac{4}{12} = \frac{4 \div 4}{12 \div 4} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Next, we need to add \( \frac{11}{6} \) and \( \frac{1}{3} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 3 is 6. We convert \( \frac{1}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:
\[ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 2}{3 \times 2} = \frac{2}{6} \]

Now we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{11}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{11 + 2}{6} = \frac{13}{6} \]

So, Jane has cut a total of \( \frac{13}{6} \) yards of fabric from the blanket.

Jane cuts 11/12 yard of fabric initially. This fraction is already in its simplest form:
\[ \frac{11}{12} \]

Next, Jane cuts an additional 10/10 yard, which simplifies to 1 yard:
\[ \frac{10}{10} = 1 \]

Now, we add the two amounts of fabric she cut:
\[ \frac{11}{12} + 1 \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 12 and 1 is 12. We convert 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[ 1 = \frac{12}{12} \]

Now we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{11}{12} + \frac{12}{12} = \frac{11 + 12}{12} = \frac{23}{12} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of magic dust the fairy used, we need to add the two amounts together: \( \frac{11}{12} \) oz and \( \frac{9}{10} \) oz.

First, we need a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 10 is 60.

Convert \( \frac{11}{12} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60:
\[ \frac{11}{12} = \frac{11 \times 5}{12 \times 5} = \frac{55}{60} \]

Convert \( \frac{9}{10} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60:
\[ \frac{9}{10} = \frac{9 \times 6}{10 \times 6} = \frac{54}{60} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{55}{60} + \frac{54}{60} = \frac{55 + 54}{60} = \frac{109}{60} \]

The total amount of magic dust the fairy used is \( \frac{109}{60} \) oz.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the total amount of magic dust the fairy used over the enchanted field and the grove of enchanted apple trees. We already calculated this in the previous problem:

\[ \frac{11}{12} + \frac{9}{10} = \frac{109}{60} \]

Next, we need to subtract this amount from the original amount of magic dust the fairy had in the forest, which is \( \frac{14}{3} \) oz.

First, convert \( \frac{14}{3} \) to a fraction with a common denominator of 60:

\[ \frac{14}{3} = \frac{14 \times 20}{3 \times 20} = \frac{280}{60} \]

Now, subtract the amount of dust used from the original amount:

\[ \frac{280}{60} - \frac{109}{60} = \frac{280 - 109}{60} = \frac{171}{60} \]

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{171}{60} \):

\[ \frac{171}{60} = \frac{57}{20} \]

So, the amount of magic dust left for the fairy is \( \frac{57}{20} \) oz.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total score for using 1 vowel and 1 consonant, we need to add the points assigned for each.

First, we calculate the points for the vowel:
\[ \text{Points for 1 vowel} = \frac{3}{11} \]

Next, we calculate the points for the consonant:
\[ \text{Points for 1 consonant} = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \]

Now, we add the points for the vowel and the consonant:
\[ \text{Total score} = \frac{3}{11} + 0.8 \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 11 and 10 is 110. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{3}{11} = \frac{3 \times 10}{11 \times 10} = \frac{30}{110} \]
\[ 0.8 = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{8 \times 11}{10 \times 11} = \frac{88}{110} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{30}{110} + \frac{88}{110} = \frac{30 + 88}{110} = \frac{118}{110} \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{118}{110} = \frac{59}{55} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pages the letter is now, we need to subtract the fraction of pages removed from the original length of the letter.

First, let's convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions for easier calculation:

The original length of the letter is \( \frac{4}{1} \), which is already an improper fraction.

The pages removed are \( \frac{14}{9} \).

Now, we need to subtract \( \frac{14}{9} \) from \( \frac{4}{1} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1 and 9 is 9.

Convert \( \frac{4}{1} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
\[ \frac{4}{1} = \frac{4 \times 9}{1 \times 9} = \frac{36}{9} \]

Now, subtract \( \frac{14}{9} \) from \( \frac{36}{9} \):
\[ \frac{36}{9} - \frac{14}{9} = \frac{36 - 14}{9} = \frac{22}{9} \]

Anne painted \( \frac{16}{20} \) of the table.

We add these fractions together:
\[
\frac{16}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{16 + 5}{20} = \frac{21}{20}

Since \( \frac{21}{20} \) is an improper fraction, it means that more than the entire table has been painted. Converting \( \frac{21}{20} \) to a mixed number:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the relative brightness of each star compared to an average star.

For the star Alpha:
Alpha shines \( \frac{17}{3} \) times brighter than an average star.

For the star Bravo:
Bravo shines \( \frac{20}{16} \) times as bright as an average star. Simplifying \( \frac{20}{16} \):
\[ \frac{20}{16} = \frac{5}{4} \]

Now, we need to add the relative brightness of both stars:
\[ \frac{17}{3} + \frac{5}{4} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.

Convert \( \frac{17}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[ \frac{17}{3} = \frac{17 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{68}{12} \]

Convert \( \frac{5}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[ \frac{5}{4} = \frac{5 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{15}{12} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{68}{12} + \frac{15}{12} = \frac{68 + 15}{12} = \frac{83}{12} \]

            Taking into account the previous situation, if we adjust the brightness of star Alpha such that it only shines 8/3 times brighter than an average star instead of 17/3 times, how much brighter would Alpha and Bravo combined be in comparison to an average star?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the new relative brightness of star Alpha and the relative brightness of star Bravo.

For the adjusted star Alpha:
Alpha now shines \( \frac{8}{3} \) times brighter than an average star.

For the star Bravo:
Bravo shines \( \frac{5}{4} \) times as bright as an average star (as previously calculated).

Now, we need to add the relative brightness of both stars:
\[ \frac{8}{3} + \frac{5}{4} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.

Convert \( \frac{8}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[ \frac{8}{3} = \frac{8 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{32}{12} \]

Convert \( \frac{5}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[ \frac{5}{4} = \frac{5 \times 3}{4 \times 3} = \frac{15}{12} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{32}{12} + \frac{15}{12} = \frac{32 + 15}{12} = \frac{47}{12} \]

Thus, the combined relative brightness of both stars compared to an average star is:
\[ \frac{47}{12} \]

To add these fractions, we can convert them to decimals:
\[ \frac{17}{20} = 0.85 \]
\[ \frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \]

            If a bus drives 12/20 of a mile then goes an additional 12/12 of a mile, how many miles did the bus travel in total?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fractions to understand the distances traveled.

The bus drives \( \frac{12}{20} \) of a mile. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
\[ \frac{12 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{3}{5} \]

Next, the bus drives \( \frac{12}{12} \) of a mile. Since the numerator and the denominator are the same, this fraction simplifies to 1:
\[ \frac{12}{12} = 1 \]

Now, we add the two distances together:
\[ \frac{3}{5} + 1 \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 5 and 1 is 5. We can rewrite 1 as \( \frac{5}{5} \):
\[ \frac{3}{5} + \frac{5}{5} = \frac{3 + 5}{5} = \frac{8}{5} \]

The fraction \( \frac{8}{5} \) can also be expressed as a mixed number:
\[ \frac{8}{5} = 1 \frac{3}{5} \]

So, the total distance the bus traveled is \( \frac{8}{5} \) miles or 1 \( \frac{3}{5} \) miles.

First, let's simplify the distance swum in the first hour:
\[ \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ miles} \]

Next, we have the distance swum in the second hour:
\[ \frac{13}{5} \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add these two distances together:
\[ \frac{1}{3} + \frac{13}{5} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{5}{15} \]
\[ \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{39}{15} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{5}{15} + \frac{39}{15} = \frac{5 + 39}{15} = \frac{44}{15} \]

Next, we have the distance swum in the second hour:

For the first beat:
\[

For the second beat:

To find the total time it takes for the drummer to hit the two beats together, we add the time for each beat:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total cord of wood burned in a day, we need to add the fractions 12/17 and 8/19.

First, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 19 is 323 (since 17 and 19 are both prime numbers, their LCM is their product).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 323:

\[
\frac{12}{17} = \frac{12 \times 19}{17 \times 19} = \frac{228}{323}
\]

\[
\frac{8}{19} = \frac{8 \times 17}{19 \times 17} = \frac{136}{323}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{228}{323} + \frac{136}{323} = \frac{228 + 136}{323} = \frac{364}{323}

Since \(\frac{364}{323}\) is an improper fraction, we can convert it to a mixed number:

\[
\frac{364}{323} = 1 + \frac{41}{323}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total cord of wood burned in one full day, we need to add the wood burned in the morning, evening, and night.

From the previous calculation, we know the fireplace burns \(1 + \frac{41}{323}\) cords of wood during the day (morning and evening combined).

Now, we need to add the additional \(\frac{19}{20}\) cord of wood burned at night.

First, we convert \(1 + \frac{41}{323}\) to an improper fraction:

\[
1 + \frac{41}{323} = \frac{323}{323} + \frac{41}{323} = \frac{364}{323}
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to add \(\frac{364}{323}\) and \(\frac{19}{20}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 323 and 20 is 6460.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 6460:

\[
\frac{364}{323} = \frac{364 \times 20}{323 \times 20} = \frac{7280}{6460}
\]

\[
\frac{19}{20} = \frac{19 \times 323}{20 \times 323} = \frac{6137}{6460}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{7280}{6460} + \frac{6137}{6460} = \frac{7280 + 6137}{6460} = \frac{13417}{6460}
\]

Since \(\frac{13417}{6460}\) is an improper fraction, we can convert it to a mixed number:

\[
\frac{13417}{6460} = 2 + \frac{3497}{6460}
\]

Thus, the total cord of wood burned in one full day is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance of the butterfly's flight, we need to add the distances of the two segments.

First segment: \( \frac{18}{19} \) miles
Second segment: \( \frac{9}{17} \) miles

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 19 and 17 is 323 (since 19 and 17 are both prime numbers, their LCM is their product).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 323:

\[
\frac{18}{19} = \frac{18 \times 17}{19 \times 17} = \frac{306}{323}
\]

\[
\frac{9}{17} = \frac{9 \times 19}{17 \times 19} = \frac{171}{323}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{306}{323} + \frac{171}{323} = \frac{306 + 171}{323} = \frac{477}{323}
\]

The total distance of the butterfly's flight is \( \frac{477}{323} \) miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance the butterfly has flown, we need to add the additional segment of \( \frac{19}{20} \) mile to the previously calculated distance of \( \frac{477}{323} \) miles.

First, we need a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{477}{323} \) and \( \frac{19}{20} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 323 and 20 is 6460.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 6460:

\[
\frac{477}{323} = \frac{477 \times 20}{323 \times 20} = \frac{9540}{6460}
\]

\[
\frac{19}{20} = \frac{19 \times 323}{20 \times 323} = \frac{6137}{6460}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{9540}{6460} + \frac{6137}{6460} = \frac{9540 + 6137}{6460} = \frac{15677}{6460}

First, simplify \( \frac{18}{12} \):

\[
\frac{18}{12} = \frac{18 \div 6}{12 \div 6} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Now, we need to add \( \frac{3}{2} \) and \( \frac{9}{17} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 17 is 34.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 34:

\[

\[
\frac{9}{17} = \frac{9 \times 2}{17 \times 2} = \frac{18}{34}

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new speed of the helium balloon, we need to add the initial speed to the increase in speed caused by the gust of wind.

The initial speed of the balloon is \( \frac{13}{6} \) feet per second.
The increase in speed due to the gust of wind is \( \frac{3}{16} \) feet per second.

To add these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 16 is 48.

First, convert \( \frac{13}{6} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 48:
\[ \frac{13}{6} = \frac{13 \times 8}{6 \times 8} = \frac{104}{48} \]

Next, convert \( \frac{3}{16} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 48:
\[ \frac{3}{16} = \frac{3 \times 3}{16 \times 3} = \frac{9}{48} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{104}{48} + \frac{9}{48} = \frac{104 + 9}{48} = \frac{113}{48} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">If a second identical helium balloon rises alongside the first one, and both balloons have the same speed, we need to find the combined speed of the two balloons.

From the previous calculation, the speed of one balloon is \( \frac{113}{48} \) feet per second.

To find the combined speed of the two balloons, we simply add the speed of the first balloon to the speed of the second balloon:
\[ \frac{113}{48} + \frac{113}{48} = \frac{113 + 113}{48} = \frac{226}{48} \]

We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 226 and 48. The GCD of 226 and 48 is 2.

So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[ \frac{226 \div 2}{48 \div 2} = \frac{113}{24} \]

Thus, the total combined speed of the two balloons is \( \frac{113}{24} \) feet per second.

Scarlett has \( \frac{16}{10} \) gallons of red paint. We can simplify this fraction:

She uses \( \frac{1}{20} \) of a gallon for a small art project.

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 20 is 20.

Now, we subtract \( \frac{2}{5} \) from \( \frac{60}{5} \):
\[ \frac{60}{5} - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{60 - 2}{5} = \frac{58}{5} \]

Finally, we convert \( \frac{58}{5} \) back to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{58}{5} = 11 \frac{3}{5} \]

So, Susie has \( 11 \frac{3}{5} \) chocolate bars left in the box.

            Susie has a box of 12 chocolate bars. She decides to eat 2/5 of a chocolate bar herself. Then, her friend Lucy takes a further 19/11 chocolate bars. How many chocolate bars are left in the box after Lucy takes some?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Susie and Lucy eat in total.

Susie eats \( \frac{2}{5} \) of a chocolate bar.

Lucy takes \( \frac{19}{11} \) chocolate bars.

Next, we need to add these two amounts together:
\[ \frac{2}{5} + \frac{19}{11} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 11 is 55.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 55:
\[ \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 11}{5 \times 11} = \frac{22}{55} \]
\[ \frac{19}{11} = \frac{19 \times 5}{11 \times 5} = \frac{95}{55} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{22}{55} + \frac{95}{55} = \frac{22 + 95}{55} = \frac{117}{55} \]

Next, we convert \( \frac{117}{55} \) to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{117}{55} = 2 \frac{7}{55} \]

So, Susie and Lucy together eat \( 2 \frac{7}{55} \) chocolate bars.

Now, we subtract this amount from the total number of chocolate bars in the box, which is 12:
\[ 12 - 2 \frac{7}{55} \]

Convert 12 to a fraction with a denominator of 55:
\[ 12 = \frac{660}{55} \]

Subtract \( 2 \frac{7}{55} \) from \( \frac{660}{55} \):
\[ \frac{660}{55} - \frac{117}{55} = \frac{660 - 117}{55} = \frac{543}{55} \]

Convert \( \frac{543}{55} \) back to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{543}{55} = 9 \frac{48}{55} \]

So, there are \( 9 \frac{48}{55} \) chocolate bars left in the box.

Next, we subtract the amount Susie eats from the total number of chocolate bars in the box. The total number of chocolate bars is 12.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 12 - \frac{2}{13} \]

To perform this subtraction, we can convert 12 into a fraction with a common denominator of 13:

1. The initial altitude of the plane is 2 miles.
2. The plane descends by \( \frac{10}{15} \) of a mile.

First, simplify \( \frac{10}{15} \):
\[ \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{2}{3} \]

Now, subtract \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile from 2 miles:
\[ 2 - \frac{2}{3} \]

To perform this subtraction, convert 2 into a fraction with a common denominator of 3:
\[ 2 = \frac{6}{3} \]

Now subtract:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance the child slid, we need to add the lengths of the two slides.

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator to make the addition easier. The denominators are 19 and 4. The least common multiple (LCM) of 19 and 4 is 76.

Convert \( \frac{6}{19} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 76:
\[ \frac{6}{19} = \frac{6 \times 4}{19 \times 4} = \frac{24}{76} \]

Convert \( \frac{17}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 76:
\[ \frac{17}{4} = \frac{17 \times 19}{4 \times 19} = \frac{323}{76} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{24}{76} + \frac{323}{76} = \frac{24 + 323}{76} = \frac{347}{76} \]

To simplify \( \frac{347}{76} \):

The rate of firewood burned in the early morning is:

Since the denominators are the same, we can directly add the numerators:

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 7 is 140. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            The alien originally travelled ((9 / 20) + (11 / 7)) light years towards earth. But what if instead, the alien had only travelled (9 / 20) + (11 / 11) light years to start with? How many light years would the alien have travelled then?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance the alien would have traveled with the new distances, we need to add \(\frac{9}{20}\) light years and \(\frac{11}{11}\) light years.

First, simplify \(\frac{11}{11}\):
\[ \frac{11}{11} = 1 \]

Now, we add the two distances:
\[ \frac{9}{20} + 1 \]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 20 and 1 is 20. We convert 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 20:
\[ 1 = \frac{20}{20} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{9}{20} + \frac{20}{20} = \frac{9 + 20}{20} = \frac{29}{20} \]

To simplify \(\frac{29}{20}\), we can convert it to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{29}{20} = 1 \frac{9}{20} \]

Thus, the alien would have traveled:
\[ 1 \frac{9}{20} \text{ light years} \]

            If Bob has 10/2 of a cucumber and he adds it to 1/7 of another cucumber, how many cucumbers does he have in total?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify the fraction \( \frac{10}{2} \):
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Next, we add this to \( \frac{1}{7} \):
\[ 5 + \frac{1}{7} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 and 7 is 7. We can rewrite 5 as a fraction with a denominator of 7:
\[ 5 = \frac{35}{7} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{35}{7} + \frac{1}{7} = \frac{35 + 1}{7} = \frac{36}{7} \]

So, Bob has \( \frac{36}{7} \) cucumbers in total.

            After combining the cucumbers, Bob duplicates his total amount. Now, how many cucumbers does he have?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we know that Bob initially has \(\frac{36}{7}\) cucumbers.

If he duplicates this amount, we multiply by 2:
\[ 2 \times \frac{36}{7} = \frac{2 \times 36}{7} = \frac{72}{7} \]

So, after duplicating his total amount, Bob has \(\frac{72}{7}\) cucumbers.
