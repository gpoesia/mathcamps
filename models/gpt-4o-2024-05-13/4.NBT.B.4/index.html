Morning shift production: 2489 cars

Now, we add these two quantities together:

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:

1. Add the units place: \( 9 + 1 = 10 \) (write down 0 and carry over 1)
2. Add the tens place: \( 8 + 9 = 17 \), plus the carry-over 1 makes it \( 18 \) (write down 8 and carry over 1)
3. Add the hundreds place: \( 4 + 6 = 10 \), plus the carry-over 1 makes it \( 11 \) (write down 1 and carry over 1)

            After manufacturing 2489 cars during the morning shift and 4691 cars in the afternoon shift, the auto plant had to continue production into the night due to high demand.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of cars produced during the entire day, we need to add the number of cars produced during the morning, afternoon, and night shifts.

Morning shift production: 2489 cars
Afternoon shift production: 4691 cars
Night shift production: 1859 cars

First, let's add the morning and afternoon shift productions:

\[ 2489 + 4691 \]

We already calculated this in the previous problem:

\[ 2489 + 4691 = 7180 \]

Now, we need to add the night shift production to this total:

\[ 7180 + 1859 \]

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:

1. Add the units place: \( 0 + 9 = 9 \)
2. Add the tens place: \( 8 + 5 = 13 \) (write down 3 and carry over 1)
3. Add the hundreds place: \( 1 + 8 = 9 \), plus the carry-over 1 makes it \( 10 \) (write down 0 and carry over 1)
4. Add the thousands place: \( 7 + 1 = 8 \), plus the carry-over 1 makes it \( 9 \)

So, the total number of cars produced is:

First, we know the factory produced 4012 tubes in the morning shift.

Next, the factory increased its production by 882 tubes in the afternoon shift. Therefore, the number of tubes produced in the afternoon shift is:
\[ 4012 + 882 \]

Now, let's perform the addition:

Let's perform the subtraction step-by-step:

1. Subtract the units place: \( 1 - 1 = 0 \)
2. Subtract the tens place: \( 4 - 9 \) (since 4 is less than 9, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place, making it 14 - 9 = 5)
3. Subtract the hundreds place: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) (after borrowing, the original 5 becomes 4, so 4 - 2 = 2)
4. Subtract the thousands place: \( 6 - 1 = 5 \)

Let's do the calculation step-by-step:

1. Subtract the units place:

2. Now, subtract:

3. Move to the tens place:

First, we already calculated the remaining inventory after the sale:

Next, we need to subtract the number of pairs donated:
\[ 5303 - 3328 \]

Let's do the calculation step-by-step:

1. Subtract the units place:

   Since 3 is less than 8, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place. This makes the units place 13 and the tens place 9 (since we borrowed 1 from 0, which itself borrowed 1 from the hundreds place).

2. Now, subtract:
   \[ 13 - 8 = 5 \]

3. Move to the tens place:
   \[ 9 - 2 = 7 \]

4. Move to the hundreds place:
   \[ 2 - 3 \]
   Since 2 is less than 3, we need to borrow 1 from the thousands place. This makes the hundreds place 12 and the thousands place 4.

5. Now, subtract:

6. Finally, the thousands place:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the difference in the number of starfish between the two parts of the ocean, we need to subtract the smaller number from the larger number.

First, identify the two numbers:
- Number of starfish in the first part: 5035
- Number of starfish in the second part: 4371

Next, perform the subtraction:
\[ 5035 - 4371 \]

Let's do the calculation step-by-step:
1. Subtract the units place: \( 5 - 1 = 4 \)
2. Subtract the tens place: \( 3 - 7 \) (since 3 is smaller than 7, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place)
   - Borrow 1 from the hundreds place: \( 13 - 7 = 6 \)
3. Subtract the hundreds place: \( 0 - 3 \) (since 0 is smaller than 3, we need to borrow 1 from the thousands place)
   - Borrow 1 from the thousands place: \( 10 - 3 = 7 \)
4. Subtract the thousands place: \( 4 - 4 = 0 \)

Putting it all together, we get:
\[ 5035 - 4371 = 664 \]

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of endangered frog species, we need to subtract the number of non-endangered species from the total number of frog species.

Total number of frog species = 6336
Number of non-endangered species = 2712

Number of endangered species = Total number of frog species - Number of non-endangered species
= 6336 - 2712

Let's perform the subtraction:

6336
-2712
_____
3624

So, the number of endangered frog species is 3624.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of colored pencils the artist has, we need to add the number of blue colored pencils he originally had to the number of colored pencils he bought later.

Original number of blue colored pencils: 4667
Number of colored pencils bought later: 4042

Now, we add these two quantities together:

\[ 4667 + 4042 \]

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:

1. Add the units place: \( 7 + 2 = 9 \)
2. Add the tens place: \( 6 + 4 = 10 \) (write down 0 and carry over 1)
3. Add the hundreds place: \( 6 + 0 + 1 = 7 \)

Total number of colored pencils before the donation: 8709
Number of colored pencils given away: 7808

Now, we perform the subtraction:

\[ 8709 - 7808 \]

Let's perform the subtraction step-by-step:

1. Subtract the units place: \( 9 - 8 = 1 \)
2. Subtract the tens place: \( 0 - 0 = 0 \)
3. Subtract the hundreds place: \( 7 - 8 \) (since 7 is less than 8, we need to borrow 1 from the thousands place)
4. After borrowing, the thousands place becomes 7 and the hundreds place becomes 17. Now, subtract the hundreds place: \( 17 - 8 = 9 \)
5. Subtract the thousands place: \( 7 - 7 = 0 \)

So, the number of colored pencils left is:

\[ 8709 - 7808 = 901 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the total number of births in 2020. We already calculated this in the previous problem:

Total births in 2020 = 2854 (boy births) + 5764 (girl births) = 8618

Next, we need to account for the decrease in the number of births in 2021. The problem states that there were 4888 fewer babies born in 2021 compared to 2020.

To find the number of births in 2021, we subtract the decrease from the total number of births in 2020:

Number of births in 2021 = Total births in 2020 - Decrease in births
Number of births in 2021 = 8618 - 4888

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Subtract the units place: \( 8 - 2 = 6 \)

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many fewer soaps were produced due to the technical issue, we need to subtract the reduced production from the peak production.

Peak production: 3659 soaps per day
Reduced production: 1423 soaps per day

The difference in production is calculated as follows:
\[ 3659 - 1423 = 2236 \]

So, the factory produced 2236 fewer soaps per day due to the technical issue.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the reduced speed of the wind gust, we need to subtract the decrease in speed from the original speed.

Original speed of the wind gust: 4245 km/h
Decrease in speed: 1152 km/h

Reduced speed = Original speed - Decrease in speed
Reduced speed = 4245 km/h - 1152 km/h

Now, perform the subtraction:
4245 - 1152 = 3093

            Initially, a strong wind gust was measured at 6475 km/h instead of 4245 km/h. After a while, the speed went down by 1152 km/h. What speed did the wind gust reduce to in this situation?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the reduced speed of the wind gust, we need to subtract the decrease in speed from the initial speed.

Initial speed of the wind gust: 6475 km/h
Decrease in speed: 1152 km/h

Reduced speed = Initial speed - Decrease in speed
Reduced speed = 6475 km/h - 1152 km/h

Now, perform the subtraction:
6475 - 1152 = 5323
