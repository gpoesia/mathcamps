Calculating the sum step-by-step:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of a regular hexagon, we need to remember that a regular hexagon has six equal sides. 

Given the perimeter of the hexagon is 522 meters, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 6 \times \text{side length} \]

Let \( s \) be the length of each side. Then:

\[ 6s = 522 \]

To find \( s \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ s = \frac{522}{6} \]

\[ s = 87 \]

Given:
- Perimeter of the polygon = 418 meters
- Number of sides = 11

We use the formula for the length of each side:

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Length of each side} = \frac{418 \, \text{m}}{11} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the unknown ninth side of the nonagon, we first need to sum the lengths of the eight known sides and then subtract this sum from the total perimeter.

First, let's add the lengths of the eight known sides:
\[ 30 \, \text{cm} + 18 \, \text{cm} + 68 \, \text{cm} + 23 \, \text{cm} + 72 \, \text{cm} + 57 \, \text{cm} + 33 \, \text{cm} + 19 \, \text{cm} \]

Calculating step-by-step:
\[ 30 + 18 = 48 \]
\[ 48 + 68 = 116 \]
\[ 116 + 23 = 139 \]
\[ 139 + 72 = 211 \]
\[ 211 + 57 = 268 \]
\[ 268 + 33 = 301 \]
\[ 301 + 19 = 320 \]

The sum of the eight known side lengths is 320 cm.

Next, we subtract this sum from the total perimeter to find the length of the unknown ninth side:
\[ 350 \, \text{cm} - 320 \, \text{cm} = 30 \, \text{cm} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the ninth side of the nonagon, we first need to sum the lengths of the known eight sides and then subtract this sum from the total perimeter.

The known side lengths are: 19m, 7m, 10m, 16m, 32m, 15m, 70m, and 19m.

First, we sum these lengths:
\[ 19 + 7 + 10 + 16 + 32 + 15 + 70 + 19 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 19 + 7 = 26 \]
\[ 26 + 10 = 36 \]
\[ 36 + 16 = 52 \]
\[ 52 + 32 = 84 \]
\[ 84 + 15 = 99 \]
\[ 99 + 70 = 169 \]
\[ 169 + 19 = 188 \]

So, the sum of the known side lengths is 188 meters.

Given that the total perimeter of the nonagon is 188 meters, we subtract the sum of the known side lengths from the total perimeter to find the length of the ninth side:
\[ 188 - 188 = 0 \]

Therefore, the length of the ninth side is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of a regular hexagon, we need to remember that a regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.

Given the total perimeter of the hexagon is 42 meters, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 6 \times \text{side length} \]

Let \( s \) be the length of each side. Then:
\[ 6s = 42 \]

To find \( s \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ s = \frac{42}{6} \]
\[ s = 7 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the tenth side of the polygon, we first need to determine the sum of the lengths of the given nine sides. 

The lengths of the nine sides are:
17m, 13m, 61m, 16m, 11m, 83m, 28m, 48m, and 93m.

Let's add these lengths together:
\[ 17 + 13 + 61 + 16 + 11 + 83 + 28 + 48 + 93 \]

First, we can group and add them step by step:
\[ 17 + 13 = 30 \]
\[ 30 + 61 = 91 \]
\[ 91 + 16 = 107 \]
\[ 107 + 11 = 118 \]
\[ 118 + 83 = 201 \]
\[ 201 + 28 = 229 \]
\[ 229 + 48 = 277 \]
\[ 277 + 93 = 370 \]

The sum of the lengths of the nine sides is 370 meters.

The total perimeter of the polygon is given as 468 meters. To find the length of the tenth side, we subtract the sum of the nine sides from the total perimeter:
\[ 468 - 370 = 98 \]

\[ 146 + 97 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 63 = 306 \]
\[ 306 + 88 = 394 \]

The sum of the given eight sides is 394 meters.

The total perimeter of the nonagon is 402 meters. To find the length of the ninth side, we subtract the sum of the eight sides from the total perimeter:
\[ 402 - 394 = 8 \]

The lengths of the known sides are:

- 94 meters
- 59 meters

First, we add these lengths together:

Let \( s \) be the length of one side. For a heptagon, the number of sides is 7. Therefore:

\[ 310 + 45 = 355 \]
\[ 355 + 74 = 429 \]
\[ 429 + 85 = 514 \]
\[ 514 + 85 = 599 \]
\[ 599 + 43 = 642 \]

The sum of the nine given sides is 642 meters.

The total perimeter of the decagon is 682 meters. To find the length of the tenth side, we subtract the sum of the nine sides from the total perimeter:
\[ 682 - 642 = 40 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of a regular septagon, we need to divide the total perimeter by the number of sides.

The perimeter of the septagon is 161 meters, and it has 7 sides.

Length of each side = Total perimeter / Number of sides
\[ \text{Length of each side} = \frac{161 \text{ meters}}{7} \]

Now, we perform the division:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of a regular hexagon, we need to remember that a regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.

Given the perimeter of the hexagon is 324 meters, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 6 \times \text{side length} \]

Let \( s \) be the length of each side. Then:
\[ 6s = 324 \]

To find \( s \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ s = \frac{324}{6} \]

Calculating the division:
\[ s = 54 \]

So, the length of each side of the hexagon is 54 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of each side of a regular decagon, we need to know that a regular decagon has 10 equal sides.

Given the perimeter of the decagon is 930 cm, we can find the length of each side by dividing the perimeter by the number of sides.

\[
\text{Length of each side} = \frac{\text{Perimeter}}{\text{Number of sides}} = \frac{930 \, \text{cm}}{10}
\]

\[
\text{Length of each side} = 93 \, \text{cm}
\]

            A decagon has eight of its sides measuring 24m, 25m, 75m, 38m, 18m, 42m and 61m. If the total perimeter of the decagon is 359m, can you find the length of one of the unknown sides?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of one of the unknown sides of the decagon, we first need to sum the lengths of the known sides. The known sides are 24m, 25m, 75m, 38m, 18m, 42m, and 61m.

Let's add these lengths together:
\[ 24 + 25 + 75 + 38 + 18 + 42 + 61 \]

First, add 24 and 25:
\[ 24 + 25 = 49 \]

Next, add 49 and 75:
\[ 49 + 75 = 124 \]

Next, add 124 and 38:
\[ 124 + 38 = 162 \]

Next, add 162 and 18:
\[ 162 + 18 = 180 \]

Next, add 180 and 42:
\[ 180 + 42 = 222 \]

Finally, add 222 and 61:
\[ 222 + 61 = 283 \]

The sum of the known sides is 283 meters. The total perimeter of the decagon is 359 meters. To find the total length of the unknown sides, we subtract the sum of the known sides from the total perimeter:
\[ 359 - 283 = 76 \]

Since there are two unknown sides and their total length is 76 meters, we can divide this by 2 to find the length of one unknown side:
\[ 76 \div 2 = 38 \]

Given side lengths: 52m, 52m, 44m, 53m, 41m, 91m, 25m, and 2m.

First, we sum these lengths:
\[ 52 + 52 + 44 + 53 + 41 + 91 + 25 + 2 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 52 + 52 = 104 \]
\[ 104 + 44 = 148 \]
\[ 148 + 53 = 201 \]
\[ 201 + 41 = 242 \]

The sum of the given side lengths is 360 meters.

The total perimeter of the nonagon is 368 meters. To find the length of the final side, we subtract the sum of the given side lengths from the total perimeter:

Let's add these lengths together:

First, we can add them step by step:

\[ 44 + 5 = 49 \]
\[ 49 + 96 = 145 \]
\[ 145 + 78 = 223 \]
\[ 223 + 49 = 272 \]
