            In a school competition, Aliyah correctly guesses 11 letter games and then correctly guesses 7 more games. But when she guesses the next game, she loses 6 times. What is the total number of letter games Aliyah correctly guessed in the end?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total number of letter games Aliyah correctly guessed, we need to add the number of games she guessed correctly initially and subsequently, and then account for the losses.

1. Aliyah correctly guesses 11 letter games initially.
2. She then correctly guesses 7 more games.

Adding these together:
\[ 11 + 7 = 18 \]

3. She then loses 6 times, but since the problem asks for the total number of games she correctly guessed, the losses do not affect the count of correct guesses.

Thus, the total number of letter games Aliyah correctly guessed is:
\[ 18 \]

Current number of ducks = Total number of ducks - Number of ducks that wandered off
Current number of ducks = 12 - 2

Initially, Mia had 7 pairs of roller skates.

\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \] pairs of roller skates.

Now, she has a total of 13 pairs of roller skates. To find out how many pairs she bought, we subtract the number of pairs she had after giving away the 3 pairs from the total number of pairs she has now:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of rooms above the ground floor or in the basement, we need to consider the total number of rooms in the house, subtract the number of rooms on the ground floor, and then add the basement room.

Given:
- Total number of rooms in the house = 18
- Number of rooms on the ground floor = 5
- Basement room = 1

First, we calculate the number of rooms above the ground floor:
\[ \text{Number of rooms above the ground floor} = \text{Total number of rooms} - \text{Number of rooms on the ground floor} \]
\[ \text{Number of rooms above the ground floor} = 18 - 5 \]
\[ \text{Number of rooms above the ground floor} = 13 \]

Next, we add the basement room to this number:
\[ \text{Number of rooms above the ground floor or in the basement} = \text{Number of rooms above the ground floor} + \text{Basement room} \]
\[ \text{Number of rooms above the ground floor or in the basement} = 13 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Number of rooms above the ground floor or in the basement} = 14 \]

However, the shop usually closes one hour before the time it is supposed to. Therefore, we need to subtract 1 hour from 18:00.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of teeth the baby Tyrannosaurus Rex has after one week, we start with the initial number of teeth and add the number of teeth it grows in one week.

1. Initial number of teeth: 1
2. Teeth grown in one week: 3

Now, we add these two quantities together:
\[ 1 \text{ (initial tooth)} + 3 \text{ (teeth grown in one week)} = 4 \text{ teeth} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many beach balls David has left after giving 3 to his friends, we need to subtract the number of beach balls he gave away from the total number he had.

David originally had 19 beach balls (from the previous calculation).

Now, we subtract these two quantities:
