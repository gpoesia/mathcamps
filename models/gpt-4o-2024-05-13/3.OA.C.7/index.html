For each word:
- The alien transmits 11 times per minute.

Since the alien knows two words:
- The total number of transmissions in 1 minute is \( 11 \times 2 \).

Calculating this:
\[ 11 \times 2 = 22 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many miles the plane would cover in 6 minutes, we can use the given constant speed and multiply it by the time traveled.

The plane's speed is 12 miles per minute. Therefore, in 6 minutes, the distance covered would be:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 12 \, \text{miles/minute} \times 6 \, \text{minutes} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many gold doubloons each crew member will get, we need to divide the total number of gold doubloons by the number of crew members.

The total number of gold doubloons is 36, and there are 7 crew members.

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{36}{7} \approx 5.14 \]

Since we are dealing with gold doubloons, which are typically whole units, each crew member will get 5 gold doubloons, and there will be a remainder.

To find the remainder:
\[ 36 \div 7 = 5 \text{ remainder } 1 \]

So, each crew member will get 5 gold doubloons, and there will be 1 gold doubloon left over.

### Answer: 5 gold doubloons each, with 1 gold doubloon left over.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many shoes the factory can produce in five hours, we first need to find the rate at which the factory produces shoes per hour.

The factory produces 24 shoes in 3 hours. Therefore, the production rate per hour is:
\[ \text{Production rate} = \frac{24 \text{ shoes}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 8 \text{ shoes per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of shoes produced in five hours by multiplying the production rate by the number of hours:
\[ \text{Total shoes} = 8 \text{ shoes per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ shoes} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many toy cars the factory produces in one day, we need to consider the production rate and the number of hours the factory operates each day.

The factory produces 8 cars every hour. If it runs for 12 hours a day, we can calculate the total number of cars produced in one day by multiplying the production rate by the number of hours:

\[ \text{Number of cars produced in one day} = \text{Production rate per hour} \times \text{Number of hours per day} \]

\[ \text{Number of cars produced in one day} = 8 \, \text{cars/hour} \times 12 \, \text{hours/day} \]

We know that:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ inches}} = \frac{x \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ inch}} \]

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply and solve the equation:

\[ 30 = 10x \]

            Following the previous situation with Emma and her friends building sandcastles, imagine that they had originally started with 5 sandcastles instead of 6. Each of these 5 sandcastles still uses 4 buckets of sand and each of these buckets contains 3 shovels of sand. How many shovels of sand would they have used then?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the total number of buckets of sand used for the sandcastles. Each sandcastle uses 4 buckets of sand, and they build 5 sandcastles:

\[ 4 \text{ buckets/sandcastle} \times 5 \text{ sandcastles} = 20 \text{ buckets} \]

Next, we need to find out how many shovels of sand are in each bucket. Each bucket contains 3 shovels full of sand:

\[ 3 \text{ shovels/bucket} \]

Now, we multiply the total number of buckets by the number of shovels per bucket to find the total number of shovels of sand used:

\[ 20 \text{ buckets} \times 3 \text{ shovels/bucket} = 60 \text{ shovels} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pairs of pants John should pack, we need to use the given relationship between the pairs of pants and pairs of socks. Specifically, for each pair of pants, John needs 2 pairs of socks.

Given:
- John plans to bring 22 pairs of socks.
- Each pair of pants requires 2 pairs of socks.

We can set up the following equation to find the number of pairs of pants (let's call this number \( p \)):

\[ 2p = 22 \]

To solve for \( p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ p = \frac{22}{2} \]
\[ p = 11 \]

Thus, John should pack 11 pairs of pants.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of pants} = \text{Number of pairs of socks} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many honey pots each cub will receive if the mother bear distributes them among 10 cubs, we need to divide the total number of honey pots by the number of cubs.

Given:
- Total honey pots = 40

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{40}{10} = 4 \]

So, each cub will receive 4 honey pots.

            A penguin is diving into the sea. Initially, it took the penguin 28 seconds to reach a depth that is 4 times its own height. What is the square of the depth the penguin reaches in seconds?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to determine the depth the penguin reaches and then find the square of that depth.

First, let's denote the penguin's height as \( h \). According to the problem, the depth the penguin reaches is 4 times its height, which can be expressed as \( 4h \).

Next, we are given that it took the penguin 28 seconds to reach this depth. However, the problem asks for the square of the depth in seconds, not the time taken.

The depth the penguin reaches is \( 4h \). To find the square of this depth, we calculate:
\[
(4h)^2 = 16h^2
\]

Since the problem does not provide the actual height \( h \) of the penguin, we can only express the square of the depth in terms of \( h \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total number of back and forth swings the swing will accomplish in 9 minutes, we start by noting that the swing goes back and forth 10 times every minute.

First, we calculate the number of swings per minute:

Next, we multiply the number of swings per minute by the total number of minutes:
