            Steve started with 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days. Then he received an extra 11 dollars. John started with 18 dollars but then he spent the same amount of money as Steve had. John found 25 dollars on the street. How much money does John have now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how much money Steve spent each day. Steve started with 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days. 

Amount spent per day by Steve:
\[ \frac{38 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ days}} = 4.75 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Total amount spent by Steve over 8 days:
\[ 4.75 \text{ dollars/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 38 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending all his money, Steve received an extra 11 dollars. So, Steve's final amount is:
\[ 0 \text{ dollars} + 11 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's consider John's situation. John started with 18 dollars and spent the same amount as Steve, which is 38 dollars.

John's remaining money after spending:
\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 38 \text{ dollars} = -20 \text{ dollars} \]

John then found 25 dollars on the street. So, his final amount is:
\[ -20 \text{ dollars} + 25 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

To simplify \( \frac{27}{30} \):
\[ \frac{27}{30} = \frac{9 \times 3}{10 \times 3} = \frac{9}{10} \]

So, the coin is worth \( \frac{9}{10} \) dollars, which is equivalent to $0.90.

Now, let's add \( \frac{5}{36} \) dollars to $45.90. To do this, we can convert \( \frac{5}{36} \) to a decimal:
\[ \frac{5}{36} \approx 0.1389 \]

            Sally wants to measure the distance of her bike route. Initially, she hesitates and travels only 47/50 of a mile. Then, she gains confidence and rides another 31 miles. Every day for the next 28 days, she completes the same distance.

One day, she decided to detour and added an extra 32/24 miles to her regular bike route. How many miles in total did she travel after adding the extra traveling distance?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total distance Sally traveled, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and then sum them up.

1. **Initial Distance:**
   Sally initially travels \( \frac{47}{50} \) of a mile.
   \[
   \frac{47}{50} = 0.94 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance for the Next 28 Days:**
   Each day, Sally rides 31 miles. Over 28 days, the total distance is:
   \[
   31 \text{ miles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 868 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total Distance Before the Detour:**
   Adding the initial distance to the distance over 28 days:
   \[
   0.94 \text{ miles} + 868 \text{ miles} = 868.94 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Extra Distance on the Detour Day:**
   On one day, Sally adds an extra \( \frac{32}{24} \) miles to her regular route. Simplifying \( \frac{32}{24} \):
   \[
   \frac{32}{24} = \frac{4 \times 8}{4 \times 6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Total Distance Including the Detour:**
   Adding the extra distance to the total distance before the detour:
   \[
   868.94 \text{ miles} + 1.33 \text{ miles} = 870.27 \text{ miles}

Then, if an additional 49 kilometers are added to the journey, what would be the total distance then?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the initial distance the truck can travel on a liter of fuel, which is given as \( \frac{34}{25} \) kilometers.

Next, we add 11 kilometers to this initial distance:
\[
\frac{34}{25} + 11
\]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 25 and 1 (since 11 can be written as \( \frac{11}{1} \)) is 25. We convert 11 to a fraction with a denominator of 25:
\[
11 = \frac{11 \times 25}{1 \times 25} = \frac{275}{25}
\]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{34}{25} + \frac{275}{25} = \frac{34 + 275}{25} = \frac{309}{25}
\]

So, the total distance after adding 11 kilometers is:
\[
\frac{309}{25} \text{ kilometers}

Next, we add an additional 49 kilometers to this new total distance:
\[
\frac{309}{25} + 49

Again, we convert 49 to a fraction with a denominator of 25:
\[
49 = \frac{49 \times 25}{1 \times 25} = \frac{1225}{25}

Now, we add these fractions:
\[
\frac{309}{25} + \frac{1225}{25} = \frac{309 + 1225}{25} = \frac{1534}{25}

So, the total distance after adding 49 kilometers is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the initial distance the truck can travel on a liter of fuel, which is given as \( \frac{34}{25} \) kilometers.

Next, we add 30 kilometers to this initial distance:
\[
\frac{34}{25} + 30
\]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 25 and 1 (since 30 can be written as \( \frac{30}{1} \)) is 25. We convert 30 to a fraction with a denominator of 25:
\[
30 = \frac{30 \times 25}{1 \times 25} = \frac{750}{25}

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{34}{25} + \frac{750}{25} = \frac{34 + 750}{25} = \frac{784}{25}

So, the total distance after adding 30 kilometers is:

            John drank a special energy drink that increased his jogging speed. After the energy drink, he was able to jog 50/49 miles per hour faster. One day, he had a speed of 4/22 miles per hour without the use of the energy drink. After consuming the energy drink, at what rate would he jog if he continued for 46/30 hours?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the given fractions to make the calculations easier.

1. Simplify John's speed without the energy drink:
\[ \frac{4}{22} = \frac{2}{11} \text{ miles per hour} \]

2. Simplify the increase in speed due to the energy drink:
\[ \frac{50}{49} \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, add the increase in speed to John's original speed:
\[ \frac{2}{11} + \frac{50}{49} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 11 and 49 is 539.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 539:
\[ \frac{2}{11} = \frac{2 \times 49}{11 \times 49} = \frac{98}{539} \]
\[ \frac{50}{49} = \frac{50 \times 11}{49 \times 11} = \frac{550}{539} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{98}{539} + \frac{550}{539} = \frac{98 + 550}{539} = \frac{648}{539} \]

So, John's speed after consuming the energy drink is:
\[ \frac{648}{539} \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the distance he would jog if he continued at this rate for \( \frac{46}{30} \) hours. Simplify the time fraction:
\[ \frac{46}{30} = \frac{23}{15} \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{648}{539} \times \frac{23}{15} \]

Multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{648 \times 23}{539 \times 15} = \frac{14904}{8085} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{14904}{8085} = \frac{14904 \div 3}{8085 \div 3} = \frac{4968}{2695} \]

Thus, the distance John would jog is:
\[ \frac{4968}{2695} \text{ miles} \]

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Given the same scenario, what if John chose to jog for a slightly longer time of 46/35 hours instead? How much more distance would he cover after consuming the energy drink and jogging at the increased speed?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall John's speed after consuming the energy drink, which we previously calculated as:
\[ \frac{648}{539} \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to determine the distance he would jog if he continued at this rate for \( \frac{46}{35} \) hours. Simplify the time fraction:
\[ \frac{46}{35} \text{ hours} \]

Calculate the distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{648}{539} \times \frac{46}{35} \]

Multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{648 \times 46}{539 \times 35} = \frac{29808}{18865} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{29808}{18865} \]

Next, we need to compare this distance with the distance he would jog in \( \frac{46}{30} \) hours, which we previously calculated as:
\[ \frac{4968}{2695} \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much more distance he would cover, we subtract the two distances:
\[ \frac{29808}{18865} - \frac{4968}{2695} \]

First, convert both fractions to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18865 and 2695 is 18865 (since 2695 is a factor of 18865).

Convert the second fraction:
\[ \frac{4968}{2695} = \frac{4968 \times 7}{2695 \times 7} = \frac{34776}{18865} \]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[ \frac{29808}{18865} - \frac{34776}{18865} = \frac{29808 - 34776}{18865} = \frac{-4968}{18865} \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that the distance covered in \( \frac{46}{35} \) hours is actually less than the distance covered in \( \frac{46}{30} \) hours. This suggests an error in the initial setup or interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the time fractions to ensure correctness.

Given the initial problem setup, the correct approach should be to re-calculate the distances accurately and compare them. However, based on the initial calculations, the distance covered in \( \frac{46}{35} \) hours should be less than in \( \frac{46}{30} \) hours due to the time fraction being smaller.

### Answer: The distance covered in \( \frac{46}{35} \) hours is less than in \( \frac{46}{30} \) hours, indicating a need to re-evaluate the problem setup.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify the fractions 21/36 and 26/42.

For 21/36:
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 21 and 36 is 3.
- Simplifying 21/36 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
  \[
  \frac{21}{36} = \frac{21 \div 3}{36 \div 3} = \frac{7}{12}
  \]

For 26/42:
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 26 and 42 is 2.
- Simplifying 26/42 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
  \[
  \frac{26}{42} = \frac{26 \div 2}{42 \div 2} = \frac{13}{21}
  \]

Next, we need to add these simplified fractions to the initial 9 gallons of gas. To do this, we first need a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{7}{12}\) and \(\frac{13}{21}\).

The least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 21 is 84.

Converting \(\frac{7}{12}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 84:
\[
\frac{7}{12} = \frac{7 \times 7}{12 \times 7} = \frac{49}{84}
\]

Converting \(\frac{13}{21}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 84:
\[
\frac{13}{21} = \frac{13 \times 4}{21 \times 4} = \frac{52}{84}
\]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{49}{84} + \frac{52}{84} = \frac{49 + 52}{84} = \frac{101}{84}
\]

Next, we convert \(\frac{101}{84}\) to a decimal to add it to the 9 gallons:
\[
\frac{101}{84} \approx 1.2024
\]

Finally, adding this to the initial 9 gallons:
\[
9 + 1.2024 = 10.2024
\]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how far the supermarket is from John's work, we need to subtract the distance that the supermarket is closer to his work from the distance of John's house to his work.

First, let's find the distance of John's house to his work:
\[ \text{Distance from John's house to work} = \frac{17}{3} \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that the supermarket is \(\frac{25}{41}\) miles closer to his work than his house. Therefore, we subtract this distance from the distance of John's house to his work:
\[ \text{Distance from the supermarket to work} = \frac{17}{3} - \frac{25}{41} \]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 41 is 123. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{17}{3} = \frac{17 \times 41}{3 \times 41} = \frac{697}{123} \]
\[ \frac{25}{41} = \frac{25 \times 3}{41 \times 3} = \frac{75}{123} \]

Now, we subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{697}{123} - \frac{75}{123} = \frac{697 - 75}{123} = \frac{622}{123} \]

Thus, the distance from the supermarket to John's work is:

First, let's recall the distance of John's house to his work:
\[ \text{Distance from John's house to work} = \frac{17}{3} \text{ miles} \]

Now, the supermarket is \(\frac{25}{46}\) miles closer to his work than his house. Therefore, we subtract this distance from the distance of John's house to his work:
\[ \text{Distance from the supermarket to work} = \frac{17}{3} - \frac{25}{46} \]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 46 is 138. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{17}{3} = \frac{17 \times 46}{3 \times 46} = \frac{782}{138} \]
\[ \frac{25}{46} = \frac{25 \times 3}{46 \times 3} = \frac{75}{138} \]

Now, we subtract the two fractions:

1. Start with the initial amount of money the bank has: $12.
2. Add the amount received from the deposit: $36.

First, we add the deposit to the initial amount:

1. Start with the amount of money the bank had after the previous transactions: $40.

How much money will John have in his investment account after a year?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how much money John needs to save to buy the video game. The game costs $40, and John already has $29.

\[ \text{Amount needed} = \$40 - \$29 = \$11 \]

John saves \(\frac{20}{48}\) of the money he needs every week. Let's simplify this fraction:

\[ \frac{20}{48} = \frac{5}{12} \]

So, John saves \(\frac{5}{12}\) of $11 each week:

\[ \text{Weekly savings} = \frac{5}{12} \times 11 = \frac{55}{12} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John has saved after a certain period of time. Let's assume he saves for \(n\) weeks. The total savings after \(n\) weeks would be:

\[ \text{Total savings} = n \times \frac{55}{12} \]

John decides to put all his savings into an investment account. The account promises a return of \(\frac{41}{11}\) times the money invested after a year. Therefore, the amount of money John will have in his investment account after a year is:

\[ \text{Investment return} = \left( n \times \frac{55}{12} \right) \times \frac{41}{11} \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ \text{Investment return} = n \times \frac{55}{12} \times \frac{41}{11} \]

\[ \text{Investment return} = n \times \frac{55 \times 41}{12 \times 11} \]

\[ \text{Investment return} = n \times \frac{2255}{132} \]

\[ \text{Investment return} = n \times \frac{2255}{132} \]

John now saves \(\frac{20}{15}\) of the money he needs every week. Let's simplify this fraction:

\[ \frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3} \]

So, John saves \(\frac{4}{3}\) of $11 each week:

\[ \text{Weekly savings} = \frac{4}{3} \times 11 = \frac{44}{3} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John has saved after \(n\) weeks. The total savings after \(n\) weeks would be:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Maria has left after buying the candy bar, we need to subtract the cost of the candy bar from the amount of money she initially had.

Maria starts with \(\frac{13}{3}\) euros and spends \(\frac{32}{15}\) euros.

First, we need a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The least common multiple of 3 and 15 is 15.

Convert \(\frac{13}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[
\frac{13}{3} = \frac{13 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{65}{15}
\]

Now, we can subtract \(\frac{32}{15}\) from \(\frac{65}{15}\):
\[
\frac{65}{15} - \frac{32}{15} = \frac{65 - 32}{15} = \frac{33}{15}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{33}{15}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
\[
\frac{33 \div 3}{15 \div 3} = \frac{11}{5}

Next, convert 12 to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[
12 = \frac{12 \times 15}{1 \times 15} = \frac{180}{15}

Now, we can subtract \(\frac{32}{15}\) from \(\frac{180}{15}\):
\[

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total length of 20 pieces of lumber, each 45/44 meters long, we need to multiply the length of one piece by the number of pieces.

First, let's write down the given information:
- Length of one piece of lumber: \( \frac{45}{44} \) meters
- Number of pieces: 20

Now, we calculate the total length:
\[
\text{Total length} = 20 \times \frac{45}{44}
\]

We can perform the multiplication:
\[
20 \times \frac{45}{44} = \frac{20 \times 45}{44} = \frac{900}{44}

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{900}{44} \):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total length of 20 pieces of the newly cut lumber, each 25/34 meters long, we need to multiply the length of one piece by the number of pieces.

First, let's write down the given information:
- Length of one newly cut piece of lumber: \( \frac{25}{34} \) meters
- Number of pieces: 20

Now, we calculate the total length:
\[
\text{Total length} = 20 \times \frac{25}{34}
\]

We can perform the multiplication:
\[
20 \times \frac{25}{34} = \frac{20 \times 25}{34} = \frac{500}{34}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{500}{34} \):
\[
\frac{500}{34} = \frac{250}{17}
\]

Thus, the total length of 20 pieces of the newly cut lumber is \( \frac{250}{17} \) meters.

            A sprinter runs two sections of a race. The first part is run at a speed of 34 miles per 14 hours, and the second part is run at a speed of 21 miles per 26 hours. How much distance does the sprinter cover in one hour from both parts together?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the distance the sprinter covers in one hour from both parts together, we need to calculate the speed for each part and then sum them up.

First, let's find the speed for each part of the race:

1. For the first part:
   - Speed = Distance / Time
   - Speed = 34 miles / 14 hours
   - Speed = 34 / 14 miles per hour
   - Simplifying the fraction: 34 / 14 = 17 / 7 miles per hour

2. For the second part:
   - Speed = Distance / Time
   - Speed = 21 miles / 26 hours
   - Speed = 21 / 26 miles per hour
   - Simplifying the fraction: 21 / 26 = 21 / 26 miles per hour (this fraction is already in its simplest form)

Now, we add the two speeds together to find the total distance covered in one hour:

- Total speed = (17 / 7) + (21 / 26) miles per hour

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 26 is 182.

- Convert 17 / 7 to a fraction with a denominator of 182:
  - (17 / 7) * (26 / 26) = 442 / 182

- Convert 21 / 26 to a fraction with a denominator of 182:
  - (21 / 26) * (7 / 7) = 147 / 182

Now, add the two fractions:

- Total speed = 442 / 182 + 147 / 182
- Total speed = (442 + 147) / 182
- Total speed = 589 / 182 miles per hour

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total distance the sprinter covers in one hour with the new speed for the first part of the race, we need to calculate the new speed for the first part and then sum it with the speed for the second part.

1. For the first part with the new speed:
   - Speed = 20 miles / 14 hours
   - Speed = 20 / 14 miles per hour
   - Simplifying the fraction: 20 / 14 = 10 / 7 miles per hour

2. For the second part (unchanged):
   - Speed = 21 miles / 26 hours
   - Speed = 21 / 26 miles per hour

Now, we add the two speeds together to find the total distance covered in one hour:

- Total speed = (10 / 7) + (21 / 26) miles per hour

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 26 is 182.

- Convert 10 / 7 to a fraction with a denominator of 182:
  - (10 / 7) * (26 / 26) = 260 / 182

- Convert 21 / 26 to a fraction with a denominator of 182:
  - (21 / 26) * (7 / 7) = 147 / 182

Now, add the two fractions:

- Total speed = 260 / 182 + 147 / 182

The least common denominator (LCD) of 32 and 4 is 32. We need to convert \( \frac{11}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 32.

\[ \frac{11}{4} = \frac{11 \times 8}{4 \times 8} = \frac{88}{32} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:

So, the total time spent riding is:

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine how many acres of land were not fallow. The farmer has 42 acres of land in total and lets 49/4 acres lie fallow.

To find the number of acres not fallow, we subtract the fallow acres from the total acres:
\[ 42 - \frac{49}{4} \]

First, convert 42 to a fraction with a common denominator of 4:
\[ 42 = \frac{42 \times 4}{4} = \frac{168}{4} \]

Now, perform the subtraction:
\[ \frac{168}{4} - \frac{49}{4} = \frac{168 - 49}{4} = \frac{119}{4} \]

So, the farmer has \(\frac{119}{4}\) acres of land that are not fallow.

Next, we need to calculate the total bushels of corn harvested from the land that was not fallow. The farmer harvested \(\frac{16}{5}\) bushels of corn per acre.

Multiply the number of bushels per acre by the number of acres not fallow:
\[ \frac{16}{5} \times \frac{119}{4} \]

To multiply these fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
\[ \frac{16 \times 119}{5 \times 4} = \frac{1904}{20} \]

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
\[ \frac{1904 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{476}{5} \]

So, the farmer harvests \(\frac{476}{5}\) bushels of corn from the land that was not fallow.

            Suppose, however, the farmer initially had 30 acres of land instead of 42 before letting 49/4 acres lie fallow. How many bushels of corn could the farmer have harvested from the land that was not fallow in this scenario?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine how many acres of land were not fallow. The farmer initially has 30 acres of land and lets 49/4 acres lie fallow.

To find the number of acres not fallow, we subtract the fallow acres from the total acres:
\[ 30 - \frac{49}{4} \]

First, convert 30 to a fraction with a common denominator of 4:
\[ 30 = \frac{30 \times 4}{4} = \frac{120}{4} \]

Now, perform the subtraction:
\[ \frac{120}{4} - \frac{49}{4} = \frac{120 - 49}{4} = \frac{71}{4} \]

So, the farmer has \(\frac{71}{4}\) acres of land that are not fallow.

Next, we need to calculate the total bushels of corn harvested from the land that was not fallow. The farmer harvested \(\frac{16}{5}\) bushels of corn per acre.

Multiply the number of bushels per acre by the number of acres not fallow:
\[ \frac{16}{5} \times \frac{71}{4} \]

To multiply these fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
\[ \frac{16 \times 71}{5 \times 4} = \frac{1136}{20} \]

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
\[ \frac{1136 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{284}{5} \]

So, the farmer harvests \(\frac{284}{5}\) bushels of corn from the land that was not fallow.

            Jennifer is selling lemonade for a fundraiser. Every jug she sells contains 21 gallons of lemonade. Due to evaporation, when she sells the jugs she only receives 31/34 of the volume she originally had. How much lemonade does Jennifer have after selling a full jug?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much lemonade Jennifer has after selling a full jug, we need to calculate 31/34 of the original 21 gallons.

First, we set up the multiplication:
\[
\text{Lemonade after selling} = 21 \times \frac{31}{34}
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[
21 \times \frac{31}{34} = \frac{21 \times 31}{34}
\]

Calculate the numerator:
\[
21 \times 31 = 651
\]

So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{651}{34}
\]

Now, we perform the division:
\[
\frac{651}{34} \approx 19.147
\]

Thus, Jennifer has approximately 19.147 gallons of lemonade after selling a full jug.

\[ \text{Distance} = 11 \, \text{km/h} \times 45 \, \text{hours} \]

            George had $21 in his wallet, then he found a bundle of change on the street worth $21/39. How much money does George have now?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the value of the bundle of change that George found. The value of the bundle is given by:

\[
\frac{21}{39}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 21 and 39. The GCD of 21 and 39 is 3. Therefore, we can simplify the fraction as follows:

\[
\frac{21 \div 3}{39 \div 3} = \frac{7}{13}
\]

So, the value of the bundle of change is \(\frac{7}{13}\) dollars.

Next, we add this amount to the $21 that George already had:

\[
21 + \frac{7}{13}
\]

To add these, we convert 21 to a fraction with a denominator of 13:

\[
21 = \frac{21 \times 13}{13} = \frac{273}{13}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{273}{13} + \frac{7}{13} = \frac{273 + 7}{13} = \frac{280}{13}
\]

Finally, we convert \(\frac{280}{13}\) back to a decimal to find the total amount of money George has:

\[
\frac{280}{13} \approx 21.54

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how much Jack earned from recycling cans. He earned \(\frac{41}{48}\) of a dollar.

Next, let's determine how much Jack found on the ground. He found a quarter, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a dollar.

Now, let's convert \(\frac{1}{4}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 48 to make it easier to add. We know that:
\[
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1 \times 12}{4 \times 12} = \frac{12}{48}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{41}{48} + \frac{12}{48} = \frac{41 + 12}{48} = \frac{53}{48}
\]

Next, we convert \(\frac{53}{48}\) to a decimal to add it to Jack's initial amount of money. We perform the division:
\[
\frac{53}{48} \approx 1.1042

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine Jenny's original speed in miles per hour. Given that her speed is \( \frac{32}{24} \) miles per hour, we can simplify this fraction:

\[
\frac{32}{24} = \frac{4 \times 8}{4 \times 6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance Jenny could travel at this speed over 29 hours:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ miles per hour} \times 29 \text{ hours} = \frac{4 \times 29}{3} = \frac{116}{3} \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we need to determine her new speed if it increases by a factor of \( \frac{43}{15} \):

\[
\text{New Speed} = \text{Original Speed} \times \text{Factor} = \frac{4}{3} \times \frac{43}{15} = \frac{4 \times 43}{3 \times 15} = \frac{172}{45} \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Finally, we calculate the distance Jenny could travel at this new speed over the same 29 hours:

\[
\text{New Distance} = \text{New Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{172}{45} \text{ miles per hour} \times 29 \text{ hours} = \frac{172 \times 29}{45} = \frac{4988}{45} \text{ miles}

Simplifying the fraction:

\[
\frac{4988}{45} \approx 110.8444 \text{ miles}

Each child received \( \frac{16}{31} \) liters of paint, and there are 32 children in the class. Therefore, the total amount of paint distributed is:

\[
32 \times \frac{16}{31}
\]

First, we perform the multiplication:

\[
32 \times 16 = 512
\]

So, the total amount of paint is:

\[
\frac{512}{31}

To simplify, we can perform the division:

\[
512 \div 31 \approx 16.5161

            In the previous art class scenario, suppose that there were originally 40 students instead of 32. If each student still received 16/31 liters of paint initially, then what would be the total amount of paint distributed to all students initially?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of paint distributed to all the students, we need to multiply the amount of paint each child received by the number of children in the class.

Each child received \( \frac{16}{31} \) liters of paint, and there are 40 children in the class. Therefore, the total amount of paint distributed is:

\[
40 \times \frac{16}{31}
\]

First, we perform the multiplication:

\[
40 \times 16 = 640
\]

So, the total amount of paint is:

\[
\frac{640}{31}
\]

To simplify, we can perform the division:

\[
640 \div 31 \approx 20.6452
\]

Thus, the total amount of paint distributed to all the students is approximately \( 20.6452 \) liters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much money Bob has in total, we need to add the amount he already has to the amount he received.

1. Bob initially has $3.
2. He receives an additional \(\frac{3}{7}\) of a dollar.

We add these two amounts together:
\[
3 + \frac{3}{7}
\]

To add these, we can convert 3 into a fraction with the same denominator as \(\frac{3}{7}\):
\[
3 = \frac{21}{7}
\]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{21}{7} + \frac{3}{7} = \frac{21 + 3}{7} = \frac{24}{7}

            Tom moved two rocks today. The first rock was moved for an interval of 20/50 hours, and the second was moved for an interval of 45/36 hours. If Tom can move rocks at a speed of 25/22 miles per hour, how far in miles did he move the rocks today?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how far Tom moved the rocks today, we need to calculate the total time he spent moving the rocks and then use his speed to find the distance.

First, let's simplify the time intervals for each rock.

1. The first rock was moved for an interval of \( \frac{20}{50} \) hours:
\[ \frac{20}{50} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ hours} \]

2. The second rock was moved for an interval of \( \frac{45}{36} \) hours:
\[ \frac{45}{36} = \frac{5}{4} \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add these two time intervals to find the total time Tom spent moving the rocks:
\[ \frac{2}{5} + \frac{5}{4} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20. We convert each fraction:
\[ \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 4}{5 \times 4} = \frac{8}{20} \]
\[ \frac{5}{4} = \frac{5 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{25}{20} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{8}{20} + \frac{25}{20} = \frac{33}{20} \text{ hours} \]

Tom's speed is \( \frac{25}{22} \) miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the total time by his speed:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Time} \times \text{Speed} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{33}{20} \times \frac{25}{22} \]

We multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{33 \times 25}{20 \times 22} = \frac{825}{440} \]

We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 825 and 440, which is 55:
\[ \frac{825 \div 55}{440 \div 55} = \frac{15}{8} \]

Thus, the distance Tom moved the rocks today is:
\[ \frac{15}{8} \text{ miles} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how far Tom moved the rocks with the updated time for the second rock, we need to recalculate the total time he spent moving the rocks and then use his speed to find the distance.

First, let's simplify the time intervals for each rock.

1. The first rock was moved for an interval of \( \frac{20}{50} \) hours:
\[ \frac{20}{50} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ hours} \]

2. The second rock was moved for an interval of \( \frac{45}{9} \) hours:
\[ \frac{45}{9} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add these two time intervals to find the total time Tom spent moving the rocks:
\[ \frac{2}{5} + 5 \]

To add these, we convert \( 5 \) to a fraction with a denominator of 5:
\[ 5 = \frac{5 \times 5}{1 \times 5} = \frac{25}{5} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{2}{5} + \frac{25}{5} = \frac{27}{5} \text{ hours} \]

Tom's speed is \( \frac{25}{22} \) miles per hour. To find the distance, we multiply the total time by his speed:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Time} \times \text{Speed} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{27}{5} \times \frac{25}{22} \]

We multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{27 \times 25}{5 \times 22} = \frac{675}{110} \]

We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 675 and 110, which is 5:
\[ \frac{675 \div 5}{110 \div 5} = \frac{135}{22} \]

Thus, the distance Tom moved the rocks today is:
\[ \frac{135}{22} \text{ miles} \]

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fractions involved in the problem.

1. Simplify \( \frac{10}{42} \):
\[ \frac{10}{42} = \frac{5}{21} \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{4}{28} \):
\[ \frac{4}{28} = \frac{1}{7} \]

Now, let's calculate the total initial mixture:
\[ \text{Total mixture} = \frac{5}{21} \text{ liters of solution A} + 32 \text{ liters of solution B} \]

To combine these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 21 and 1 is 21:
\[ 32 = \frac{32 \times 21}{21} = \frac{672}{21} \]

So, the total mixture in terms of a common denominator is:
\[ \frac{5}{21} + \frac{672}{21} = \frac{5 + 672}{21} = \frac{677}{21} \]

Next, we remove \( \frac{1}{7} \) liters from this mixture. To do this, we need to convert \( \frac{1}{7} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 21:
\[ \frac{1}{7} = \frac{3}{21} \]

Subtracting this from the total mixture:
\[ \frac{677}{21} - \frac{3}{21} = \frac{677 - 3}{21} = \frac{674}{21} \]

Now, the scientist extracts \( \frac{11}{29} \) of the remaining mixture for the experiment:
\[ \text{Amount extracted} = \frac{11}{29} \times \frac{674}{21} \]

To multiply these fractions:
\[ \frac{11 \times 674}{29 \times 21} = \frac{7414}{609} \]

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{7414}{609} \):
\[ \frac{7414 \div 7}{609 \div 7} = \frac{1059.142857}{87} \approx 12.18 \]

Thus, the scientist uses approximately 12.18 liters of the mixture for her experiment.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of juice from both containers.
2. Subtract the amount drunk by the customer.
3. Determine how much space is left in the bottle.

First, let's add the amounts of juice in the two containers:

\[
\frac{23}{35} + \frac{50}{41}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 35 and 41 is 1435. We convert each fraction:

\[
\frac{23}{35} = \frac{23 \times 41}{35 \times 41} = \frac{943}{1435}
\]

\[
\frac{50}{41} = \frac{50 \times 35}{41 \times 35} = \frac{1750}{1435}
\]

Now, add the fractions:

\[
\frac{943}{1435} + \frac{1750}{1435} = \frac{943 + 1750}{1435} = \frac{2693}{1435}
\]

Next, subtract the amount drunk by the customer:

\[
\frac{2693}{1435} - \frac{11}{19}
\]

Convert \(\frac{11}{19}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 1435:

\[
\frac{11}{19} = \frac{11 \times 75}{19 \times 75} = \frac{825}{1435}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{2693}{1435} - \frac{825}{1435} = \frac{2693 - 825}{1435} = \frac{1868}{1435}
\]

Convert \(\frac{1868}{1435}\) to a mixed number:

\[
\frac{1868}{1435} = 1 + \frac{433}{1435}
\]

So, the total amount of juice left is \(1 + \frac{433}{1435}\) gallons.

Finally, determine the space left in the 28-gallon bottle:

\[
28 - \left(1 + \frac{433}{1435}\right) = 27 + \left(1 - \frac{433}{1435}\right) = 27 + \frac{1002}{1435}
\]

Convert \(\frac{1002}{1435}\) to a decimal:

\[
\frac{1002}{1435} \approx 0.698
\]

So, the space left in the bottle is approximately:

\[
27 + 0.698 = 27.698 \text{ gallons}
\]

1. The additional fee for a custom design is given as $6 divided by the 26 available designs. We calculate this as follows:

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 (which can be written as \( \frac{129}{43} \)) and \( \frac{50}{43} \) is 43.

\[ \frac{129}{43} - \frac{50}{43} = \frac{129 - 50}{43} = \frac{79}{43} \]

So, the drone can fly \( \frac{79}{43} \) kilometers when carrying a package.

Next, we need to add the additional distance provided by the booster, which is \( \frac{47}{15} \) kilometers.

\[ \frac{79}{43} + \frac{47}{15} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 43 and 15 is 645.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 645:

\[ \frac{79}{43} = \frac{79 \times 15}{43 \times 15} = \frac{1185}{645} \]
\[ \frac{47}{15} = \frac{47 \times 43}{15 \times 43} = \frac{2021}{645} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{1185}{645} + \frac{2021}{645} = \frac{1185 + 2021}{645} = \frac{3206}{645} \]

Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3206 and 645. The GCD is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the drone can fly \( \frac{3206}{645} \) kilometers with the package and the additional booster attached.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many kilometers Ann runs in a day, we need to add the distance she runs in the morning to the distance she runs in the evening.

First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The denominators are 18 and 9. The least common multiple of 18 and 9 is 18.

The morning distance is already in terms of 18:
\[ \frac{43}{18} \]

The evening distance needs to be converted:
\[ \frac{22}{9} = \frac{22 \times 2}{9 \times 2} = \frac{44}{18} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{43}{18} + \frac{44}{18} = \frac{43 + 44}{18} = \frac{87}{18} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{87}{18} = \frac{87 \div 3}{18 \div 3} = \frac{29}{6} \]

So, Ann runs \( \frac{29}{6} \) kilometers in a day.

As calculated previously:
\[ \frac{43}{18} + \frac{44}{18} = \frac{87}{18} = \frac{29}{6} \]

Next, we need to convert her daily goal of 20 kilometers into a fraction with the same denominator as \(\frac{29}{6}\). The least common multiple of 1 and 6 is 6, so:
\[ 20 = \frac{20 \times 6}{1 \times 6} = \frac{120}{6} \]

Now, we subtract the distance she already runs from her daily goal:
\[ \frac{120}{6} - \frac{29}{6} = \frac{120 - 29}{6} = \frac{91}{6} \]

So, Ann needs to run \(\frac{91}{6}\) more kilometers to meet her daily goal.

First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The denominators are 12 and 9. The least common multiple of 12 and 9 is 36.

Convert the morning distance:
\[ \frac{43}{12} = \frac{43 \times 3}{12 \times 3} = \frac{129}{36} \]

Convert the evening distance:
\[ \frac{22}{9} = \frac{22 \times 4}{9 \times 4} = \frac{88}{36} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{129}{36} + \frac{88}{36} = \frac{129 + 88}{36} = \frac{217}{36} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we calculate the distance John drove in the first 36 hours. He drove 18 miles each hour for 36 hours:

\[ 18 \text{ miles/hour} \times 36 \text{ hours} = 648 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the extra distance he drove, which is \( \frac{32}{45} \) miles:

\[ 648 \text{ miles} + \frac{32}{45} \text{ miles} \]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The whole number 648 can be written as a fraction with a denominator of 45:

\[ 648 = \frac{648 \times 45}{45} = \frac{29160}{45} \]

Now, we add the fractions:

\[ \frac{29160}{45} + \frac{32}{45} = \frac{29160 + 32}{45} = \frac{29192}{45} \]

Finally, we convert this fraction back to a decimal or a mixed number if needed. Dividing 29192 by 45:

\[ 29192 \div 45 = 648.7111 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of coins Hannah has after correcting her count, we need to multiply the number of piggy banks by the corrected number of coins in each piggy bank.

Hannah has 5 piggy banks, and each piggy bank contains 27 coins. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

So, after correcting her count, Hannah has a total of 135 coins.

            Alex has $13/10 in his pocket. He finds $47/36 on the floor and picks it up adding to the money he already has. If he duplicates the amount of money he has by 43 times, how much money will he have?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's add the amounts of money Alex has:

Alex initially has \(\frac{13}{10}\) dollars. He finds \(\frac{47}{36}\) dollars. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 36 is 180.

Convert \(\frac{13}{10}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 180:
\[
\frac{13}{10} = \frac{13 \times 18}{10 \times 18} = \frac{234}{180}
\]

Convert \(\frac{47}{36}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 180:
\[
\frac{47}{36} = \frac{47 \times 5}{36 \times 5} = \frac{235}{180}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{234}{180} + \frac{235}{180} = \frac{234 + 235}{180} = \frac{469}{180}
\]

Next, Alex duplicates this amount by 43 times:
\[
43 \times \frac{469}{180} = \frac{43 \times 469}{180} = \frac{20167}{180}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{20167}{180}\), we can perform the division:
\[
20167 \div 180 \approx 112.0388889
\]

Thus, the amount of money Alex will have is approximately 112.0388889 dollars.

### Answer: \(\frac{20167}{180}\) or approximately 112.0388889 dollars.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the amount Alex ended up with after adding his pocket money to the amount he picked up from the floor. This amount was \(\frac{469}{180}\).

Next, we need to multiply the final amount Alex had after duplicating his money by 43 times, which was \(\frac{20167}{180}\), by the original amount \(\frac{469}{180}\).

The multiplication of these two fractions is:
\[
\frac{20167}{180} \times \frac{469}{180} = \frac{20167 \times 469}{180 \times 180}
\]

Calculate the numerator:
\[
20167 \times 469 = 9468223
\]

Calculate the denominator:
\[
180 \times 180 = 32400
\]

Thus, the resulting fraction is:
\[
\frac{9468223}{32400}
\]

To simplify, we can perform the division:
\[
9468223 \div 32400 \approx 292.2769753
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Alex ends up with is approximately 292.2769753 dollars.

            Richard bought a bottle of wine that had 33 ounces in it. He drank 33/48 of the wine. In the morning, he drank a cup of orange juice that contained 26/30 of a liter. After a few hours, he drank a bottle of water that contained 2/36 of a liter. What is the total volume of the liquid he consumed?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the amount of wine Richard drank. The bottle contained 33 ounces, and he drank \( \frac{33}{48} \) of it.

\[
\text{Wine consumed} = 33 \times \frac{33}{48} = \frac{33 \times 33}{48} = \frac{1089}{48} \approx 22.6875 \text{ ounces}
\]

Next, let's convert the orange juice and water from liters to ounces. We know that 1 liter is approximately 33.814 ounces.

For the orange juice:
\[
\text{Orange juice consumed} = \frac{26}{30} \text{ liters} = \frac{26}{30} \times 33.814 \approx 29.325 \text{ ounces}
\]

For the water:
\[
\text{Water consumed} = \frac{2}{36} \text{ liters} = \frac{2}{36} \times 33.814 \approx 1.878 \text{ ounces}
\]

Now, let's sum up the total volume of liquid Richard consumed:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 22.6875 \text{ ounces (wine)} + 29.325 \text{ ounces (orange juice)} + 1.878 \text{ ounces (water)}
\]

\[
\text{Total volume} \approx 22.6875 + 29.325 + 1.878 = 53.8905 \text{ ounces}

\[

So, Jacob receives $3 from his aunt.

Next, let's add the amounts together. Jacob initially has $43 in his savings account. He adds $46 to this amount:

\[
43 + 46 = 89

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Tina paid for the groceries after the discount, we need to calculate 16/26 of the original amount she spent, which is $39.

First, simplify the fraction 16/26:
\[ \frac{16}{26} = \frac{8}{13} \]

Now, calculate 8/13 of $39:
\[ \frac{8}{13} \times 39 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ \frac{8 \times 39}{13} \]

Calculate the numerator:
\[ 8 \times 39 = 312 \]

Now, divide by the denominator:
\[ \frac{312}{13} = 24 \]

So, Tina paid $24 for the groceries after the discount.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption, we need to compare the quantities he consumes over a common time period. Let's first convert all quantities to a common unit and then find the rate.

1. **Convert pounds of apples to ounces:**
   - There are 16 ounces in a pound.
   - John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days.
   - Therefore, the total weight of apples in ounces is:
     \[
     17 \text{ pounds} \times 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 272 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of apples:**
   - John consumes 272 ounces of apples every 8 days.
   - Therefore, his daily consumption of apples is:
     \[
     \frac{272 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ days}} = 34 \text{ ounces/day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily consumption of apple juice:**
   - John consumes 48 ounces of apple juice every 42 days.
   - Therefore, his daily consumption of apple juice is:
     \[
     \frac{48 \text{ ounces}}{42 \text{ days}} \approx 1.14 \text{ ounces/day}
     \]

4. **Calculate the rate of apple to apple juice consumption:**
   - The rate of apple to apple juice consumption is the ratio of daily apple consumption to daily apple juice consumption:
     \[
     \frac{34 \text{ ounces/day}}{1.14 \text{ ounces/day}} \approx 29.82
     \]

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's calculate the total distance Maria drove. She drove for 8 hours at a speed of \( \frac{4}{7} \) miles per hour.

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = \frac{4}{7} \times 8 = \frac{32}{7} \text{ miles}
\]

Next, let's determine how much money Maria spent on gas. She initially had 38 dollars and spent \( \frac{50}{4} \) dollars on gas.

\[
\text{Amount spent on gas} = \frac{50}{4} = 12.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, let's find the remaining amount of money she had for gas.

\[
\text{Remaining money} = 38 - 12.5 = 25.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we need to find the summation of the total miles driven and the remaining amount of money.

\[
\text{Summation} = \frac{32}{7} + 25.5
\]

First, convert 25.5 to a fraction with a common denominator of 7:

\[
25.5 = \frac{25.5 \times 7}{7} = \frac{178.5}{7}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{32}{7} + \frac{178.5}{7} = \frac{32 + 178.5}{7} = \frac{210.5}{7} = 30.07

1. **Time traveled by car:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{31} \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Time traveled by bus:**
   \[
   \frac{30}{12} \text{ hours}

   Simplify \(\frac{30}{12}\):
   \[

3. **Break time:**

   \]

Now, we add these times together. To do this, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 31, 2, and 4. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 124.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 124:

- \(\frac{1}{31}\):
  \[
  \frac{1}{31} = \frac{1 \times 4}{31 \times 4} = \frac{4}{124}

- \(\frac{5}{2}\):
  \[
  \frac{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 62}{2 \times 62} = \frac{310}{124}

- \(\frac{17}{4}\):
  \[
  \frac{17}{4} = \frac{17 \times 31}{4 \times 31} = \frac{527}{124}

Now, add these fractions:
\[
\frac{4}{124} + \frac{310}{124} + \frac{527}{124} = \frac{4 + 310 + 527}{124} = \frac{841}{124}

Simplify \(\frac{841}{124}\):

            In a certain village, the well is 45 miles away. However, every hour, a donkey can carry water back from the well, effectively reducing the distance by 18/33 miles. After 1 hour, what is the effective distance of the well from the village?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the effective distance of the well from the village after 1 hour, we need to calculate how much the distance is reduced by the donkey's travel.

First, let's simplify the fraction 18/33:
\[ \frac{18}{33} = \frac{18 \div 3}{33 \div 3} = \frac{6}{11} \]

So, the donkey reduces the distance by \(\frac{6}{11}\) miles every hour.

Initially, the well is 45 miles away. After 1 hour, the effective distance is:
\[ 45 - \frac{6}{11} \]

To subtract these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 45 and \(\frac{6}{11}\) is 11:
\[ 45 = \frac{45 \times 11}{11} = \frac{495}{11} \]

Now, subtract \(\frac{6}{11}\) from \(\frac{495}{11}\):
\[ \frac{495}{11} - \frac{6}{11} = \frac{495 - 6}{11} = \frac{489}{11} \]

Finally, convert \(\frac{489}{11}\) back to a decimal:
\[ \frac{489}{11} \approx 44.4545 \]

So, the effective distance of the well from the village after 1 hour is approximately 44.4545 miles.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how much money Clara had left after buying the ice cream.

Clara initially had 30 dollars and spent \( \frac{25}{6} \) dollars on ice cream. We need to subtract the amount spent on ice cream from her initial amount:

\[ 30 - \frac{25}{6} \]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 30 and \( \frac{25}{6} \) is 6. We can rewrite 30 as \( \frac{180}{6} \):

\[ \frac{180}{6} - \frac{25}{6} = \frac{180 - 25}{6} = \frac{155}{6} \]

So, Clara had \( \frac{155}{6} \) dollars left after buying the ice cream.

Next, Clara used \( \frac{11}{21} \) of her remaining money to buy a book. We need to calculate \( \frac{11}{21} \) of \( \frac{155}{6} \):

\[ \frac{11}{21} \times \frac{155}{6} \]

To multiply these fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators:

\[ \frac{11 \times 155}{21 \times 6} = \frac{1705}{126} \]

We can simplify \( \frac{1705}{126} \) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1705 and 126. The GCD is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, Clara spent \( \frac{1705}{126} \) dollars on the book.

            Suppose Clara initially had 27 dollars instead of 30. She spent 25/6 dollars on ice cream and then used 11/21 of her remaining money to buy a book. How many dollars did she spend on the book?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how much money Clara had left after buying the ice cream.

Clara initially had 27 dollars and spent \( \frac{25}{6} \) dollars on ice cream. We need to subtract the amount spent on ice cream from her initial amount:

\[ 27 - \frac{25}{6} \]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 27 and \( \frac{25}{6} \) is 6. We can rewrite 27 as \( \frac{162}{6} \):

\[ \frac{162}{6} - \frac{25}{6} = \frac{162 - 25}{6} = \frac{137}{6} \]

So, Clara had \( \frac{137}{6} \) dollars left after buying the ice cream.

Next, Clara used \( \frac{11}{21} \) of her remaining money to buy a book. We need to calculate \( \frac{11}{21} \) of \( \frac{137}{6} \):

\[ \frac{11}{21} \times \frac{137}{6} \]

To multiply these fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators:

\[ \frac{11 \times 137}{21 \times 6} = \frac{1507}{126} \]

We can simplify \( \frac{1507}{126} \) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1507 and 126. The GCD is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, Clara spent \( \frac{1507}{126} \) dollars on the book.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Walter had originally, we need to add the cost of the pen to the amount of money he has left after buying the pen.

1. The cost of the pen is \(\frac{23}{21}\) dollars.
2. The amount of money Walter has left is 46 dollars.

We add these two amounts together to find the total amount of money Walter had originally:

\[
\text{Total amount} = \frac{23}{21} + 46
\]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 21 and 1 is 21. We convert 46 to a fraction with a denominator of 21:

\[
46 = \frac{46 \times 21}{21} = \frac{966}{21}
\]

Now we add the fractions:

\[
\frac{23}{21} + \frac{966}{21} = \frac{23 + 966}{21} = \frac{989}{21}
\]

Thus, Walter originally had \(\frac{989}{21}\) dollars. Converting this to a decimal:

\[
\frac{989}{21} \approx 47.0952

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much Walter spends in total on the additional stationary items, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Walter had originally.
2. Determine how many times he can buy stationary items worth the same amount as the pen.
3. Calculate the total expenditure on these additional stationary items.

From the previous problem, we found that Walter originally had \(\frac{989}{21}\) dollars.

The cost of one pen (or one stationary item) is \(\frac{23}{21}\) dollars.

To find out how many times Walter can buy stationary items worth the same amount as the pen, we divide the total amount of money he had originally by the cost of one pen:

\[
\text{Number of times} = \frac{\frac{989}{21}}{\frac{23}{21}} = \frac{989}{23}
\]

Now, we calculate \(\frac{989}{23}\):

\[
\frac{989}{23} = 43
\]

This means Walter can buy 43 additional stationary items.

Next, we calculate the total expenditure on these additional stationary items:

\[
\text{Total expenditure} = 43 \times \frac{23}{21}
\]

Since \(\frac{23}{21}\) is the cost of one stationary item, multiplying it by 43 gives:

\[
43 \times \frac{23}{21} = \frac{43 \times 23}{21} = \frac{989}{21}
\]

Thus, Walter spends \(\frac{989}{21}\) dollars in total on the additional stationary items.

The average amount of honey harvested from each beehive is \( \frac{44}{10} \) kilograms. There are 37 beehives.

Total honey harvested in a day:
\[
\text{Total honey} = \left( \frac{44}{10} \right) \times 37

Simplify \( \frac{44}{10} \):
\[
\frac{44}{10} = 4.4

Next, we need to find out how many kilograms of honey the farmer sells if he sells \( \frac{3}{37} \) of the total honey harvested in a day.

Amount of honey sold:
\[

First, we calculate the total fuel consumption:
\[
\text{Total fuel consumption} = \frac{41}{39} \times 47
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{41}{39} \times 47 = \frac{41 \times 47}{39}
\]

Now, we calculate \( 41 \times 47 \):
\[
41 \times 47 = 1927
\]

So, the total fuel consumption is:
\[
\frac{1927}{39}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we perform the division:
\[
1927 \div 39 \approx 49.41
\]

Thus, Tim will have consumed approximately 49.41 liters of fuel.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            A cargo ship carries 17 / 26 tons of cargo for every one of its 39 containers. It already has an existing cargo load of 50 / 11 tons. What is the total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after it loads all 39 containers?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after it loads all 39 containers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cargo carried by the 39 containers.
2. Add the existing cargo load to the total cargo from the containers.

First, let's calculate the total cargo carried by the 39 containers:
Each container carries \( \frac{17}{26} \) tons of cargo. Therefore, for 39 containers, the total cargo is:
\[
39 \times \frac{17}{26}
\]

We can simplify this multiplication:
\[
39 \times \frac{17}{26} = \frac{39 \times 17}{26}
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication in the numerator:
\[
39 \times 17 = 663
\]

So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{663}{26}
\]

Now, we simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{663}{26} \approx 25.5 \text{ tons}
\]

Next, we add the existing cargo load of \( \frac{50}{11} \) tons to the total cargo from the containers:
\[
25.5 + \frac{50}{11}
\]

First, convert 25.5 to a fraction with a common denominator of 11:
\[
25.5 = \frac{255}{10} = \frac{2805}{110}
\]

Now, convert \( \frac{50}{11} \) to a fraction with a common denominator of 110:
\[
\frac{50}{11} = \frac{500}{110}
\]

Add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{2805}{110} + \frac{500}{110} = \frac{3305}{110}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{3305}{110} = 30.045 \text{ tons}
\]

            A man spends 43 dollars on groceries but gets a discount of 43/27 dollars. Later, he buys a book worth 13/36 dollars. How much money did he spend in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's calculate the discount the man received on the groceries. The discount is given by:

\[
\frac{43}{27} \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we subtract this discount from the original amount spent on groceries:

\[
43 - \frac{43}{27}
\]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 43 and \(\frac{43}{27}\) is 27. We can rewrite 43 as:

\[
43 = \frac{43 \times 27}{27} = \frac{1161}{27}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{1161}{27} - \frac{43}{27} = \frac{1161 - 43}{27} = \frac{1118}{27}
\]

So, the amount spent on groceries after the discount is:

\[
\frac{1118}{27} \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we add the cost of the book, which is \(\frac{13}{36}\) dollars. To add these two amounts, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 27 and 36 is 108. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{1118}{27} = \frac{1118 \times 4}{27 \times 4} = \frac{4472}{108}
\]

\[
\frac{13}{36} = \frac{13 \times 3}{36 \times 3} = \frac{39}{108}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{4472}{108} + \frac{39}{108} = \frac{4472 + 39}{108} = \frac{4511}{108}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the man spent is:

\[
\frac{4511}{108} \text{ dollars}

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's calculate the discount the man received on the groceries, which remains:

\[
\frac{43}{27} \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we subtract this discount from the new amount spent on groceries, which is 9 dollars:

\[
9 - \frac{43}{27}
\]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 9 and \(\frac{43}{27}\) is 27. We can rewrite 9 as:

\[
9 = \frac{9 \times 27}{27} = \frac{243}{27}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{243}{27} - \frac{43}{27} = \frac{243 - 43}{27} = \frac{200}{27}
\]

So, the amount spent on groceries after the discount is:

Next, we add the cost of the book, which is \(\frac{13}{36}\) dollars. To add these two amounts, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 27 and 36 is 108. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

\]

\[
\frac{13}{36} = \frac{13 \times 3}{36 \times 3} = \frac{39}{108}

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{800}{108} + \frac{39}{108} = \frac{800 + 39}{108} = \frac{839}{108}

Thus, the total amount of money the man spent is:

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fractions involved:

1. Simplify \( \frac{27}{6} \):
   \[
   \frac{27}{6} = \frac{27 \div 3}{6 \div 3} = \frac{9}{2}
   \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{5}{40} \):
   \[
   \frac{5}{40} = \frac{5 \div 5}{40 \div 5} = \frac{1}{8}
   \]

3. Simplify \( \frac{21}{26} \):
   This fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we perform the operations step-by-step:

1. Start with \( \frac{9}{2} \) gallons of water in the tank.

2. Pour out \( \frac{1}{8} \) gallons:
   \[
   \frac{9}{2} - \frac{1}{8}
   \]
   To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 8 is 8.
   \[
   \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9 \times 4}{2 \times 4} = \frac{36}{8}
   \]
   Now subtract:
   \[
   \frac{36}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{36 - 1}{8} = \frac{35}{8}
   \]

3. Add \( \frac{21}{26} \) gallons:
   \[
   \frac{35}{8} + \frac{21}{26}
   \]
   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 26 is 104.
   \[
   \frac{35}{8} = \frac{35 \times 13}{8 \times 13} = \frac{455}{104}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{21}{26} = \frac{21 \times 4}{26 \times 4} = \frac{84}{104}
   \]
   Now add:
   \[
   \frac{455}{104} + \frac{84}{104} = \frac{455 + 84}{104} = \frac{539}{104}
   \]

Finally, simplify \( \frac{539}{104} \):
   \[
   \frac{539}{104} \text{ is already in its simplest form.}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fractions involved:

1. Simplify \( \frac{27}{6} \):
   \[
   \frac{27}{6} = \frac{27 \div 3}{6 \div 3} = \frac{9}{2}
   \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{5}{19} \):
   This fraction is already in its simplest form.

3. Simplify \( \frac{21}{26} \):
   This fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we perform the operations step-by-step:

1. Start with \( \frac{9}{2} \) gallons of water in the tank.

2. Pour out \( \frac{5}{19} \) gallons:
   \[
   \frac{9}{2} - \frac{5}{19}
   \]
   To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 19 is 38.
   \[
   \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9 \times 19}{2 \times 19} = \frac{171}{38}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5}{19} = \frac{5 \times 2}{19 \times 2} = \frac{10}{38}
   \]
   Now subtract:
   \[
   \frac{171}{38} - \frac{10}{38} = \frac{171 - 10}{38} = \frac{161}{38}
   \]

3. Add \( \frac{21}{26} \) gallons:
   \[
   \frac{161}{38} + \frac{21}{26}
   \]
   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 38 and 26 is 494.
   \[
   \frac{161}{38} = \frac{161 \times 13}{38 \times 13} = \frac{2093}{494}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{21}{26} = \frac{21 \times 19}{26 \times 19} = \frac{399}{494}
   \]
   Now add:
   \[
   \frac{2093}{494} + \frac{399}{494} = \frac{2093 + 399}{494} = \frac{2492}{494}
   \]

Finally, simplify \( \frac{2492}{494} \):
   \[
   \frac{2492}{494} = \frac{2492 \div 2}{494 \div 2} = \frac{1246}{247}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1246}{247} = \frac{1246 \div 247}{247 \div 247} = \frac{5}{1} = 5
   \]

            A sports car travels at a speed of 40 miles per hour on a highway. Additional to that, it gains an extra speed of 26/24 miles every hour due to a powerful wind from behind. What would be its speed after one hour with the effect of the wind included?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the sports car's speed after one hour, we need to add the base speed of the car to the additional speed gained from the wind.

1. The base speed of the car is 40 miles per hour.
2. The additional speed gained from the wind is \( \frac{26}{24} \) miles per hour.

First, simplify the fraction \( \frac{26}{24} \):
\[ \frac{26}{24} = \frac{13}{12} \]

Now, add this additional speed to the base speed:
\[ 40 + \frac{13}{12} \]

To add these, convert 40 to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[ 40 = \frac{40 \times 12}{12} = \frac{480}{12} \]

Now add the fractions:
\[ \frac{480}{12} + \frac{13}{12} = \frac{480 + 13}{12} = \frac{493}{12} \]

Convert the fraction back to a decimal to find the speed in miles per hour:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of milk James has in the jug, we need to add the two quantities of milk together. 

First, let's write down the fractions:
- Initial amount of milk: \( \frac{33}{37} \) gallons
- Additional milk: \( \frac{3}{25} \) gallons

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 37 and 25 is 925.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
- For \( \frac{33}{37} \):
  \[
  \frac{33}{37} = \frac{33 \times 25}{37 \times 25} = \frac{825}{925}
  \]

- For \( \frac{3}{25} \):
  \[
  \frac{3}{25} = \frac{3 \times 37}{25 \times 37} = \frac{111}{925}
  \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{825}{925} + \frac{111}{925} = \frac{825 + 111}{925} = \frac{936}{925}

Thus, the total amount of milk James has in the jug is \( \frac{936}{925} \) gallons.

\[
\text{Total amount of milk} = 30 \times \frac{936}{925}
\]

We can simplify this multiplication:

\[
30 \times \frac{936}{925} = \frac{30 \times 936}{925} = \frac{28080}{925}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{28080}{925} \), we can perform the division:

\[
28080 \div 925 \approx 30.36

1. Carrie's car consumes 41 liters of fuel per hour.
2. She has driven for \( \frac{49}{48} \) hours.

We calculate the total fuel consumption as follows:
\[

Next, calculate the numerator:
\[
41 \times 49 = 2009

So, the expression becomes:

To simplify, we can perform the division:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much money Jenny has altogether, we need to add the value of the rare coin to the $3 she already has.

First, let's convert the fraction to a decimal for easier addition:
\[ \frac{4}{37} \approx 0.1081 \]

Now, add this value to the $3:
\[ 3 + 0.1081 = 3.1081 \]

So, Jenny has approximately $3.1081 altogether.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            You have $15 in your savings account. You decided to spend 17/23 of a dollar on a small sweet. How much is left in your savings account after buying the sweet?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money is left in your savings account after buying the sweet, we need to subtract the cost of the sweet from the initial amount in your savings account.

1. Initial amount in the savings account: $15
2. Cost of the sweet: \( \frac{17}{23} \) of a dollar

First, let's convert the cost of the sweet to a decimal for easier subtraction:
\[ \frac{17}{23} \approx 0.7391 \]

Now, subtract the cost of the sweet from the initial amount:
\[ 15 - 0.7391 = 14.2609 \]

So, the amount left in your savings account after buying the sweet is approximately $14.2609.
