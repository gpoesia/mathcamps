            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of tickets issued, we need to multiply the number of tickets issued each day by the number of days.

Number of tickets issued each day = 65
Number of days = 34

Total tickets issued = 65 tickets/day * 34 days

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 65 \times 34 = 65 \times (30 + 4) = (65 \times 30) + (65 \times 4) \]

First, calculate \( 65 \times 30 \):

\[ 65 \times 30 = 1950 \]

Next, calculate \( 65 \times 4 \):

\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \]

Now, add the two results together:

\[ 1950 + 260 = 2210 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of keys produced, we need to multiply the number of keys produced per day by the number of days.

Number of keys produced per day = 96
Number of days = 83

Total number of keys produced = 96 keys/day * 83 days

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
96 \times 83 = 96 \times (80 + 3) = (96 \times 80) + (96 \times 3)
\]

First, calculate \(96 \times 80\):

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of pirouettes the ballerina has performed with the increased number, we need to multiply the new number of pirouettes she performs each day by the number of days she performs them.

Given:
- Number of pirouettes per day = 3075
- Number of days = 21

We calculate the total number of pirouettes as follows:
\[ 3075 \times 21 \]

First, we can break this multiplication into simpler parts:
\[ 3075 \times 21 = 3075 \times (20 + 1) \]
\[ = 3075 \times 20 + 3075 \times 1 \]
\[ = 3075 \times 20 + 3075 \]
\[ = 61500 + 3075 \]
\[ = 64575 \]

So, the ballerina has performed a total of 64575 pirouettes over 21 days.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of windows in the building with 4633 floors, each having 18 windows, we need to multiply the number of floors by the number of windows per floor.

Given:
- Number of floors = 4633
- Number of windows per floor = 18

We perform the multiplication:
\[ 4633 \times 18 \]

First, we can break it down using the distributive property:
\[ 4633 \times 18 = 4633 \times (10 + 8) \]
\[ = 4633 \times 10 + 4633 \times 8 \]

Now, calculate each part:
\[ 4633 \times 10 = 46330 \]
\[ 4633 \times 8 = 37064 \]

Add the two results together:
\[ 46330 + 37064 = 83394 \]

Thus, the total number of windows in the entire building is:

            A telescope magnifies an object 67 times and each magnification adds 86 units to the object's size. What is the total size of the object with added magnification?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total size of the object with added magnification, we need to calculate the total increase in size due to the magnification and then add this to the original size of the object.

Given:
- The telescope magnifies the object 67 times.
- Each magnification adds 86 units to the object's size.

First, calculate the total increase in size due to the magnification:
\[ \text{Total increase} = 67 \times 86 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 67 \times 86 = 67 \times (80 + 6) = (67 \times 80) + (67 \times 6) \]
\[ 67 \times 80 = 5360 \]
\[ 67 \times 6 = 402 \]
\[ 5360 + 402 = 5762 \]

Thus, the total increase in size due to the magnification is 5762 units. 

If we assume the original size of the object is \( S \), the total size of the object with added magnification is:
\[ S + 5762 \]

However, since the original size \( S \) is not provided, we can only state the increase in size due to magnification.

Given:
- The telescope magnifies the object 67 times.
- The original size of the object is 58 units.

First, calculate the total increase in size due to the magnification:
\[ \text{Total increase} = 67 \times 58 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 67 \times 58 = 67 \times (50 + 8) = (67 \times 50) + (67 \times 8) \]
\[ 67 \times 50 = 3350 \]
\[ 67 \times 8 = 536 \]
\[ 3350 + 536 = 3886 \]

Thus, the total increase in size due to the magnification is 3886 units.

Now, add this increase to the original size of the object:

\[ 97 \times 97 = 97^2 \]

We can use the formula for the square of a number:

\[ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \]

Here, \( a = 90 \) and \( b = 7 \):

\[ 97^2 = (90 + 7)^2 = 90^2 + 2 \cdot 90 \cdot 7 + 7^2 \]

Calculating each term:

\[ 90^2 = 8100 \]
\[ 2 \cdot 90 \cdot 7 = 2 \cdot 630 = 1260 \]
\[ 7^2 = 49 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 8100 + 1260 + 49 = 9409 \]

So, the total number of pieces of wood used is:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of pieces of wood used, we need to multiply the number of pieces of wood per chair by the number of chairs designed.

Given:
- Pieces of wood per chair = 269
- Number of chairs = 97

Total pieces of wood used = 269 pieces/chair * 97 chairs

Let's calculate this:

\[ 269 \times 97 \]

We can break this multiplication into simpler parts using the distributive property:

\[ 269 \times 97 = 269 \times (100 - 3) = 269 \times 100 - 269 \times 3 \]

Calculating each term:

\[ 269 \times 100 = 26900 \]
\[ 269 \times 3 = 807 \]

Now, subtract the second term from the first:

\[ 26900 - 807 = 26093 \]

So, the total number of pieces of wood used is:

- Number of phones produced per hour = 3458
- Number of hours = 9

We perform the multiplication:
\[ 3458 \times 9 \]

Let's break it down step-by-step:
\[ 3458 \times 9 = (3000 + 400 + 50 + 8) \times 9 \]
\[ = 3000 \times 9 + 400 \times 9 + 50 \times 9 + 8 \times 9 \]
\[ = 27000 + 3600 + 450 + 72 \]
\[ = 27000 + 3600 + 450 + 72 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of stitches across all 9 hats, we need to multiply the number of stitches per hat by the number of hats.

Each hat has 3084 stitches, and there are 9 hats. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 3084 \times 9 \]

Let's perform the multiplication step-by-step:

\[ 3084 \times 9 = (3000 + 80 + 4) \times 9 \]

First, multiply each term by 9:

\[ 3000 \times 9 = 27000 \]
\[ 80 \times 9 = 720 \]
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

Now, add these results together:

\[ 27000 + 720 + 36 = 27756 \]

So, the total number of stitches across all 9 hats is:

First, we can break down the multiplication for easier calculation:

Given that the length is 18 miles and the width is 2898 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \times 2898 \]

To simplify the multiplication, we can break it down:

\[ 18 \times 2898 = 18 \times (2900 - 2) = 18 \times 2900 - 18 \times 2 \]

Calculating each part separately:

\[ 18 \times 2900 = 18 \times (29 \times 100) = (18 \times 29) \times 100 \]
\[ 18 \times 29 = 522 \]
\[ 522 \times 100 = 52200 \]

And:

\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

Now, subtract the second part from the first part:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total number of grapes produced by the farm in a day, we need to multiply the number of clusters by the number of grapes per cluster.

Given:
- Number of clusters per day = 60
- Number of grapes per cluster = 64

We calculate the total number of grapes as follows:
\[ \text{Total grapes} = \text{Number of clusters} \times \text{Number of grapes per cluster} \]
\[ \text{Total grapes} = 60 \times 64 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 60 \times 64 = 3840 \]
