        Maria has 37 cents in nickels. After spending 12 cents on bubblegum, how much does she have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how many nickels Maria has. Each nickel is worth 5 cents. 

To find the number of nickels:
\[ \text{Number of nickels} = \frac{37 \text{ cents}}{5 \text{ cents per nickel}} = 7.4 \]

Since Maria cannot have a fraction of a nickel, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement. Let's assume Maria has 35 cents in nickels (which is a multiple of 5).

Now, let's calculate how much she has left after spending 12 cents:
\[ 35 \text{ cents} - 12 \text{ cents} = 23 \text{ cents} \]

### Answer: 23 cents</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how much money Mario has after spending $3 on a snack. 

Starting amount: $79
Amount spent on snack: $3

\[ 79 - 3 = 76 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the video game from the remaining amount.

Remaining amount after snack: $76
Cost of the video game: $72

\[ 76 - 72 = 4 \]

So, Mario has $4 left after buying the video game.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much money Marie now has in total, we need to add the amounts she has received and earned to her initial savings.

1. Marie's initial savings: $19
2. Money received from her grandma: $32
3. Money earned from mowing a neighbor's lawn: $14

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[ 19 + 32 + 14 \]

First, add $19 and $32:

She then earned an additional $14 from mowing a neighbor's lawn. She finds out that she needs to pay back her friend $32 she borrowed last week. After paying her friend, how much money does Marie have left?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Marie has left after paying back her friend, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Marie initially has:
   - Initial savings: $19
   - Birthday gift from grandma: $32
   - Earnings from mowing the lawn: $14

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[ 19 + 32 + 14 = 65 \]

2. Subtract the amount she needs to pay back to her friend:
   - Total money before paying back: $65
   - Amount to pay back to her friend: $32

   Subtracting the amount she needs to pay back:
   \[ 65 - 32 = 33 \]

So, after paying her friend, Marie has $33 left.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Marie now has in total after the changes, we need to add the new amounts she has received and earned to her initial savings.

1. Marie's initial savings: $19
2. Money received from her grandma: $13 (instead of $32)
3. Money earned from mowing a neighbor's lawn: $14

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[ 19 + 13 + 14 \]

First, add $19 and $13:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Next, add the result to $14:
\[ 32 + 14 = 46 \]

So, after the changes, Marie now has a total of $46.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much money Eddie has in total, we need to add up all the amounts he has received and saved.

1. Eddie has $26 in his piggy bank.
2. His aunt gives him $6 for his birthday.
3. His parents give him $62 for doing well in school.

We add these amounts together:

\[ 26 + 6 + 62 \]

First, add $26 and $6:

\[ 26 + 6 = 32 \]

Next, add the result to $62:

\[ 32 + 62 = 94 \]

First, add the $6 from his aunt to the $26 Eddie has:

        After buying the toy car, Jerry notices a toy airplane he also wants. The toy airplane costs 26 quarters. If Jerry buys the toy airplane as well, how many quarters will he have left?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many quarters Jerry will have left after buying both the toy car and the toy airplane, we need to subtract the total number of quarters he spends from the total number of quarters he initially had.

Jerry initially has 39 quarters.
He spends 9 quarters on the toy car, leaving him with:
\[ 39 - 9 = 30 \] quarters.

Next, he spends 26 quarters on the toy airplane. So, we subtract this from the remaining quarters:
\[ 30 - 26 = 4 \]

        Larry has $42 in his savings account. He takes out $16 to buy a new book. In total, he then receives $37 from his parents for helping them with household chores. The next day Larry spends $38 on a video game. How much money does Larry have left now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine how much money Larry has after taking out $16 from his savings account.

Starting amount: $42
Amount taken out: $16

\[ 42 - 16 = 26 \]

So, Larry has $26 left in his savings account after buying the book.

Next, we add the $37 he received from his parents to the remaining amount in his savings account.

Remaining amount: $26
Amount received from parents: $37

\[ 26 + 37 = 63 \]

Now, we need to subtract the $38 he spent on a video game from the current amount.

Current amount: $63
Amount spent on video game: $38

\[ 63 - 38 = 25 \]

Therefore, Larry now has $25 left in his savings account.

Liam has $72 and the video game costs $41. We calculate the change as follows:

Next, Liam's brother gives him an amount equal to the change he received, which is also $31.

To find out how much money Liam has now, we add the change he received and the amount his brother gave him to the remaining money after the purchase:
\[ 31 + 31 = 62 \]

Therefore, after the purchase and receiving money from his brother, Liam has:
\[ 41 (cost of the video game) + 62 (total additional money) = 72 \]

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much change Liam should get back, we need to subtract the cost of the video game from the amount of money he has saved.

Liam has saved $97 and the video game costs $41.

We perform the subtraction:

        Shay has a total of 93 dollars. He decides to buy a video game for 59 dollars. After the purchase, his friend borrows some money from him, giving back another 13 dollars in return. How much money does Shay have in total now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how much money Shay has after buying the video game. Shay starts with 93 dollars and spends 59 dollars on the video game:

\[ 93 - 59 = 34 \]

So, Shay has 34 dollars left after buying the video game.

Next, Shay's friend borrows some money from him but returns 13 dollars. Since the problem does not specify how much was borrowed, we only consider the 13 dollars returned. Therefore, Shay's total money after receiving the 13 dollars is:

\[ 34 + 13 = 47 \]
