Given:
- 12 pieces have been eaten.
- 1 piece is left.

Let's denote the total number of slices in the whole cake as \( h \).

Since 12 pieces have been eaten and 1 piece is left, the total number of slices \( h \) can be calculated as:
\[ h = 12 \text{ (eaten slices)} + 1 \text{ (remaining slice)} \]

So,
\[ h = 12 + 1 \]
\[ h = 13 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pairs of socks Anne originally had, we need to subtract the number of new pairs she bought from her current total.

Anne's current total number of pairs of socks is 20.
She bought 15 new pairs.

Let \( x \) be the number of pairs she originally had. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 15 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 15 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Anne originally had 5 pairs of socks.

According to the problem, if Oliver gives 19 bones to his friend, he would be left with only 1 bone. This can be expressed with the equation:

To find the value of \( o \), we need to solve this equation. We do this by adding 19 to both sides of the equation:
\[ o - 19 + 19 = 1 + 19 \]
\[ o = 20 \]

So, Oliver originally had 20 bones in his backyard.

The camper originally had 4 sleeping bags. After the friends dropped off their bags, there were 11 sleeping bags in total.

We calculate the number of sleeping bags the friends brought by subtracting the original number of sleeping bags from the total number:

\[ 11 - 4 = 7 \]

She originally had 7 cats.
After adopting stray cats, her total number of cats increased to 20.

According to the problem, after climbing down 4 feet, the climber reaches a point that is 10 feet high. This can be expressed with the equation:
\[ m - 4 = 10 \]

To find the starting height \( m \), we need to solve this equation for \( m \):

\[ m = 10 + 4 \]
\[ m = 14 \]

Given:
- John has 6 picks left.
- He lost 1 pick.

Let's denote the original number of guitar picks John had as \( x \).

According to the problem, after losing 1 pick, John has 6 picks left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x - 1 = 6 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 6 + 1 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many alarms the firefighter heard after lunch, we need to subtract the number of alarms he heard before lunch from the total number of alarms he heard in one day.

Given:
- Total number of alarms in one day = 6
- Number of alarms heard before lunch = 4

We can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Number of alarms after lunch} = \text{Total number of alarms} - \text{Number of alarms before lunch} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Number of alarms after lunch} = 6 - 4 \]

Performing the subtraction:
\[ \text{Number of alarms after lunch} = 2 \]

Initially, the snowman is built using 3 large snowballs.

After some time, the snowman grows and is comprised of a total of 4 large snowballs.

To find the number of additional snowballs added, we subtract the initial number of snowballs from the final number:

The Jackson family originally had 6 jackets. After purchasing more jackets at the yard sale, they now have a total of 12 jackets.

We can set up the equation:

Substituting the known values:
\[ 6 + \text{Purchased jackets} = 12 \]

Initially, the store had 1 bracelet in stock. After the shipment, the total number of bracelets increased to 4.

Initially, the backpack contains 3 pencils. After adding more pencils, the total count becomes 20 pencils.

Let's denote the number of additional pencils added as \( x \).

The equation representing this situation is:
\[ 3 + x = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 3 \]
\[ x = 17 \]

Therefore, the student added 17 additional pencils to the backpack.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many colored pencils were in the new pack, we need to subtract the number of colored pencils the artist originally had from the total number of colored pencils she has now.

The artist originally had 1 blue colored pencil. After adding the new pack, she now has 13 colored pencils.

Let's denote the number of colored pencils in the new pack as \( x \).

The equation to represent this situation is:
\[ 1 + x = 13 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 13 - 1 \]
\[ x = 12 \]

Therefore, the new pack contained 12 colored pencils.

The number of colors in a typical rainbow is 7.

According to the problem, a young giraffe was 1 meter shorter than a full grown giraffe when it was 3 meters tall. This can be expressed as:

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

Initially, there were 10 pencils in the box. After the student added some pencils, the total number of pencils became 14.

Let's denote the number of pencils added by the student as \( x \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ 10 + x = 14 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 14 - 10 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, the student added 4 pencils to the box.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many additional pepperoni pizzas were baked throughout the day, we start with the initial number of pizzas and the total number by the evening.

Initially, the pizzeria has 15 pepperoni pizzas. By the evening, the total number of pepperoni pizzas is 16.

We can find the number of additional pizzas baked by subtracting the initial number from the total number by the evening:

\[ \text{Additional pizzas baked} = \text{Total pizzas by evening} - \text{Initial pizzas} \]

\[ \text{Additional pizzas baked} = 16 - 15 \]

According to the problem, if 7 snowballs are removed, 11 snowballs remain. This can be expressed with the equation:
