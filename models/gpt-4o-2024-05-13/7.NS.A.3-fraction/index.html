            Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of cucumbers Carla can grow per plant, we need to follow the steps given in the problem.

First, we calculate the initial number of cucumbers per plant by multiplying \( \frac{22}{3} \) by \( \frac{22}{19} \):

\[
\frac{22}{3} \times \frac{22}{19} = \frac{22 \times 22}{3 \times 19} = \frac{484}{57}
\]

Next, Carla increases her production by multiplying the initial amount by \( \frac{23}{17} \):

\[
\frac{484}{57} \times \frac{23}{17} = \frac{484 \times 23}{57 \times 17}
\]

We now perform the multiplications in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
484 \times 23 = 11132
\]
\[
57 \times 17 = 969
\]

Thus, the number of cucumbers per plant after adjusting her production method is:

\[
\frac{11132}{969}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 11132 and 969. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

\[
11132 \div 969 \approx 11.49 \quad \text{(remainder 493)}
\]
\[
969 \div 493 \approx 1.97 \quad \text{(remainder 476)}
\]
\[
493 \div 476 \approx 1.03 \quad \text{(remainder 17)}
\]
\[
476 \div 17 = 28 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 17. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 17:

\[
\frac{11132 \div 17}{969 \div 17} = \frac{655}{57}
\]

Therefore, the number of cucumbers Carla is expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method is:

            Pierre has 19/4 kg of grapes. One afternoon, he ate 7/25 kg of them. In the evening, his mother gave him 30/9 kg more grapes. How many kilograms of grapes does Pierre have now?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many kilograms of grapes Pierre has now, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Subtract the amount of grapes Pierre ate from the initial amount he had.
2. Add the amount of grapes his mother gave him to the remaining amount.

First, let's convert all fractions to have a common denominator where necessary.

Initial amount of grapes: \( \frac{19}{4} \)

Amount of grapes Pierre ate: \( \frac{7}{25} \)

To subtract \( \frac{7}{25} \) from \( \frac{19}{4} \), we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 25 is 100.

Convert \( \frac{19}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 100:
\[ \frac{19}{4} = \frac{19 \times 25}{4 \times 25} = \frac{475}{100} \]

Convert \( \frac{7}{25} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 100:
\[ \frac{7}{25} = \frac{7 \times 4}{25 \times 4} = \frac{28}{100} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{475}{100} - \frac{28}{100} = \frac{475 - 28}{100} = \frac{447}{100} \]

Next, we add the amount of grapes his mother gave him: \( \frac{30}{9} \)

Convert \( \frac{30}{9} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 100:
\[ \frac{30}{9} = \frac{30 \times 11.1111}{9 \times 11.1111} = \frac{333.3333}{100} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{447}{100} + \frac{333.3333}{100} = \frac{780.3333}{100} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{780.3333}{100} = 7.803333 \]

            King Arthur is calculating the costs for restoring his castle. The wall repairs cost 26/22 of his castle's annual budget. Meanwhile, the moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget. Finally, installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget. How much (expressed as a fraction of the castle's annual budget) has King Arthur spent on these projects in total?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total fraction of the castle's annual budget that King Arthur has spent on these projects, we need to add the fractions representing each project's cost.

The fractions are:
- Wall repairs: \( \frac{26}{22} \)
- Moat renovations: \( \frac{4}{29} \)
- Defensive catapults: \( \frac{11}{3} \)

First, simplify the fraction for the wall repairs:
\[ \frac{26}{22} = \frac{13}{11} \]

Now, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The denominators are 11, 29, and 3. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 957.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 957:
\[ \frac{13}{11} = \frac{13 \times 87}{11 \times 87} = \frac{1131}{957} \]
\[ \frac{4}{29} = \frac{4 \times 33}{29 \times 33} = \frac{132}{957} \]
\[ \frac{11}{3} = \frac{11 \times 319}{3 \times 319} = \frac{3509}{957} \]

Now, add these fractions:
\[ \frac{1131}{957} + \frac{132}{957} + \frac{3509}{957} = \frac{1131 + 132 + 3509}{957} = \frac{4772}{957} \]

Simplify the resulting fraction:
\[ \frac{4772}{957} = \frac{4772 \div 239}{957 \div 239} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

            A giraffe at the local zoo has a peculiar eating habit. When it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves, it eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day. If the zoo calculates the weekly feeding amount by multiplying the daily intake by itself (making the result &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;) and then multiplying that with the regular daily intake, how many pounds of acacia leaves should they prepare for the giraffe for a week? Calculate ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26))^2 * ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26)) and provide your answer.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily intake of acacia leaves.
2. Square the daily intake to get the weekly feeding amount squared.
3. Multiply the weekly feeding amount squared by the daily intake to get the total weekly feeding amount.

First, let's calculate the daily intake:
\[
\text{Daily intake} = \left(\frac{25}{19}\right) \times \left(\frac{30}{26}\right)
\]

We can simplify this multiplication:
\[
\text{Daily intake} = \frac{25 \times 30}{19 \times 26} = \frac{750}{494}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{750}{494}\):
\[
\frac{750}{494} = \frac{375}{247} \quad \text{(dividing both numerator and denominator by 2)}
\]

Now, we square the daily intake to get the weekly feeding amount squared:
\[
\left(\frac{375}{247}\right)^2 = \frac{375^2}{247^2} = \frac{140625}{61009}
\]

Finally, we multiply the weekly feeding amount squared by the daily intake:
\[
\left(\frac{375}{247}\right)^2 \times \frac{375}{247} = \frac{140625}{61009} \times \frac{375}{247} = \frac{140625 \times 375}{61009 \times 247}
\]

Calculating the numerator and the denominator:
\[
140625 \times 375 = 52734375
\]
\[
61009 \times 247 = 15069223
\]

Thus, the total weekly feeding amount is:
\[
\frac{52734375}{15069223}

From the previous problem, we determined that the weekly feeding amount for one giraffe is:

Since there are two giraffes, we need to calculate:

1. Calculate the new daily intake of acacia leaves.
2. Square the daily intake to get the weekly feeding amount squared.
3. Multiply the weekly feeding amount squared by the daily intake to get the total weekly feeding amount.

First, let's calculate the new daily intake:
\[
\text{Daily intake} = \left(\frac{25}{19}\right) \times \left(\frac{27}{26}\right)
\]

We can simplify this multiplication:
\[
\text{Daily intake} = \frac{25 \times 27}{19 \times 26} = \frac{675}{494}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{675}{494}\):
\[
\frac{675}{494} = \frac{225}{164} \quad \text{(dividing both numerator and denominator by 3)}
\]

Now, we square the daily intake to get the weekly feeding amount squared:
\[
\left(\frac{225}{164}\right)^2 = \frac{225^2}{164^2} = \frac{50625}{26896}

Finally, we multiply the weekly feeding amount squared by the daily intake:
\[

Calculating the numerator and the denominator:
\[
50625 \times 225 = 11390625

\[
26896 \times 164 = 4410944

Thus, the total weekly feeding amount is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total length of materials Lara will need, we need to add the length of the yarn and the length added by the beads.

First, let's convert both fractions to have a common denominator to make the addition easier. The denominators are 3 and 30. The least common multiple of 3 and 30 is 30.

Convert \(\frac{11}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 30:
\[
\frac{11}{3} = \frac{11 \times 10}{3 \times 10} = \frac{110}{30}

Now, we can add \(\frac{110}{30}\) and \(\frac{8}{30}\):
\[
\frac{110}{30} + \frac{8}{30} = \frac{110 + 8}{30} = \frac{118}{30}

We can simplify \(\frac{118}{30}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{118 \div 2}{30 \div 2} = \frac{59}{15}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total length of materials Lara will need with the added larger beads, we need to add the previous total length of materials to the length required for the larger beads.

From the previous calculation, the total length of materials without the larger beads is \(\frac{59}{15}\) feet. The additional length required for the larger beads is \(\frac{24}{17}\) feet.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 15 and 17. The least common multiple of 15 and 17 is 255.

Convert \(\frac{59}{15}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 255:
\[
\frac{59}{15} = \frac{59 \times 17}{15 \times 17} = \frac{1003}{255}
\]

Convert \(\frac{24}{17}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 255:
\[
\frac{24}{17} = \frac{24 \times 15}{17 \times 15} = \frac{360}{255}

Now, we can add \(\frac{1003}{255}\) and \(\frac{360}{255}\):
\[
\frac{1003}{255} + \frac{360}{255} = \frac{1003 + 360}{255} = \frac{1363}{255}

            Lara realized that she made a slight miscalculation. The amount of smaller beads she wants to add to the necklace extends its length by (8/28) feet not by (8/30) feet as she initially thought. Given this new information, how many total feet of material will Lara need to make her necklace, before adding the larger beads?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total length of materials Lara will need with the corrected length of the smaller beads, we need to add the length of the yarn and the corrected length added by the beads.

First, let's convert both fractions to have a common denominator to make the addition easier. The denominators are 3 and 28. The least common multiple of 3 and 28 is 84.

Convert \(\frac{11}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 84:
\[
\frac{11}{3} = \frac{11 \times 28}{3 \times 28} = \frac{308}{84}
\]

Convert \(\frac{8}{28}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 84:
\[
\frac{8}{28} = \frac{8 \times 3}{28 \times 3} = \frac{24}{84}
\]

Now, we can add \(\frac{308}{84}\) and \(\frac{24}{84}\):
\[
\frac{308}{84} + \frac{24}{84} = \frac{308 + 24}{84} = \frac{332}{84}
\]

We can simplify \(\frac{332}{84}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
\[
\frac{332 \div 4}{84 \div 4} = \frac{83}{21}
\]

Thus, the total length of materials Lara will need is \(\frac{83}{21}\) feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much farther Plane A traveled than Plane B after exactly one minute, we need to calculate the distance each plane traveled in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by Plane A in one minute:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by Plane A} = \frac{24}{11} \text{ miles per minute} \times 1 \text{ minute} = \frac{24}{11} \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by Plane B in one minute:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by Plane B} = \frac{26}{27} \text{ miles per minute} \times 1 \text{ minute} = \frac{26}{27} \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances traveled by Plane A and Plane B:
\[ \text{Difference} = \frac{24}{11} - \frac{26}{27} \]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 27 is 297. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{24}{11} = \frac{24 \times 27}{11 \times 27} = \frac{648}{297} \]
\[ \frac{26}{27} = \frac{26 \times 11}{27 \times 11} = \frac{286}{297} \]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[ \frac{648}{297} - \frac{286}{297} = \frac{648 - 286}{297} = \frac{362}{297} \]

The fraction \(\frac{362}{297}\) can be simplified by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 362 and 297. The GCD of 362 and 297 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the time it takes Toby to play each song.

For the first song:
\[ \frac{12}{8} = \frac{12 \div 4}{8 \div 4} = \frac{3}{2} \text{ hours} \]

For the second song:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to add the time for the third song, which is \(\frac{19}{14}\) hours.

Convert \(\frac{11}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 14:

Now add the fractions:

Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 15, which is 3:
\[ \frac{12 \div 3}{15 \div 3} = \frac{4}{5} \text{ hours} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the total number of chocolate bars you have.

You initially have 28 out of 29 chocolate bars. This can be written as:
\[ \frac{28}{29} \]

Next, you found 8 out of 22 more chocolate bars. This can be written as:
\[ \frac{8}{22} \]

To find the total number of chocolate bars, we need to add these two fractions. First, we simplify the second fraction:

Now, we need a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple of 29 and 11 is 319. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{28}{29} = \frac{28 \times 11}{29 \times 11} = \frac{308}{319} \]
\[ \frac{4}{11} = \frac{4 \times 29}{11 \times 29} = \frac{116}{319} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{308}{319} + \frac{116}{319} = \frac{308 + 116}{319} = \frac{424}{319} \]

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the amount of material needed to produce two identical needles. Each needle requires \( \frac{27}{26} \) pounds of material.

For two needles:
\[
2 \times \frac{27}{26} = \frac{54}{26} = \frac{27}{13} \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, the additional piece requires \( \frac{27}{6} \) pounds of material.

Now, we need to find the total material required for both the needles and the additional piece:
\[
\frac{27}{13} + \frac{27}{6}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 6 is 78.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 78:
\[
\frac{27}{13} = \frac{27 \times 6}{13 \times 6} = \frac{162}{78}
\]
\[
\frac{27}{6} = \frac{27 \times 13}{6 \times 13} = \frac{351}{78}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{162}{78} + \frac{351}{78} = \frac{162 + 351}{78} = \frac{513}{78}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{513}{78} = \frac{513 \div 3}{78 \div 3} = \frac{171}{26}
\]

Thus, the total material required is:
\[
\frac{171}{26} \text{ pounds}

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous scenario, the compass maker originally used 27/6 pounds of material to produce an additional piece for the compass.

Now, suppose that the compass maker has found a way to redesign this additional piece to reduce the material requirement to 22/6 pounds instead. 

If the maker is still trying to produce two identical needles with each needing 27/26 pounds of material, how much total material will the compass maker need now to produce the two needles and the redesigned additional piece?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the amount of material needed to produce two identical needles. Each needle requires \( \frac{27}{26} \) pounds of material.

For two needles:
\[
2 \times \frac{27}{26} = \frac{54}{26} = \frac{27}{13} \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, the redesigned additional piece requires \( \frac{22}{6} \) pounds of material.

Now, we need to find the total material required for both the needles and the redesigned additional piece:
\[
\frac{27}{13} + \frac{22}{6}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 6 is 78.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 78:
\[
\frac{27}{13} = \frac{27 \times 6}{13 \times 6} = \frac{162}{78}
\]
\[
\frac{22}{6} = \frac{22 \times 13}{6 \times 13} = \frac{286}{78}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{162}{78} + \frac{286}{78} = \frac{162 + 286}{78} = \frac{448}{78}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{448}{78} = \frac{448 \div 2}{78 \div 2} = \frac{224}{39}
\]

Thus, the total material required is:
\[
\frac{224}{39} \text{ pounds}
\]

            Liam bought a candle that burns at a rate of 6/4 inches per hour. After some time, he bought another candle that burns at a slower rate of 14/16 inches per hour. What is the total rate at which the two candles burn together?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the rates at which each candle burns.

For the first candle:
\[ \frac{6}{4} \]
We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[ \frac{6 \div 2}{4 \div 2} = \frac{3}{2} \]

For the second candle:
\[ \frac{14}{16} \]
We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[ \frac{14 \div 2}{16 \div 2} = \frac{7}{8} \]

Now, we need to find the total rate at which the two candles burn together. To do this, we add the two simplified rates:
\[ \frac{3}{2} + \frac{7}{8} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 8 is 8. We convert \(\frac{3}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 8:
\[ \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3 \times 4}{2 \times 4} = \frac{12}{8} \]

Now we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{12}{8} + \frac{7}{8} = \frac{12 + 7}{8} = \frac{19}{8} \]

So, the total rate at which the two candles burn together is:
\[ \frac{19}{8} \] inches per hour.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Sophia has now, we need to add the amounts she received from her friend and her brother to the amount she initially had.

1. Sophia initially has \(\frac{17}{20}\) of a dollar.
2. Her friend gives her \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a dollar.

First, we need to add these two fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 4 is 20.

Convert \(\frac{1}{4}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 20:
\[
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{5}{20}
\]

Now add \(\frac{17}{20}\) and \(\frac{5}{20}\):
\[
\frac{17}{20} + \frac{5}{20} = \frac{17 + 5}{20} = \frac{22}{20}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{22}{20}\):
\[
\frac{22}{20} = \frac{11}{10} = 1.1

3. Her brother gives her 1 dollar.

Now add this to the previous total:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Sophia spent on the new toy, we need to calculate \(\frac{10}{14}\) of the total amount of money she has, which is 2.1 dollars.

First, simplify the fraction \(\frac{10}{14}\):

\frac{10}{14} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Now, calculate \(\frac{5}{7}\) of 2.1 dollars:
\[
\frac{5}{7} \times 2.1
\]

Convert 2.1 to a fraction for easier multiplication:
\[
2.1 = \frac{21}{10}
\]

Now multiply the fractions:
\[
\frac{5}{7} \times \frac{21}{10} = \frac{5 \times 21}{7 \times 10} = \frac{105}{70}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{105}{70}\):
\[
\frac{105}{70} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5

So, Sophia spent 1.5 dollars on the new toy.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Sophia has now, we need to add the amounts she received from her friend and her brother to the amount she initially had.

1. Sophia initially has \(\frac{17}{19}\) of a dollar.
2. Her friend gives her \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a dollar.

First, we need to add these two fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 19 and 4 is 76.

Convert \(\frac{17}{19}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\) to fractions with a denominator of 76:
\[
\frac{17}{19} = \frac{17 \times 4}{19 \times 4} = \frac{68}{76}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1 \times 19}{4 \times 19} = \frac{19}{76}

Now add \(\frac{68}{76}\) and \(\frac{19}{76}\):
\[
\frac{68}{76} + \frac{19}{76} = \frac{68 + 19}{76} = \frac{87}{76}

Simplify \(\frac{87}{76}\):
\[
\frac{87}{76} = 1 + \frac{11}{76} = 1.144736842105263

3. Her brother gives her 1 dollar.

            Imagine you're a music producer who is working on a new song. Your resources are divided into different sections.

- First, you dedicate 16/4 hours to composing the music and another 16/29 hours to writing the lyrics. This is your initial time investment for the song (let's call it p).

- Then, you spend 28/13 hours for mixing and mastering the song in addition to the initial time investment (let's call this new total time b).

- Suddenly, a drummer you hired for a session uses 18/4 hours less because he finished his parts quickly.

What is the final time you spent on producing the song, if your total time is expressed as (b - (18 / 4))?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Time Investment (p):**
   - Time spent composing the music: \( \frac{16}{4} \) hours
   - Time spent writing the lyrics: \( \frac{16}{29} \) hours

   Calculate the total initial time investment \( p \):
   \[
   p = \frac{16}{4} + \frac{16}{29}
   \]

   Simplify \( \frac{16}{4} \):
   \[
   \frac{16}{4} = 4
   \]

   So,
   \[
   p = 4 + \frac{16}{29}
   \]

2. **Total Time Including Mixing and Mastering (b):**
   - Additional time for mixing and mastering: \( \frac{28}{13} \) hours

   Calculate the new total time \( b \):
   \[
   b = p + \frac{28}{13}
   \]

   Substitute \( p \) into the equation:
   \[
   b = 4 + \frac{16}{29} + \frac{28}{13}
   \]

3. **Final Time After Drummer's Adjustment:**
   - Drummer's time reduction: \( \frac{18}{4} \) hours

   Calculate the final time:
   \[
   \text{Final Time} = b - \frac{18}{4}
   \]

   Substitute \( b \) into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Final Time} = \left( 4 + \frac{16}{29} + \frac{28}{13} \right) - \frac{18}{4}
   \]

4. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - Convert all fractions to a common denominator if necessary.

   First, find a common denominator for \( \frac{16}{29} \) and \( \frac{28}{13} \):
   \[
   \text{Common denominator} = 29 \times 13 = 377
   \]

   Convert \( \frac{16}{29} \) and \( \frac{28}{13} \) to have the common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{16}{29} = \frac{16 \times 13}{29 \times 13} = \frac{208}{377}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{28}{13} = \frac{28 \times 29}{13 \times 29} = \frac{812}{377}
   \]

   Combine the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{208}{377} + \frac{812}{377} = \frac{208 + 812}{377} = \frac{1020}{377}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   b = 4 + \frac{1020}{377}
   \]

   Now, convert \( 4 \) to a fraction with the same denominator:
   \[
   4 = \frac{4 \times 377}{377} = \frac{1508}{377}
   \]

   Combine:
   \[
   b = \frac{1508}{377} + \frac{1020}{377} = \frac{2528}{377}
   \]

   Now, subtract the drummer's time:
   \[
   \frac{18}{4} = 4.5
   \]

   Convert \( 4.5 \) to a fraction with the same denominator:
   \[
   4.5 = \frac{4.5 \times 377}{377} = \frac{1696.5}{377}
   \]

   Subtract:
   \[
   \text{Final Time} = \frac{2528}{377} - \frac{1696.5}{377} = \frac{831.5}{377}
   \]

   Simplify the fraction if possible:
   \[
   \frac{831.5}{377} = 2.205
   \]

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the total number of dozens of cookies Monica has before increasing her stock. We start by adding the two fractions:

\[
\frac{21}{15} + \frac{29}{17}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 17 is 255. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{21}{15} = \frac{21 \times 17}{15 \times 17} = \frac{357}{255}
\]

\[
\frac{29}{17} = \frac{29 \times 15}{17 \times 15} = \frac{435}{255}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{357}{255} + \frac{435}{255} = \frac{357 + 435}{255} = \frac{792}{255}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{792}{255}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 792 and 255, which is 3:

\[
\frac{792 \div 3}{255 \div 3} = \frac{264}{85}
\]

So, Monica has \(\frac{264}{85}\) dozens of cookies before increasing her stock. Now, she decides to increase her total stock by a ratio of \(\frac{7}{5}\):

\[
\frac{264}{85} \times \frac{7}{5} = \frac{264 \times 7}{85 \times 5} = \frac{1848}{425}
\]

We simplify the fraction \(\frac{1848}{425}\). The GCD of 1848 and 425 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, Monica will have \(\frac{1848}{425}\) dozens of cookies for the cookie festival.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the total number of dozens of cookies Monica has before increasing her stock. We start by adding the two fractions:

\[
\frac{21}{15} + \frac{29}{26}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 26 is 390. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{21}{15} = \frac{21 \times 26}{15 \times 26} = \frac{546}{390}
\]

\[
\frac{29}{26} = \frac{29 \times 15}{26 \times 15} = \frac{435}{390}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{546}{390} + \frac{435}{390} = \frac{546 + 435}{390} = \frac{981}{390}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{981}{390}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 981 and 390, which is 3:

\[
\frac{981 \div 3}{390 \div 3} = \frac{327}{130}
\]

So, Monica has \(\frac{327}{130}\) dozens of cookies before increasing her stock. Now, she decides to increase her total stock by a ratio of \(\frac{7}{5}\):

\[
\frac{327}{130} \times \frac{7}{5} = \frac{327 \times 7}{130 \times 5} = \frac{2289}{650}
\]

We simplify the fraction \(\frac{2289}{650}\). The GCD of 2289 and 650 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, Monica will have \(\frac{2289}{650}\) dozens of cookies for the event.

            In a bakery, a certain cake recipe requires 26/24 kg of sugar per cake. If a chef starts with 28 kg of sugar, how many kilograms of sugar will they have left after making one cake and then adding 10/6 kg of sugar to their supply?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how much sugar is used to make one cake. The recipe requires \( \frac{26}{24} \) kg of sugar per cake. We can simplify this fraction:

\[
\frac{26}{24} = \frac{13}{12} \text{ kg}
\]

Next, the chef starts with 28 kg of sugar. After making one cake, the amount of sugar left is:

\[
28 - \frac{13}{12}
\]

To subtract these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 28 and \( \frac{13}{12} \) is 12. We convert 28 to a fraction with a denominator of 12:

\[
28 = \frac{28 \times 12}{12} = \frac{336}{12}
\]

Now, we subtract \( \frac{13}{12} \) from \( \frac{336}{12} \):

\[
\frac{336}{12} - \frac{13}{12} = \frac{336 - 13}{12} = \frac{323}{12}
\]

Next, the chef adds \( \frac{10}{6} \) kg of sugar to their supply. We simplify \( \frac{10}{6} \):

\[
\frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

We need a common denominator to add \( \frac{323}{12} \) and \( \frac{5}{3} \). The common denominator for 12 and 3 is 12. We convert \( \frac{5}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 12:

\[
\frac{5}{3} = \frac{5 \times 4}{3 \times 4} = \frac{20}{12}
\]

Now, we add \( \frac{323}{12} \) and \( \frac{20}{12} \):

\[
\frac{323}{12} + \frac{20}{12} = \frac{323 + 20}{12} = \frac{343}{12}
\]

Finally, we simplify \( \frac{343}{12} \):

\[
\frac{343}{12} \approx 28.5833 \text{ kg}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously determined that after making one cake and adding \( \frac{10}{6} \) kg of sugar, the chef has \( \frac{343}{12} \) kg of sugar.

Next, the chef uses \( \frac{13}{23} \) kg of sugar to make a glaze. To find out how much sugar is left, we need to subtract \( \frac{13}{23} \) from \( \frac{343}{12} \).

First, we need a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{343}{12} \) and \( \frac{13}{23} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 23 is 276.

Convert \( \frac{343}{12} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 276:

\[
\frac{343}{12} = \frac{343 \times 23}{12 \times 23} = \frac{7889}{276}
\]

Convert \( \frac{13}{23} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 276:

\[
\frac{13}{23} = \frac{13 \times 12}{23 \times 12} = \frac{156}{276}
\]

Now, subtract \( \frac{156}{276} \) from \( \frac{7889}{276} \):

\[
\frac{7889}{276} - \frac{156}{276} = \frac{7889 - 156}{276} = \frac{7733}{276}
\]

Finally, simplify \( \frac{7733}{276} \) if possible. Since 7733 and 276 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

\[
\frac{24}{24} = 1 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, the chef starts with 28 kg of sugar. After making one cake, the amount of sugar left is:

\[
28 - 1 = 27 \text{ kg}

Next, the chef adds \( \frac{10}{6} \) kg of sugar to their supply. We simplify \( \frac{10}{6} \):

\[
\frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

To add \( 27 \) kg and \( \frac{5}{3} \) kg, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 27 and \( \frac{5}{3} \) is 3. We convert 27 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:

\[
27 = \frac{27 \times 3}{3} = \frac{81}{3}

Now, we add \( \frac{81}{3} \) and \( \frac{5}{3} \):

\[

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much of the pies Princess Lily ate, we need to add the fractions of each pie she consumed.

First, let's calculate the fraction of the apple pie she ate:
\[ \text{Fraction of apple pie eaten} = \frac{10}{12} \]

Next, let's calculate the fraction of the blueberry pie she ate:
\[ \text{Fraction of blueberry pie eaten} = \frac{10}{29} \]

To find the total amount of pie she ate, we need to add these two fractions:
\[ \frac{10}{12} + \frac{10}{29} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 29 is 348. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{10}{12} = \frac{10 \times 29}{12 \times 29} = \frac{290}{348} \]
\[ \frac{10}{29} = \frac{10 \times 12}{29 \times 12} = \frac{120}{348} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{290}{348} + \frac{120}{348} = \frac{290 + 120}{348} = \frac{410}{348} \]

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 410 and 348 is 2:

Next, let's consider the chocolate cake. Since she ate the entire 10-slice chocolate cake, the fraction of the chocolate cake she ate is:

Now, we need to add these two fractions to find the total amount of food she ate:

First, let's break down the expression:

1. Calculate the rate of colored pencils used per day:
   \[
   \frac{20}{11}
   \]

2. Calculate the fraction of colored pencils used for shading:
   \[
   \frac{23}{26}
   \]

3. Multiply these two fractions together:
   \[
   \left(\frac{20}{11}\right) \times \left(\frac{23}{26}\right)
   \]

To multiply the fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
\[
\frac{20 \times 23}{11 \times 26} = \frac{460}{286}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{460}{286}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 460 and 286. The GCD of 460 and 286 is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{460 \div 2}{286 \div 2} = \frac{230}{143}

\frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Next, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{4}{3} + \frac{230}{143}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 143 is 429.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 429:
\[
\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 143}{3 \times 143} = \frac{572}{429}
\]
\[
\frac{230}{143} = \frac{230 \times 3}{143 \times 3} = \frac{690}{429}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{572}{429} + \frac{690}{429} = \frac{572 + 690}{429} = \frac{1262}{429}
\]

Finally, simplify the fraction \(\frac{1262}{429}\). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1262 and 429 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

            Marta realized that she actually only uses 23 out of 24 colored pencils for shading techniques, not 23 out of 26 as previously mentioned. Now, how many colored pencils does Marta use for shading in her art projects over an 11-day period? 

To find this, you need to adjust the previous calculation. Evaluate this by performing the operation (20 / 11) * (23 / 24) and write your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many colored pencils Marta uses for shading in her art projects over an 11-day period with the updated information, we need to evaluate the expression \((20 / 11) * (23 / 24)\).

First, let's break down the expression:

1. Calculate the rate of colored pencils used per day:
   \[
   \frac{20}{11}
   \]

2. Calculate the fraction of colored pencils used for shading:
   \[
   \frac{23}{24}
   \]

3. Multiply these two fractions together:
   \[
   \left(\frac{20}{11}\right) \times \left(\frac{23}{24}\right)
   \]

To multiply the fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
\[
\frac{20 \times 23}{11 \times 24} = \frac{460}{264}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{460}{264}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 460 and 264. The GCD of 460 and 264 is 4.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{460 \div 4}{264 \div 4} = \frac{115}{66}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:
\[
\frac{115}{66}
\]

            A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspectâ€™s involvement. Calculate the value of f.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to calculate the indicators \( i \) and \( h \) and then multiply them to find the final evidence factor \( f \).

First, let's calculate indicator \( i \):

1. The first specimen decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. This can be expressed as a ratio:
   \[
   \frac{26}{6}
   \]

2. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. This can be expressed as a ratio:
   \[
   \frac{25}{17}
   \]

3. The ratio of these changes (indicator \( i \)) is:
   \[
   i = \frac{\frac{26}{6}}{\frac{25}{17}} = \frac{26}{6} \times \frac{17}{25} = \frac{26 \times 17}{6 \times 25} = \frac{442}{150}
   \]

4. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{442}{150} = \frac{221}{75}
   \]

Next, let's calculate indicator \( h \):

1. The first specimen increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units. This can be expressed as a ratio:
   \[
   \frac{18}{8}
   \]

2. The second specimen increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. This can be expressed as a ratio:
   \[
   \frac{17}{23}
   \]

3. The difference between these two rates (indicator \( h \)) is:
   \[
   h = \frac{18}{8} - \frac{17}{23}
   \]

4. To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 23 is 184:
   \[
   \frac{18}{8} = \frac{18 \times 23}{8 \times 23} = \frac{414}{184}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{17}{23} = \frac{17 \times 8}{23 \times 8} = \frac{136}{184}
   \]

5. Subtract the fractions:
   \[
   h = \frac{414}{184} - \frac{136}{184} = \frac{278}{184}
   \]

6. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{278}{184} = \frac{139}{92}
   \]

Finally, we combine these two indicators by multiplying them to get the final evidence factor \( f \):

1. Multiply \( i \) and \( h \):
   \[
   f = \frac{221}{75} \times \frac{139}{92} = \frac{221 \times 139}{75 \times 92} = \frac{30719}{6900}
   \]

2. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{30719}{6900}
   \]

Since 30719 and 6900 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

            In a wildlife park, there are lions and giraffes. During one particular year, the gestation period of a lioness is represented as 20/22 of a year, while a giraffe's gestation period is 15 years. Find the total gestation period of both animals together. 

Later in the same year, a lioness is pregnant again but this time her gestation period reduces by 15/20 of a year compared to the earlier total gestation period of both animals. How long will it take for the lioness to give birth this second time?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's find the total gestation period of both animals together.

1. The gestation period of a lioness is given as \( \frac{20}{22} \) of a year.
2. The gestation period of a giraffe is given as 15 years.

To find the total gestation period, we add these two periods together:
\[ \text{Total gestation period} = \frac{20}{22} + 15 \]

Simplify \( \frac{20}{22} \):
\[ \frac{20}{22} = \frac{10}{11} \]

So, the total gestation period is:
\[ \frac{10}{11} + 15 \]

Next, we need to find the reduced gestation period for the lioness in the second instance. The reduction is given as \( \frac{15}{20} \) of a year.

Simplify \( \frac{15}{20} \):
\[ \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Now, subtract this reduction from the total gestation period of both animals:
\[ \text{Reduced gestation period} = \left( \frac{10}{11} + 15 \right) - \frac{3}{4} \]

First, convert \( 15 \) to a fraction with a common denominator with \( \frac{10}{11} \):
\[ 15 = \frac{165}{11} \]

So, the total gestation period in terms of a common denominator is:
\[ \frac{10}{11} + \frac{165}{11} = \frac{175}{11} \]

Now, convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) to a fraction with a common denominator with \( \frac{175}{11} \):
\[ \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 11}{4 \times 11} = \frac{33}{44} \]

Convert \( \frac{175}{11} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 44:
\[ \frac{175}{11} = \frac{175 \times 4}{11 \times 4} = \frac{700}{44} \]

Subtract \( \frac{33}{44} \) from \( \frac{700}{44} \):
\[ \frac{700}{44} - \frac{33}{44} = \frac{700 - 33}{44} = \frac{667}{44} \]

Simplify \( \frac{667}{44} \):
\[ \frac{667}{44} = 15.159 \]

So, the reduced gestation period for the lioness is approximately 15.159 years.

\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the length is \( \frac{30}{7} \) meters and the width is \( \frac{19}{6} \) meters, we can calculate the area as follows:

\[ A = \frac{30}{7} \times \frac{19}{6} \]

To multiply these fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[ A = \frac{30 \times 19}{7 \times 6} \]

\[ A = \frac{570}{42} \]

We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 570 and 42. The GCD of 570 and 42 is 6. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 6:

\[ A = \frac{570 \div 6}{42 \div 6} \]

\[ A = \frac{95}{7} \]

Now, we need to find the area of the similar rectangle, which is \( \frac{18}{17} \) times bigger than the original rectangle. We multiply the area of the original rectangle by \( \frac{18}{17} \):

\[ \text{Area of similar rectangle} = \frac{95}{7} \times \frac{18}{17} \]

Again, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[ \text{Area of similar rectangle} = \frac{1710}{119} \]

Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 238:

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total production of soap after the adjustments, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Production**: The factory produces \(\frac{23}{8}\) tonnes of soap each day.

2. **Increase in Production**: The factory increases production by \(\frac{4}{20}\) tonnes. Simplify \(\frac{4}{20}\):
   \[
   \frac{4}{20} = \frac{1}{5}
   \]

3. **Total Production after Increase**: Add the increased amount to the initial production:
   \[
   \frac{23}{8} + \frac{1}{5}
   \]

   To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 5 is 40. Convert each fraction:
   \[
   \frac{23}{8} = \frac{23 \times 5}{8 \times 5} = \frac{115}{40}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1 \times 8}{5 \times 8} = \frac{8}{40}
   \]

   Now add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{115}{40} + \frac{8}{40} = \frac{123}{40}
   \]

4. **Reduction in Production**: The factory reduces production by \(\frac{19}{24}\) tonnes. Convert \(\frac{123}{40}\) and \(\frac{19}{24}\) to a common denominator. The least common multiple of 40 and 24 is 120. Convert each fraction:
   \[
   \frac{123}{40} = \frac{123 \times 3}{40 \times 3} = \frac{369}{120}

   \[

   \frac{369}{120} - \frac{95}{120} = \frac{274}{120}
   \]

5. **Simplify the Result**: Simplify \(\frac{274}{120}\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 274 and 120, which is 2:
   \[
   \frac{274 \div 2}{120 \div 2} = \frac{137}{60}
   \]

Thus, the factory produces \(\frac{137}{60}\) tonnes of soap that day after the adjustments.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the same soap factory, consider a new scenario where instead of reducing production by 19/24 of a tonne due to a power cut, they only reduce production by 8/24 of a tonne. Following the same adjustment of increasing production by an extra 4/20 of a tonne earlier in the day, how many tonnes of soap does the factory produce that day?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total production of soap after the new adjustments, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Production**: The factory produces \(\frac{23}{8}\) tonnes of soap each day.

2. **Increase in Production**: The factory increases production by \(\frac{4}{20}\) tonnes. Simplify \(\frac{4}{20}\):
   \[
   \frac{4}{20} = \frac{1}{5}
   \]

3. **Total Production after Increase**: Add the increased amount to the initial production:
   \[
   \frac{23}{8} + \frac{1}{5}
   \]

   To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 5 is 40. Convert each fraction:
   \[
   \frac{23}{8} = \frac{23 \times 5}{8 \times 5} = \frac{115}{40}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1 \times 8}{5 \times 8} = \frac{8}{40}
   \]

   Now add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{115}{40} + \frac{8}{40} = \frac{123}{40}
   \]

4. **Reduction in Production**: The factory reduces production by \(\frac{8}{24}\) tonnes. Simplify \(\frac{8}{24}\):
   \[
   \frac{8}{24} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

   Convert \(\frac{123}{40}\) and \(\frac{1}{3}\) to a common denominator. The least common multiple of 40 and 3 is 120. Convert each fraction:
   \[
   \frac{123}{40} = \frac{123 \times 3}{40 \times 3} = \frac{369}{120}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 40}{3 \times 40} = \frac{40}{120}
   \]

   Now subtract the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{369}{120} - \frac{40}{120} = \frac{329}{120}
   \]

5. **Simplify the Result**: Simplify \(\frac{329}{120}\) if possible. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 329 and 120 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the factory produces \(\frac{329}{120}\) tonnes of soap that day after the adjustments.

            You have a paint mixing machine that creates specific shades of color.

The machine starts by mixing 24/8 gallons of red paint. It then pours away 12/8 gallons of the mix. Let 'd' represent the amount of red paint left in the machine.

Finally, the machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color, subtract that from 'd' to find 'x' in gallons, which is the total amount of paint. Find the value of 'x'.

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the initial amount of red paint mixed by the machine:
\[ \frac{24}{8} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, the machine pours away:
\[ \frac{12}{8} = 1.5 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of red paint left in the machine, \( d \), is:
\[ d = 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 \text{ gallons} \]

The machine then adds \( \frac{1}{28} \) gallon of blue pigment. The total amount of paint, \( x \), is:
\[ x = d + \frac{1}{28} \]
\[ x = 1.5 + \frac{1}{28} \]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1.5 (which is \( \frac{3}{2} \)) and \( \frac{1}{28} \) is 28:
\[ 1.5 = \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3 \times 14}{2 \times 14} = \frac{42}{28} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ x = \frac{42}{28} + \frac{1}{28} = \frac{42 + 1}{28} = \frac{43}{28} \]

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the product of the fractions \(\frac{27}{14}\) and \(\frac{17}{13}\), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{27}{14} \times \frac{17}{13} = \frac{27 \times 17}{14 \times 13}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
27 \times 17 = 459
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
14 \times 13 = 182
\]

So, the product of the fractions is:

\[
\frac{459}{182}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 459 and 182. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 459 by 182 and find the remainder:
\[
459 \div 182 \approx 2.52 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
459 - 2 \times 182 = 459 - 364 = 95
\]

2. Now, divide 182 by 95 and find the remainder:
\[
182 \div 95 \approx 1.91 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
182 - 1 \times 95 = 182 - 95 = 87
\]

3. Next, divide 95 by 87 and find the remainder:
\[
95 \div 87 \approx 1.09 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
95 - 1 \times 87 = 95 - 87 = 8
\]

4. Finally, divide 87 by 8 and find the remainder:
\[
87 \div 8 \approx 10.875 \quad \text{(integer part is 10)}
\]
\[
87 - 10 \times 8 = 87 - 80 = 7
\]

5. Divide 8 by 7 and find the remainder:
\[
8 \div 7 \approx 1.14 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
8 - 1 \times 7 = 8 - 7 = 1
\]

Since the remainder is now 1, the GCD of 459 and 182 is 1. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{459}{182}\) is already in its simplest form.

            After finding out how many ounces of mashed bananas you'll need for the banana bread, you realize that you need to scale up the recipe by the factor represented by the fraction (8 / 4). Compute the product of the original fraction and the scaling factor (8 / 4) to determine the new amount of mashed bananas that will be needed. Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the new amount of mashed bananas needed, we need to multiply the original fraction \(\frac{459}{182}\) by the scaling factor \(\frac{8}{4}\).

First, simplify the scaling factor \(\frac{8}{4}\):

\[
\frac{8}{4} = 2
\]

Now, multiply the original fraction by 2:

\[
\frac{459}{182} \times 2 = \frac{459 \times 2}{182}
\]

Calculate the numerator:

\[
459 \times 2 = 918
\]

So, the new fraction is:

\[
\frac{918}{182}
\]

Next, we simplify this fraction. We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 918 and 182. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 918 by 182 and find the remainder:
\[
918 \div 182 \approx 5.04 \quad \text{(integer part is 5)}
\]
\[
918 - 5 \times 182 = 918 - 910 = 8
\]

2. Now, divide 182 by 8 and find the remainder:
\[
182 \div 8 \approx 22.75 \quad \text{(integer part is 22)}
\]
\[
182 - 22 \times 8 = 182 - 176 = 6
\]

3. Next, divide 8 by 6 and find the remainder:
\[
8 \div 6 \approx 1.33 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
8 - 1 \times 6 = 8 - 6 = 2
\]

4. Finally, divide 6 by 2 and find the remainder:
\[
6 \div 2 = 3 \quad \text{(integer part is 3)}
\]
\[
6 - 3 \times 2 = 6 - 6 = 0
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD of 918 and 182 is 2. Therefore, we can simplify the fraction \(\frac{918}{182}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[
\frac{918 \div 2}{182 \div 2} = \frac{459}{91}
\]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the product of the fractions \(\frac{27}{14}\) and \(\frac{17}{15}\), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{27}{14} \times \frac{17}{15} = \frac{27 \times 17}{14 \times 15}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
27 \times 17 = 459
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
14 \times 15 = 210
\]

So, the product of the fractions is:

\[
\frac{459}{210}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 459 and 210. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 459 by 210 and find the remainder:
\[
459 \div 210 \approx 2.19 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
459 - 2 \times 210 = 459 - 420 = 39
\]

2. Now, divide 210 by 39 and find the remainder:
\[
210 \div 39 \approx 5.38 \quad \text{(integer part is 5)}
\]
\[
210 - 5 \times 39 = 210 - 195 = 15
\]

3. Next, divide 39 by 15 and find the remainder:
\[
39 \div 15 \approx 2.6 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
39 - 2 \times 15 = 39 - 30 = 9
\]

4. Finally, divide 15 by 9 and find the remainder:
\[
15 \div 9 \approx 1.67 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
15 - 1 \times 9 = 15 - 9 = 6
\]

5. Divide 9 by 6 and find the remainder:
\[
9 \div 6 \approx 1.5 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
9 - 1 \times 6 = 9 - 6 = 3
\]

6. Divide 6 by 3 and find the remainder:
\[
6 \div 3 = 2 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
6 - 2 \times 3 = 6 - 6 = 0
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD of 459 and 210 is 3. Therefore, we can simplify the fraction \(\frac{459}{210}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 3:

\[
\frac{459 \div 3}{210 \div 3} = \frac{153}{70}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's add the quantities of toothpaste used by Sonia and Anthony.

Sonia uses \( \frac{21}{12} \) oz of toothpaste daily.
Anthony uses \( \frac{6}{27} \) oz of toothpaste daily.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 27 is 108.

Convert \( \frac{21}{12} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 108:
\[ \frac{21}{12} = \frac{21 \times 9}{12 \times 9} = \frac{189}{108} \]

Convert \( \frac{6}{27} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 108:
\[ \frac{6}{27} = \frac{6 \times 4}{27 \times 4} = \frac{24}{108} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{189}{108} + \frac{24}{108} = \frac{189 + 24}{108} = \frac{213}{108} \]

Next, simplify \( \frac{213}{108} \):
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 213 and 108 is 3.
\[ \frac{213 \div 3}{108 \div 3} = \frac{71}{36} \]

Now, let's add the amount of toothpaste used by their mom, which is \( \frac{3}{18} \).

Convert \( \frac{3}{18} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 36:
\[ \frac{3}{18} = \frac{3 \times 2}{18 \times 2} = \frac{6}{36} \]

Now, add this to the previous total:
\[ \frac{71}{36} + \frac{6}{36} = \frac{71 + 6}{36} = \frac{77}{36} \]

Finally, simplify \( \frac{77}{36} \):
The GCD of 77 and 36 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously calculated the total daily toothpaste usage for Sonia, Anthony, and their mom as \( \frac{77}{36} \).

Now, we need to add grandma's daily usage of \( \frac{24}{28} \) oz.

First, simplify \( \frac{24}{28} \):
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 24 and 28 is 4.
\[ \frac{24 \div 4}{28 \div 4} = \frac{6}{7} \]

Next, we need a common denominator to add \( \frac{77}{36} \) and \( \frac{6}{7} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 36 and 7 is 252.

Convert \( \frac{77}{36} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 252:
\[ \frac{77}{36} = \frac{77 \times 7}{36 \times 7} = \frac{539}{252} \]

Convert \( \frac{6}{7} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 252:
\[ \frac{6}{7} = \frac{6 \times 36}{7 \times 36} = \frac{216}{252} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{539}{252} + \frac{216}{252} = \frac{539 + 216}{252} = \frac{755}{252} \]

            In our ongoing toothpaste saga, consider the situation where Sonia is still using 21/12 oz of toothpaste to brush her teeth daily but Anthony decides to use more toothpaste and now uses 26/27 oz daily instead. Their mom's daily toothpaste usage remains at 3/18 oz. 

Calculate the new total daily toothpaste usage for Sonia, Anthony, and their mom. Give your answer as a simplified fraction.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's add the quantities of toothpaste used by Sonia and Anthony.

Sonia uses \( \frac{21}{12} \) oz of toothpaste daily.
Anthony now uses \( \frac{26}{27} \) oz of toothpaste daily.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 27 is 108.

Convert \( \frac{21}{12} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 108:
\[ \frac{21}{12} = \frac{21 \times 9}{12 \times 9} = \frac{189}{108} \]

Convert \( \frac{26}{27} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 108:
\[ \frac{26}{27} = \frac{26 \times 4}{27 \times 4} = \frac{104}{108} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{189}{108} + \frac{104}{108} = \frac{189 + 104}{108} = \frac{293}{108} \]

Next, let's add the amount of toothpaste used by their mom, which is \( \frac{3}{18} \).

Convert \( \frac{3}{18} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 108:
\[ \frac{3}{18} = \frac{3 \times 6}{18 \times 6} = \frac{18}{108} \]

Now, add this to the previous total:
\[ \frac{293}{108} + \frac{18}{108} = \frac{293 + 18}{108} = \frac{311}{108} \]

Finally, simplify \( \frac{311}{108} \):
The GCD of 311 and 108 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

            Let's suppose for a special recipe sandwich, you need to divide a wheel of cheese into 14 equal parts and a pickle jar into 18 equal parts. 

To make one special sandwich, you need 21 parts of the wheel of cheese and 7 parts from the pickle jar.

You've just made these sandwiches and you are down to ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of your original ingredients.

Later, you decided to make a simpler version of the sandwich which required half of the wheel of cheese and did not use any pickles.

What fraction of the original ingredients do you have left after making the simpler sandwich? Calculate the answer by subtracting (2 / 4) from the fraction you had after making the first sandwich.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the fraction of the original ingredients left after making the special sandwiches.
2. Subtract the fraction used for the simpler sandwich from the remaining fraction.

First, let's calculate the fraction of the original ingredients left after making the special sandwiches:

Given:
- The fraction of the wheel of cheese left is \(\frac{21}{14}\).
- The fraction of the pickle jar left is \(\frac{7}{18}\).

We need to add these fractions together:
\[
\frac{21}{14} + \frac{7}{18}
\]

First, simplify \(\frac{21}{14}\):
\[
\frac{21}{14} = \frac{21 \div 7}{14 \div 7} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Now, add \(\frac{3}{2}\) and \(\frac{7}{18}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 18 is 18.

Convert \(\frac{3}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 18:
\[
\frac{3}{2} = \frac{3 \times 9}{2 \times 9} = \frac{27}{18}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{27}{18} + \frac{7}{18} = \frac{27 + 7}{18} = \frac{34}{18}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{34}{18}\):
\[
\frac{34}{18} = \frac{34 \div 2}{18 \div 2} = \frac{17}{9}
\]

Next, we need to subtract the fraction used for the simpler sandwich. The simpler sandwich uses half of the wheel of cheese, which is \(\frac{1}{2}\) or \(\frac{2}{4}\).

Convert \(\frac{2}{4}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
\[
\frac{2}{4} = \frac{2 \times 9}{4 \times 9} = \frac{18}{36} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Now, subtract \(\frac{1}{2}\) from \(\frac{17}{9}\). Convert \(\frac{1}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 9}{2 \times 9} = \frac{9}{18}
\]

Subtract:
\[
\frac{17}{9} - \frac{9}{18}
\]

Convert \(\frac{9}{18}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
\[
\frac{9}{18} = \frac{9 \div 9}{18 \div 9} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{9}{18}
\]

Now, subtract:
\[
\frac{17}{9} - \frac{9}{18} = \frac{34}{18} - \frac{9}{18} = \frac{34 - 9}{18} = \frac{25}{18}
\]

            In the same scenario, let's say you found a jar of pickles in the back of your fridge, so now you have 19 parts of the pickle jar instead of the 7 you thought you had.

So, for the initial special recipe sandwiches, you now have ((19 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of your original ingredients.

Just like before, later, you decided to make a simpler version of the sandwich that required half of the wheel of cheese and didn't use any pickles.

What fraction of the original ingredients do you now have left after making the simpler sandwich? Calculate the answer by subtracting (2 / 4) from the fraction you had after making the first special recipe sandwiches with the extra pickles.

Given:
- The fraction of the wheel of cheese left is \(\frac{21}{14}\).
- The fraction of the pickle jar left is \(\frac{19}{18}\).

We need to add these fractions together:
\[
\frac{21}{14} + \frac{19}{18}
\]

First, simplify \(\frac{21}{14}\):
\[
\frac{21}{14} = \frac{21 \div 7}{14 \div 7} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Now, add \(\frac{3}{2}\) and \(\frac{19}{18}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 18 is 18.

Convert \(\frac{3}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 18:

\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{27}{18} + \frac{19}{18} = \frac{27 + 19}{18} = \frac{46}{18}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{46}{18}\):
\[
\frac{46}{18} = \frac{46 \div 2}{18 \div 2} = \frac{23}{9}
\]

Next, we need to subtract the fraction used for the simpler sandwich. The simpler sandwich uses half of the wheel of cheese, which is \(\frac{1}{2}\) or \(\frac{2}{4}\).

Convert \(\frac{2}{4}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
\[
\frac{2}{4} = \frac{2 \times 9}{4 \times 9} = \frac{18}{36} = \frac{1}{2}

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 9}{2 \times 9} = \frac{9}{18}
\]

Subtract:
\[
\frac{23}{9} - \frac{9}{18}
\]

Convert \(\frac{9}{18}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
\[
\frac{9}{18} = \frac{9 \div 9}{18 \div 9} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{9}{18}
\]

Now, subtract:
\[
\frac{23}{9} - \frac{9}{18} = \frac{46}{18} - \frac{9}{18} = \frac{46 - 9}{18} = \frac{37}{18}

First, let's simplify the fraction \( \frac{15}{6} \):
\[ \frac{15}{6} = \frac{15 \div 3}{6 \div 3} = \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, we need to add \( \frac{5}{2} \) and \( \frac{7}{16} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 16 is 16.

Convert \( \frac{5}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 16:
\[ \frac{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 8}{2 \times 8} = \frac{40}{16} \]

Now, add \( \frac{40}{16} \) and \( \frac{7}{16} \):
\[ \frac{40}{16} + \frac{7}{16} = \frac{40 + 7}{16} = \frac{47}{16} \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{20}{12} \):

Now, we add the simplified fractions together along with the cranberry juice:

1. Time spent cycling:
\[ \frac{18}{8} \text{ hours} = 2.25 \text{ hours} \]

2. Time spent conducting scientific experiments (adjusted):
\[ \frac{11}{2} \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours} \]

3. Time spent reviewing data:
\[ \frac{30}{8} \text{ hours} = 3.75 \text{ hours} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much cheese Jeremy actually received, we start with the total weight of cheese he ordered, which is \( \frac{30}{9} \) ounces. We need to subtract the amount of cheese that was missing, which is \( \frac{17}{22} \) ounces.

First, simplify \( \frac{30}{9} \):
\[ \frac{30}{9} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{17}{22} \) from \( \frac{10}{3} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 22 is 66.

Convert \( \frac{10}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 66:
\[ \frac{10}{3} = \frac{10 \times 22}{3 \times 22} = \frac{220}{66} \]

Convert \( \frac{17}{22} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 66:
\[ \frac{17}{22} = \frac{17 \times 3}{22 \times 3} = \frac{51}{66} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{220}{66} - \frac{51}{66} = \frac{220 - 51}{66} = \frac{169}{66} \]

Thus, Jeremy actually received \( \frac{169}{66} \) ounces of cheese.

We need to subtract the new amount of cheese that was missing, which is \( \frac{20}{22} \) ounces.

First, simplify \( \frac{30}{9} \):

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{20}{22} \) from \( \frac{10}{3} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 22 is 66.

Now, subtract the two fractions:

            Sophia is a researcher who studies sunglasses. She was examining a batch of sunglasses and trying to calculate the average light blocking efficiency.

In the first test, she found that 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays completely, while in the second test, 20 out of every 18 sunglasses also blocked all UV rays.

Sophia decided to add these numbers to her total. Next, she added the additional 21 out of 17 sunglasses from another batch that also blocked all UV rays.

Later, she realized she made a mistake and needed to subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that actually did not block all UV rays.

What is the final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays, according to Sophia's tests and calculations? Please give your answer as a simplified fraction.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add and subtract the fractions representing the sunglasses that blocked all UV rays and those that did not.

First, let's convert all the given fractions to a common denominator to make the calculations easier.

1. The first test result is \( \frac{13}{4} \).
2. The second test result is \( \frac{20}{18} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{10}{9} \).
3. The additional batch result is \( \frac{21}{17} \).
4. The incorrect batch result is \( \frac{16}{30} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{8}{15} \).

Now, we need to find a common denominator for these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4, 9, 17, and 15 is 3060.

Let's convert each fraction to have the denominator 3060:

1. \( \frac{13}{4} = \frac{13 \times 765}{4 \times 765} = \frac{9945}{3060} \)
2. \( \frac{10}{9} = \frac{10 \times 340}{9 \times 340} = \frac{3400}{3060} \)
3. \( \frac{21}{17} = \frac{21 \times 180}{17 \times 180} = \frac{3780}{3060} \)
4. \( \frac{8}{15} = \frac{8 \times 204}{15 \times 204} = \frac{1632}{3060} \)

Now, we add the fractions that represent sunglasses blocking all UV rays and subtract the fraction that represents sunglasses not blocking all UV rays:

\[
\frac{9945}{3060} + \frac{3400}{3060} + \frac{3780}{3060} - \frac{1632}{3060}
\]

Combine the numerators:

\[
9945 + 3400 + 3780 - 1632 = 15493
\]

So, the combined fraction is:

\[
\frac{15493}{3060}

This fraction is already in its simplest form because 15493 and 3060 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to multiply the fraction representing the final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays by the fraction representing the pairs of sunglasses subjected to the special UV light test.

The final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is represented by the fraction \(\frac{15493}{3060}\).

The fraction of pairs of sunglasses subjected to the special UV light test is \(\frac{13}{6}\).

We need to multiply these two fractions:

\[
\frac{15493}{3060} \times \frac{13}{6}
\]

First, multiply the numerators and the denominators:

\[
\frac{15493 \times 13}{3060 \times 6} = \frac{201409}{18360}
\]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 201409 and 18360. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(201409 \div 18360 \approx 10\) with a remainder of \(201409 - 183600 = 17809\)
2. \(18360 \div 17809 \approx 1\) with a remainder of \(18360 - 17809 = 551\)
3. \(17809 \div 551 \approx 32\) with a remainder of \(17809 - 17632 = 177\)
4. \(551 \div 177 \approx 3\) with a remainder of \(551 - 531 = 20\)
5. \(177 \div 20 \approx 8\) with a remainder of \(177 - 160 = 17\)
6. \(20 \div 17 \approx 1\) with a remainder of \(20 - 17 = 3\)
7. \(17 \div 3 \approx 5\) with a remainder of \(17 - 15 = 2\)
8. \(3 \div 2 \approx 1\) with a remainder of \(3 - 2 = 1\)
9. \(2 \div 1 \approx 2\) with a remainder of \(2 - 2 = 0\)

The GCD is 1, so the fraction \(\frac{201409}{18360}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To correct the calculations, we need to update the fraction for the first test and then proceed with the same operations as before.

1. The corrected first test result is \( \frac{13}{28} \).
2. The second test result remains \( \frac{20}{18} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{10}{9} \).
3. The additional batch result remains \( \frac{21}{17} \).
4. The incorrect batch result remains \( \frac{16}{30} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{8}{15} \).

We need to find a common denominator for these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 28, 9, 17, and 15 is 21420.

Let's convert each fraction to have the denominator 21420:

1. \( \frac{13}{28} = \frac{13 \times 765}{28 \times 765} = \frac{9945}{21420} \)
2. \( \frac{10}{9} = \frac{10 \times 2380}{9 \times 2380} = \frac{23800}{21420} \)
3. \( \frac{21}{17} = \frac{21 \times 1260}{17 \times 1260} = \frac{26460}{21420} \)
4. \( \frac{8}{15} = \frac{8 \times 1428}{15 \times 1428} = \frac{11424}{21420} \)

Now, we add the fractions that represent sunglasses blocking all UV rays and subtract the fraction that represents sunglasses not blocking all UV rays:

\[
\frac{9945}{21420} + \frac{23800}{21420} + \frac{26460}{21420} - \frac{11424}{21420}

Combine the numerators:

\[
9945 + 23800 + 26460 - 11424 = 48781

So, the combined fraction is:

\frac{48781}{21420}

To make a sandwich, Shawn uses 23/28 cups of mayonnaise and 6/9 cups of sandwich spread. How many cups of these two ingredients does Shawn use in total to make a sandwich?

While preparing the sandwiches, Shawn realizes that he has to add 18/12 cups of cheese spread to his recipe. Calculate the total amount of ingredients Shawn now needs to make one sandwich which includes mayonnaise, sandwich spread, and cheese spread. 

Finally, if Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, how many cups of ingredients will he use in total to make those sandwiches?
        </p>

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's find the total amount of mayonnaise and sandwich spread Shawn uses for one sandwich.

1. **Mayonnaise:**
   \[
   \frac{23}{28} \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Sandwich spread:**
   \[
   \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ cups}
   \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 28 and 3 is 84.

Convert \(\frac{23}{28}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 84:
\[
\frac{23}{28} = \frac{23 \times 3}{28 \times 3} = \frac{69}{84}
\]

Convert \(\frac{2}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 84:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 28}{3 \times 28} = \frac{56}{84}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{69}{84} + \frac{56}{84} = \frac{69 + 56}{84} = \frac{125}{84}
\]

So, the total amount of mayonnaise and sandwich spread is:
\[
\frac{125}{84} \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we add the cheese spread:
\[
\frac{18}{12} = \frac{3 \times 6}{2 \times 6} = \frac{3}{2} = \frac{126}{84}
\]

Now, add this to the previous total:
\[
\frac{125}{84} + \frac{126}{84} = \frac{125 + 126}{84} = \frac{251}{84}
\]

So, the total amount of ingredients for one sandwich is:
\[
\frac{251}{84} \text{ cups}
\]

Finally, if Shawn uses 4/4 cups of all ingredients combined to make an equal number of sandwiches, we need to determine how many sandwiches he can make with \(\frac{4}{4} = 1\) cup of ingredients.

To find the number of sandwiches:
\[
\frac{1}{\frac{251}{84}} = \frac{84}{251}
\]

Thus, the total amount of ingredients used to make these sandwiches is:
\[
\frac{84}{251} \times 1 = \frac{84}{251} \text{ cups}
\]

First, we need a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The least common multiple of 6 and 21 is 42.

Convert \( \frac{7}{6} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 42:
\[ \frac{7}{6} = \frac{7 \times 7}{6 \times 7} = \frac{49}{42} \]

Convert \( \frac{1}{21} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 42:
\[ \frac{1}{21} = \frac{1 \times 2}{21 \times 2} = \frac{2}{42} \]

Now, subtract \( \frac{2}{42} \) from \( \frac{49}{42} \):
\[ \frac{49}{42} - \frac{2}{42} = \frac{49 - 2}{42} = \frac{47}{42} \]

So, Cassandra now has \( \frac{47}{42} \) of a key set.

            Let's consider a slight variation. Instead, Cassandra started her key-hobby with a collection that equaled 23/6 of a key set. After losing 1/21 of a key set, just as before, how many key sets remains in her collection now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many key sets Cassandra has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of key sets Cassandra had, which is \( \frac{23}{6} \) of a key set.
2. Subtract the number of key sets she lost, which is \( \frac{1}{21} \) of a key set.

First, we need a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The least common multiple of 6 and 21 is 42.

Convert \( \frac{23}{6} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 42:
\[ \frac{23}{6} = \frac{23 \times 7}{6 \times 7} = \frac{161}{42} \]

Convert \( \frac{1}{21} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 42:
\[ \frac{1}{21} = \frac{1 \times 2}{21 \times 2} = \frac{2}{42} \]

Now, subtract \( \frac{2}{42} \) from \( \frac{161}{42} \):
\[ \frac{161}{42} - \frac{2}{42} = \frac{161 - 2}{42} = \frac{159}{42} \]

So, Cassandra now has \( \frac{159}{42} \) of a key set. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
\[ \frac{159}{42} = \frac{159 \div 3}{42 \div 3} = \frac{53}{14} \]

            A songwriter is composing a new piece. In the first section, he uses a ratio of 29 notes every 23 measures. In the second section, he uses a ratio of 19 notes every 17 measures.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of the ratios of the two sections and then find the difference between this sum and the ratio of a rest used in the third section.

First, let's calculate the sum of the ratios of the two sections:

1. The ratio of notes to measures in the first section is \( \frac{29}{23} \).
2. The ratio of notes to measures in the second section is \( \frac{19}{17} \).

We add these two ratios together:

\[
\frac{29}{23} + \frac{19}{17}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 23 and 17 is 391 (since 23 and 17 are both prime numbers, their LCM is their product).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 391:

\[
\frac{29}{23} = \frac{29 \times 17}{23 \times 17} = \frac{493}{391}
\]

\[
\frac{19}{17} = \frac{19 \times 23}{17 \times 23} = \frac{437}{391}
\]

Now, add the fractions:

\[
\frac{493}{391} + \frac{437}{391} = \frac{493 + 437}{391} = \frac{930}{391}
\]

Next, we need to find the difference between this sum and the ratio of a rest, which is \( \frac{26}{26} \) (equivalent to 1):

\[
\frac{930}{391} - \frac{26}{26}
\]

Since \( \frac{26}{26} = 1 \), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\frac{930}{391} - 1
\]

Convert 1 to a fraction with the same denominator:

\[
1 = \frac{391}{391}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{930}{391} - \frac{391}{391} = \frac{930 - 391}{391} = \frac{539}{391}
\]

Thus, the difference between the sum of the ratios of the two sections and the ratio of a rest used in the third section is:

            In the same song composition, the songwriter decided to revise the second section. Instead of having a ratio of 19 notes every 17 measures, he decided to keep it consistent with the first section and have a ratio of 19 notes every 23 measures just like in the first section.

Calculate the difference between the sum of the ratios of the two sections ((29 / 23) + (19 / 23)) and the ratio of a rest, which is equivalent to one whole measure (26/26), used in the third section of his composition after this change.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of the revised ratios of the two sections and then find the difference between this sum and the ratio of a rest used in the third section.

First, let's calculate the sum of the revised ratios of the two sections:

1. The ratio of notes to measures in the first section is \( \frac{29}{23} \).
2. The revised ratio of notes to measures in the second section is \( \frac{19}{23} \).

We add these two ratios together:

\[
\frac{29}{23} + \frac{19}{23}
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can directly add the numerators:

\[
\frac{29 + 19}{23} = \frac{48}{23}
\]

Next, we need to find the difference between this sum and the ratio of a rest, which is \( \frac{26}{26} \) (equivalent to 1):

\[
\frac{48}{23} - \frac{26}{26}
\]

Since \( \frac{26}{26} = 1 \), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\frac{48}{23} - 1
\]

Convert 1 to a fraction with the same denominator:

\[
1 = \frac{23}{23}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{48}{23} - \frac{23}{23} = \frac{48 - 23}{23} = \frac{25}{23}
\]

Thus, the difference between the sum of the revised ratios of the two sections and the ratio of a rest used in the third section is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the product of the fractions \( \frac{22}{25} \) and \( \frac{22}{8} \), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

Next, multiply the denominators:
\[ 25 \times 8 = 200 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{484}{200} \]

To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 484 and 200. The GCD of 484 and 200 is 4.

Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

The denominators are 50 and 13. The least common multiple (LCM) of 50 and 13 is 650.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 650.

For \(\frac{121}{50}\):
\[ \frac{121}{50} = \frac{121 \times 13}{50 \times 13} = \frac{1573}{650} \]

For \(\frac{23}{13}\):
\[ \frac{23}{13} = \frac{23 \times 50}{13 \times 50} = \frac{1150}{650} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{1573}{650} + \frac{1150}{650} = \frac{1573 + 1150}{650} = \frac{2723}{650} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the additional distance the car was supposed to travel. The car was supposed to travel an extra \( \frac{16}{13} \) miles, but it only traveled an additional \( \frac{1}{21} \) miles. 

To find the difference, we need to subtract \( \frac{1}{21} \) from \( \frac{16}{13} \):

\[
\frac{16}{13} - \frac{1}{21}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 21 is 273. We convert each fraction:

\[
\frac{16}{13} = \frac{16 \times 21}{13 \times 21} = \frac{336}{273}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{21} = \frac{1 \times 13}{21 \times 13} = \frac{13}{273}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{336}{273} - \frac{13}{273} = \frac{336 - 13}{273} = \frac{323}{273}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how many more miles the car was supposed to travel in total that day. The car travels \( \frac{21}{4} \) miles every hour. We multiply this speed by the additional distance:

\[
\frac{21}{4} \times \frac{323}{273}
\]

First, simplify the multiplication:

\[
\frac{21 \times 323}{4 \times 273}
\]

Calculate the numerator and the denominator:

\[
21 \times 323 = 6783
\]

\[
4 \times 273 = 1092
\]

So, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{6783}{1092}
\]

Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6783 and 1092. The GCD is 21:

\[
\frac{6783 \div 21}{1092 \div 21} = \frac{323}{52}
\]

Thus, the car was supposed to travel an additional \( \frac{323}{52} \) miles.

            Continuing from the original scenario, instead of an extra 16/13 miles, suppose the car was actually supposed to travel an additional 16/6 miles, but still it only traveled an additional 1/21 miles due to the detour. How many more miles was the car supposed to travel in total that day, given that it ran continuously at the same speed?

\[
\frac{16}{6} - \frac{1}{21}
\]

First, simplify \( \frac{16}{6} \):

\[
\frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

Now, we need a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The least common multiple of 3 and 21 is 21. We convert each fraction:

\[
\frac{8}{3} = \frac{8 \times 7}{3 \times 7} = \frac{56}{21}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{21} = \frac{1}{21}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{56}{21} - \frac{1}{21} = \frac{56 - 1}{21} = \frac{55}{21}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how many more miles the car was supposed to travel in total that day. The car travels \( \frac{21}{4} \) miles every hour. We multiply this speed by the additional distance:

\[
\frac{21}{4} \times \frac{55}{21}
\]

First, simplify the multiplication:

\[
\frac{21 \times 55}{4 \times 21}
\]

The 21s cancel out:

\[
\frac{55}{4}
\]

Thus, the car was supposed to travel an additional \( \frac{55}{4} \) miles.

            In a book publishing company, the manager has to look after various departments. The editing team takes 20/5 hours to edit a manuscript of a book, while the typesetting team needs 18/17 hours to adjust the layout of a page. 

Some break delay happens that results in a collective loss of 6/15 hours. 

After these delays and losses, the manager, to compensate, extended the working hours by the same amount of time as the initial time span of the process. 

On a particular day, they continue to work. What's the total extended time in hours, if you multiply the time required for the entire process and the extended time after the reduction of the lost hours with the initial total time required?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time taken by the editing team to edit a manuscript.
2. Calculate the time taken by the typesetting team to adjust the layout of a page.
3. Sum these times to get the initial total time required for the process.
4. Subtract the collective loss due to breaks.
5. Determine the extended time, which is equal to the initial total time required.
6. Multiply the initial total time required by the extended time after the reduction of the lost hours.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. **Time taken by the editing team:**
   \[
   \text{Time taken by the editing team} = \frac{20}{5} \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Time taken by the typesetting team:**
   \[
   \text{Time taken by the typesetting team} = \frac{18}{17} \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Initial total time required:**
   \[
   \text{Initial total time required} = 4 \text{ hours} + \frac{18}{17} \text{ hours}
   \]
   To add these times, we need a common denominator:
   \[
   4 = \frac{68}{17}
   \]
   So,
   \[
   \text{Initial total time required} = \frac{68}{17} + \frac{18}{17} = \frac{86}{17} \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Subtract the collective loss due to breaks:**
   \[
   \text{Collective loss} = \frac{6}{15} \text{ hours} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ hours}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the initial total time:
   \[
   \text{Adjusted time} = \frac{86}{17} - \frac{2}{5}
   \]
   To subtract these, we need a common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{86}{17} = \frac{86 \times 5}{17 \times 5} = \frac{430}{85}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 17}{5 \times 17} = \frac{34}{85}
   \]
   So,
   \[
   \text{Adjusted time} = \frac{430}{85} - \frac{34}{85} = \frac{396}{85} \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Extended time (equal to the initial total time required):**
   \[
   \text{Extended time} = \frac{86}{17} \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Multiply the initial total time required by the extended time after the reduction of the lost hours:**
   \[
   \text{Total extended time} = \left(\frac{86}{17}\right) \times \left(\frac{396}{85}\right)
   \]
   Simplify the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{86}{17} = 5.058823529
   \]
   \[
   \frac{396}{85} = 4.658823529
   \]
   \[
   5.058823529 \times 4.658823529 = 23.56

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much Jenny will make in total by selling all her potatoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bushels Jenny yields.
2. Calculate the total earnings from selling the bushels.

First, let's find the total number of bushels Jenny yields:

Jenny plants \( \frac{13}{11} \) rows, and each row yields \( \frac{21}{3} \) bushels.

\[
\text{Total bushels} = \frac{13}{11} \times \frac{21}{3}
\]

Simplify \( \frac{21}{3} \):

\[
\frac{21}{3} = 7
\]

Now, multiply:

\[
\frac{13}{11} \times 7 = \frac{13 \times 7}{11} = \frac{91}{11} = 8.2727 \text{ (approximately)}
\]

Next, calculate the total earnings from selling the bushels:

Each bushel earns \( \frac{21}{15} \) dollars.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \frac{91}{11} \times \frac{21}{15}
\]

Simplify \( \frac{21}{15} \):

\[
\frac{21}{15} = \frac{7}{5}
\]

Now, multiply:

\[
\frac{91}{11} \times \frac{7}{5} = \frac{91 \times 7}{11 \times 5} = \frac{637}{55}
\]

Simplify \( \frac{637}{55} \):

\[
\frac{637}{55} \approx 11.5818 \text{ (approximately)}
\]

Thus, Jenny will make approximately 11.5818 dollars by selling all her potatoes.

For the gold:
\[ \frac{14}{28} = \frac{14 \div 14}{28 \div 14} = \frac{1}{2} \]

For the silver:
\[ \frac{13}{26} = \frac{13 \div 13}{26 \div 13} = \frac{1}{2} \]

We already know the amount of silver used is:

\[ \frac{13}{26} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, we need to add these two fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 4 and 2 is 4.

Convert \(\frac{1}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:

\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 2}{2 \times 2} = \frac{2}{4} \]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[ \frac{3}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3 + 2}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \]

            In a beehive, there are sections for honey storage and bee rearing. Each section is classified into many sub-sections. One day, the beekeeper discovered that each honey storage sub-section had (25 / 9) gallons of honey. He also found the same amount of honey in each bee rearing sub-section. 

If he combined the honey from both a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the beekeeper would have a total quantity represented by 'p'. 

However, one honey storage sub-section had an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey. So, if the beekeeper was calculating the total amount from this sub-section plus a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be defined as 's'. 

What quantity of honey ('s') would the beekeeper have in total from this scenario?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of honey in the combined sub-sections under the given conditions.

First, let's denote the amount of honey in each honey storage sub-section and each bee rearing sub-section as \( h \).

Given:
\[ h = \frac{25}{9} \text{ gallons} \]

When the beekeeper combines the honey from one honey storage sub-section and one bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey \( p \) is:
\[ p = h + h = \frac{25}{9} + \frac{25}{9} = \frac{50}{9} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, consider the scenario where one honey storage sub-section has an additional \( \frac{2}{26} \) gallons of honey. The total amount of honey in this honey storage sub-section is:
\[ h + \frac{2}{26} = \frac{25}{9} + \frac{2}{26} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 26 is 234. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{25}{9} = \frac{25 \times 26}{9 \times 26} = \frac{650}{234} \]
\[ \frac{2}{26} = \frac{2 \times 9}{26 \times 9} = \frac{18}{234} \]

Now, add these fractions:
\[ \frac{650}{234} + \frac{18}{234} = \frac{650 + 18}{234} = \frac{668}{234} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{668}{234} = \frac{334}{117} \]

Thus, the total amount of honey \( s \) in this scenario, combining the honey from this honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, is:
\[ s = \frac{334}{117} + \frac{25}{9} \]

Convert \( \frac{25}{9} \) to have the same denominator:
\[ \frac{25}{9} = \frac{25 \times 13}{9 \times 13} = \frac{325}{117} \]

Add the fractions:
\[ s = \frac{334}{117} + \frac{325}{117} = \frac{334 + 325}{117} = \frac{659}{117} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{659}{117} = \frac{659 \div 1}{117 \div 1} = \frac{659}{117} \]

Thus, the quantity of honey \( s \) the beekeeper would have in total from this scenario is:
\[ s = \frac{659}{117} \]

When he combines the honey from a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey is now represented by 'p'.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem with the updated quantities, we need to determine the total amount of honey in the combined sub-sections under the new conditions.

First, let's denote the amount of honey in each honey storage sub-section and each bee rearing sub-section as \( r \).

Given:
\[ r = \frac{25}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

When the beekeeper combines the honey from one honey storage sub-section and one bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey \( p \) is:
\[ p = r + r = \frac{25}{4} + \frac{25}{4} = \frac{50}{4} = 12.5 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, consider the scenario where one honey storage sub-section has an additional \( \frac{2}{26} \) gallons of honey. The total amount of honey in this honey storage sub-section is:
\[ r + \frac{2}{26} = \frac{25}{4} + \frac{2}{26} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 26 is 52. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{25}{4} = \frac{25 \times 13}{4 \times 13} = \frac{325}{52} \]
\[ \frac{2}{26} = \frac{2 \times 2}{26 \times 2} = \frac{4}{52} \]

Now, add these fractions:
\[ \frac{325}{52} + \frac{4}{52} = \frac{325 + 4}{52} = \frac{329}{52} \]

Thus, the total amount of honey \( s \) in this scenario, combining the honey from this honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, is:
\[ s = \frac{329}{52} + \frac{25}{4} \]

Convert \( \frac{25}{4} \) to have the same denominator:
\[ \frac{25}{4} = \frac{25 \times 13}{4 \times 13} = \frac{325}{52} \]

Add the fractions:
\[ s = \frac{329}{52} + \frac{325}{52} = \frac{329 + 325}{52} = \frac{654}{52} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{654}{52} = \frac{654 \div 2}{52 \div 2} = \frac{327}{26} \]

Thus, the quantity of honey \( s \) the beekeeper would have in total from this scenario is:
\[ s = \frac{327}{26} \]

            In prehistoric times, a herbivorous dinosaur eats 16/8 bunches of leaves per hour during the day. But at night, it only eats 6/17 bunches of leaves every hour because of reduced visibility. Calculate the total bunches of leaves the dinosaur eats in an hour if it is eating day and night.

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fraction for the bunches of leaves the dinosaur eats during the day:
\[ \frac{16}{8} = 2 \]

Next, we know the dinosaur eats \( \frac{6}{17} \) bunches of leaves every hour at night.

To find the total bunches of leaves the dinosaur eats in an hour if it is eating both day and night, we add the two amounts together:
\[ 2 + \frac{6}{17} \]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 2 (which can be written as \( \frac{34}{17} \)) and \( \frac{6}{17} \) is 17:
\[ 2 = \frac{34}{17} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{34}{17} + \frac{6}{17} = \frac{34 + 6}{17} = \frac{40}{17} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total bunches of leaves the dinosaur eats in an hour, we need to add the additional bunches of leaves it can eat per hour to the amount it was already eating.

From the previous calculation, the dinosaur eats:
\[ \frac{40}{17} \text{ bunches of leaves per hour} \]

Now, it can eat an additional:
\[ \frac{27}{13} \text{ bunches of leaves per hour} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 17 and 13 is 221.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 221:
\[ \frac{40}{17} = \frac{40 \times 13}{17 \times 13} = \frac{520}{221} \]
\[ \frac{27}{13} = \frac{27 \times 17}{13 \times 17} = \frac{459}{221} \]

Now, add the fractions:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total pounds of fish the bear ate over the three days, we need to add the fractions:

1. First day: \( \frac{28}{6} \)
2. Second day: \( \frac{21}{18} \)
3. Third day: \( \frac{24}{22} \)

Let's simplify each fraction first:

1. Simplify \( \frac{28}{6} \):
   \[
   \frac{28}{6} = \frac{14}{3}
   \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{21}{18} \):
   \[
   \frac{21}{18} = \frac{7}{6}
   \]

3. Simplify \( \frac{24}{22} \):
   \[
   \frac{24}{22} = \frac{12}{11}
   \]

Now, we need to add these fractions together. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 6, and 11 is 66.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 66:

1. \( \frac{14}{3} \):
   \[
   \frac{14}{3} = \frac{14 \times 22}{3 \times 22} = \frac{308}{66}
   \]

2. \( \frac{7}{6} \):
   \[
   \frac{7}{6} = \frac{7 \times 11}{6 \times 11} = \frac{77}{66}
   \]

3. \( \frac{12}{11} \):
   \[
   \frac{12}{11} = \frac{12 \times 6}{11 \times 6} = \frac{72}{66}
   \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{308}{66} + \frac{77}{66} + \frac{72}{66} = \frac{308 + 77 + 72}{66} = \frac{457}{66}

Now, we need to add these fractions together. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 18, and 11 is 198.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 198:

            Heather was preparing a special three-course dinner for her family. 

For the first course, she had a bread recipe that required 11/17 of a cup of sugar. In addition, she baked a custard for dessert that required another 6/2 cups of sugar. 

As her family loves sweet dishes, she decided to increase the total quantity of sugar by a factor of 29/21. How many cups of sugar did Heather use in total?

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the total amount of sugar Heather used in her recipes before increasing the quantity.

For the bread recipe, she used:
\[ \frac{11}{17} \text{ cups of sugar} \]

For the custard, she used:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ cups of sugar} \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ \frac{11}{17} + 3 \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 17 and 1 (since 3 can be written as \(\frac{3}{1}\)) is 17.

Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 17:
\[ 3 = \frac{3 \times 17}{1 \times 17} = \frac{51}{17} \]

Now add the fractions:
\[ \frac{11}{17} + \frac{51}{17} = \frac{11 + 51}{17} = \frac{62}{17} \]

Next, Heather decided to increase the total quantity of sugar by a factor of \(\frac{29}{21}\). So, we multiply the total amount of sugar by this factor:
\[ \frac{62}{17} \times \frac{29}{21} \]

Multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[ \frac{62 \times 29}{17 \times 21} = \frac{1798}{357} \]

To simplify \(\frac{1798}{357}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1798 and 357. The GCD is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the total amount of sugar Heather used is:
\[ \frac{1798}{357} \approx 5.04 \text{ cups} \]

For the bread recipe, she used:
\[ \frac{11}{25} \text{ cups of sugar} \]

For the custard, she used:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ cups of sugar} \]

Adding these amounts together:
\[ \frac{11}{25} + 3 \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 25 and 1 (since 3 can be written as \(\frac{3}{1}\)) is 25.

Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 25:

   \frac{360}{168} + \frac{105}{168} = \frac{360 + 105}{168} = \frac{465}{168}
   \]

2. The baker needs \( \frac{26}{20} \) gallons of milk for each cake.
   - Simplify \( \frac{26}{20} \):
   \[
   \frac{26}{20} = \frac{13}{10}
   \]

3. Multiply the baker's requirement by the guests' consumption:
   - Multiply \( \frac{13}{10} \) by \( \frac{465}{168} \):
   \[
   \frac{13}{10} \times \frac{465}{168} = \frac{13 \times 465}{10 \times 168} = \frac{6045}{1680}
   \]

4. Add the result to the guests' consumption:
   - Convert \( \frac{465}{168} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 1680:
   \[
   \frac{465}{168} = \frac{465 \times 10}{168 \times 10} = \frac{4650}{1680}
   \]

   - Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{4650}{1680} + \frac{6045}{1680} = \frac{4650 + 6045}{1680} = \frac{10695}{1680}
   \]

   - Simplify \( \frac{10695}{1680} \):
   \[
   \frac{10695}{1680} = \frac{10695 \div 15}{1680 \div 15} = \frac{713}{112}
   \]

            In preparation for a subsequent feast at King Arthur's castle, the royal baker has tweaked his recipes and now needs 19/20 gallons of milk for each cake he's baking, as opposed to the previous requirement of 26/20 gallons.

Calculate the new total amount of liquid (v) that will be consumed if the baker's revised requirement is multiplied by the guests' consumption (i), and then add this to the guests' original consumption (v). How much total liquid (x) will now be needed for the feast?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of liquid each guest will consume.
2. Calculate the total amount of liquid the baker needs for each cake with the revised requirement.
3. Multiply the baker's revised requirement by the guests' consumption.
4. Add the result to the guests' consumption to find the total amount of liquid needed.

Let's start with the guests' consumption:

1. Each guest consumes \( \frac{15}{7} \) gallons of water and \( \frac{15}{24} \) gallons of wine.
   - Total liquid per guest: 
   \[
   \frac{15}{7} + \frac{15}{24}
   \]

   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 24 is 168.

   - Convert \( \frac{15}{7} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 168:
   \[
   \frac{15}{7} = \frac{15 \times 24}{7 \times 24} = \frac{360}{168}
   \]

   - Convert \( \frac{15}{24} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 168:
   \[
   \frac{15}{24} = \frac{15 \times 7}{24 \times 7} = \frac{105}{168}
   \]

   - Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{360}{168} + \frac{105}{168} = \frac{360 + 105}{168} = \frac{465}{168}
   \]

2. The baker now needs \( \frac{19}{20} \) gallons of milk for each cake.
   - This fraction is already in its simplest form.

3. Multiply the baker's revised requirement by the guests' consumption:
   - Multiply \( \frac{19}{20} \) by \( \frac{465}{168} \):
   \[
   \frac{19}{20} \times \frac{465}{168} = \frac{19 \times 465}{20 \times 168} = \frac{8835}{3360}
   \]

4. Add the result to the guests' consumption:
   - Convert \( \frac{465}{168} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 3360:
   \[
   \frac{465}{168} = \frac{465 \times 20}{168 \times 20} = \frac{9300}{3360}
   \]

   - Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{9300}{3360} + \frac{8835}{3360} = \frac{9300 + 8835}{3360} = \frac{18135}{3360}
   \]

   - Simplify \( \frac{18135}{3360} \):
   \[
   \frac{18135}{3360} = \frac{18135 \div 15}{3360 \div 15} = \frac{1209}{224}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of addition and multiplication with fractions.

First, let's add the two fractions \( \frac{30}{17} \) and \( \frac{18}{15} \).

1. Find a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{30}{17} \) and \( \frac{18}{15} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 15 is 255.

2. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{30}{17} = \frac{30 \times 15}{17 \times 15} = \frac{450}{255}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{18}{15} = \frac{18 \times 17}{15 \times 17} = \frac{306}{255}
   \]

3. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{450}{255} + \frac{306}{255} = \frac{450 + 306}{255} = \frac{756}{255}
   \]

4. Simplify the fraction \( \frac{756}{255} \):
   \[
   \frac{756 \div 3}{255 \div 3} = \frac{252}{85}
   \]

Next, we need to multiply this result by \( \frac{24}{13} \).

5. Multiply the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{252}{85} \times \frac{24}{13} = \frac{252 \times 24}{85 \times 13} = \frac{6048}{1105}

Thus, Teddy's final number is \( \frac{6048}{1105} \).

            Johnny is building a scooter from scratch. He needs to drill holes into the scooter deck to attach the wheels. The size of each hole should be approximately (20/6) cm in diameter. Unfortunately, his drill bit only has a diameter of (11/21) cm. If he uses his current drill bit, he needs to drill a hole, move it over and drill again to achieve the diameter he needs. If he drills each hole exactly once with his drill bit, calculate what fraction of the desired diameter would each hole have? Don't simplify the fraction, keep as (20/6) * (11 / 21).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine what fraction of the desired diameter each hole would have if Johnny uses his current drill bit, we need to compare the diameter of the drill bit to the desired diameter.

The desired diameter is given as:
\[ \frac{20}{6} \text{ cm} \]

The diameter of the drill bit is:
\[ \frac{11}{21} \text{ cm} \]

To find the fraction of the desired diameter that each hole would have, we divide the diameter of the drill bit by the desired diameter:
\[ \frac{\frac{11}{21}}{\frac{20}{6}} \]

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:
\[ \frac{11}{21} \times \frac{6}{20} \]

Now, we multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[ \frac{11 \times 6}{21 \times 20} = \frac{66}{420} \]

Thus, each hole drilled with the current drill bit would be:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much less time the second model takes compared to the first one, we need to subtract the time taken for the second model from the time taken for the first model.

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator to make the subtraction easier. The denominators are 10 and 23. The least common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 23 is 230.

Convert \( \frac{17}{10} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 230:
\[ \frac{17}{10} = \frac{17 \times 23}{10 \times 23} = \frac{391}{230} \]

Convert \( \frac{12}{23} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 230:
\[ \frac{12}{23} = \frac{12 \times 10}{23 \times 10} = \frac{120}{230} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{391}{230} - \frac{120}{230} = \frac{391 - 120}{230} = \frac{271}{230} \]

The fraction \( \frac{271}{230} \) is already in its simplest form because 271 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 230.

            Carlos is very handy, and he decided to start a business making and selling chairs. He usually makes each chair using 20/15 units of wood. For a special order, he decided to design a larger, sturdier chair that uses (24/5) times (7/6) units more wood than usual. 

In total, how many units of wood would Carlos need to make one of these special chairs? Please give your answer in simplest form.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how much additional wood Carlos needs for the special chair. The additional wood required is given by the product of \(\frac{24}{5}\) and \(\frac{7}{6}\).

\[
\frac{24}{5} \times \frac{7}{6} = \frac{24 \times 7}{5 \times 6} = \frac{168}{30}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{168}{30}\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 168 and 30. The GCD of 168 and 30 is 6.

\[
\frac{168 \div 6}{30 \div 6} = \frac{28}{5}
\]

So, the additional wood required is \(\frac{28}{5}\) units.

Now, we need to add this to the usual amount of wood Carlos uses for a chair, which is \(\frac{20}{15}\). We simplify \(\frac{20}{15}\) first:

\[
\frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Now, we add \(\frac{4}{3}\) and \(\frac{28}{5}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 5 is 15.

\[
\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{20}{15}
\]

\[
\frac{28}{5} = \frac{28 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{84}{15}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{20}{15} + \frac{84}{15} = \frac{20 + 84}{15} = \frac{104}{15}

Thus, Carlos needs \(\frac{104}{15}\) units of wood to make one of these special chairs.

\frac{20}{8} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

Next, we calculate the additional wood required for the special feature, which is \(\frac{24}{5} \times \frac{7}{6}\):

\[
\frac{24}{5} \times \frac{7}{6} = \frac{24 \times 7}{5 \times 6} = \frac{168}{30}
\]

We simplify \(\frac{168}{30}\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 168 and 30, which is 6:

\[
\frac{168 \div 6}{30 \div 6} = \frac{28}{5}
\]

Now, we add the amount of wood required for the basic chair (\(\frac{5}{2}\)) to the additional wood required for the special feature (\(\frac{28}{5}\)). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 5 is 10.

\[
\frac{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 5}{2 \times 5} = \frac{25}{10}
\]

\[
\frac{28}{5} = \frac{28 \times 2}{5 \times 2} = \frac{56}{10}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{25}{10} + \frac{56}{10} = \frac{25 + 56}{10} = \frac{81}{10}
\]

Thus, Carlos now needs \(\frac{81}{10}\) units of wood to make one of these larger special design chairs.

            Officer Davis was monitoring traffic for speeders. He was measuring the speed of cars passing by him using a radar gun. The gun showed one car was going 13/4 miles per minute. Suddenly, the car slows down and reduces his speed by 14/15 miles per minute. Officer Davis noted down the new speed of the car. Suddenly, the car increased its speed again by 30/15 miles per minute. What was the final speed of the car according to Officer Davis's radar gun?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the final speed of the car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Speed**: The car was initially going at \( \frac{13}{4} \) miles per minute.

2. **Speed Reduction**: The car then reduced its speed by \( \frac{14}{15} \) miles per minute. We need to subtract this from the initial speed:
   \[
   \frac{13}{4} - \frac{14}{15}
   \]

   To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 15 is 60. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{13}{4} = \frac{13 \times 15}{4 \times 15} = \frac{195}{60}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{14}{15} = \frac{14 \times 4}{15 \times 4} = \frac{56}{60}
   \]

   Now, subtract the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{195}{60} - \frac{56}{60} = \frac{195 - 56}{60} = \frac{139}{60}
   \]

3. **Speed Increase**: The car then increased its speed by \( \frac{30}{15} \) miles per minute. Simplify \( \frac{30}{15} \):
   \[
   \frac{30}{15} = 2
   \]

   We need to add this to the current speed:
   \[
   \frac{139}{60} + 2
   \]

   Convert 2 to a fraction with a denominator of 60:
   \[
   2 = \frac{120}{60}
   \]

   Now, add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{139}{60} + \frac{120}{60} = \frac{139 + 120}{60} = \frac{259}{60}
   \]

Thus, the final speed of the car according to Officer Davis's radar gun is \( \frac{259}{60} \) miles per minute.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the final speed of the car after the additional increase, we need to add \( \frac{14}{29} \) miles per minute to the current speed of \( \frac{259}{60} \) miles per minute.

1. **Current Speed**: The current speed of the car is \( \frac{259}{60} \) miles per minute.

2. **Additional Increase**: The car's speed increased by \( \frac{14}{29} \) miles per minute.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 29 is 1740. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{259}{60} = \frac{259 \times 29}{60 \times 29} = \frac{7511}{1740}
\]

\[
\frac{14}{29} = \frac{14 \times 60}{29 \times 60} = \frac{840}{1740}

Now, add the fractions:

\[
\frac{7511}{1740} + \frac{840}{1740} = \frac{7511 + 840}{1740} = \frac{8351}{1740}

            Jake is trying to figure out how many grapes he can get from a certain vineyard. 

- The vineyard can usually produce 19/2 baskets of grapes every season. However, due to weather conditions, only 19/29 of the usual amount were produced this season. How many baskets of grapes were produced this season?

- But Jake isn't the only one interested in these grapes. He has to share the grapes with others. He gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes. How many baskets of grapes does he get?

- Out of the grapes that he got, Jake wants to make some grape juice. But he only uses 9/10 of his grapes to make the juice. How many baskets of grapes does he use for the juice?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculating the number of baskets produced this season:**
   - The usual production is \( \frac{19}{2} \) baskets.
   - This season, only \( \frac{19}{29} \) of the usual amount was produced.
   - To find the number of baskets produced this season, we multiply the usual production by the fraction produced this season:
     \[
     \text{Baskets produced this season} = \left( \frac{19}{2} \right) \times \left( \frac{19}{29} \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying the multiplication:
     \[
     \left( \frac{19}{2} \right) \times \left( \frac{19}{29} \right) = \frac{19 \times 19}{2 \times 29} = \frac{361}{58}
     \]
   - Simplifying the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{361}{58} = \frac{361 \div 29}{58 \div 29} = \frac{12.4483}{2} = 6.2241
     \]
   - Therefore, the vineyard produced approximately 6.2241 baskets of grapes this season.

2. **Calculating the number of baskets Jake gets to keep:**
   - Jake gets to keep \( \frac{7}{11} \) of the total amount of grapes.
   - To find the number of baskets Jake gets, we multiply the total baskets produced by \( \frac{7}{11} \):
     \[
     \text{Baskets Jake gets} = 6.2241 \times \frac{7}{11}
     \]
   - Simplifying the multiplication:
     \[
     6.2241 \times \frac{7}{11} = 6.2241 \times 0.6364 = 3.961
     \]
   - Therefore, Jake gets approximately 3.961 baskets of grapes.

3. **Calculating the number of baskets Jake uses for grape juice:**
   - Jake uses \( \frac{9}{10} \) of his grapes to make juice.
   - To find the number of baskets Jake uses for juice, we multiply the number of baskets he gets by \( \frac{9}{10} \):
     \[
     \text{Baskets used for juice} = 3.961 \times \frac{9}{10}
     \]
   - Simplifying the multiplication:
     \[
     3.961 \times \frac{9}{10} = 3.961 \times 0.9 = 3.5649
     \]
   - Therefore, Jake uses approximately 3.5649 baskets of grapes to make juice.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of bushels of grapes Joel picked, we need to add the bushels of red grapes and green grapes together.

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator if necessary. However, in this case, we can directly add the fractions since they are already in a simple form.

The red grapes picked are:
\[ \frac{9}{2} \]

The green grapes picked are:
\[ \frac{10}{22} \]

We can simplify \(\frac{10}{22}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[ \frac{10 \div 2}{22 \div 2} = \frac{5}{11} \]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{9}{2}\) and \(\frac{5}{11}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 11 is 22.

Convert \(\frac{9}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 22:
\[ \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9 \times 11}{2 \times 11} = \frac{99}{22} \]

Now we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{99}{22} + \frac{5}{11} = \frac{99}{22} + \frac{5 \times 2}{11 \times 2} = \frac{99}{22} + \frac{10}{22} = \frac{99 + 10}{22} = \frac{109}{22} \]

So, the total number of bushels of grapes Joel picked that day is:

The ratio of bushels of juice per bushel of grapes is \(\frac{25}{17}\).

To find the total bushels of juice, we multiply these two fractions:

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator if necessary. However, in this case, we can directly add the fractions since they are already in a simple form.

The corrected red grapes picked are:
\[ \frac{9}{3} \]

The green grapes picked are:

We can simplify \(\frac{10}{22}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[ \frac{10 \div 2}{22 \div 2} = \frac{5}{11} \]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{9}{3}\) and \(\frac{5}{11}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 11 is 33.

Convert \(\frac{9}{3}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 33:
\[ \frac{9}{3} = \frac{9 \times 11}{3 \times 11} = \frac{99}{33} \]

Convert \(\frac{5}{11}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 33:

Now we can add the two fractions:

What is the total height of the snowman in feet when these two snowballs are stacked on top of each other?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total height of the snowman, we need to add the diameters of the two snowballs.

First, let's convert the diameters to a common fraction format for easier addition:

1. The diameter of the larger snowball is \( \frac{17}{8} \) feet.
2. The diameter of the smaller snowball is \( \frac{1}{20} \) feet.

Next, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 20 is 40.

Convert \( \frac{17}{8} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:
\[ \frac{17}{8} = \frac{17 \times 5}{8 \times 5} = \frac{85}{40} \]

Convert \( \frac{1}{20} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:
\[ \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1 \times 2}{20 \times 2} = \frac{2}{40} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{85}{40} + \frac{2}{40} = \frac{85 + 2}{40} = \frac{87}{40} \]

Thus, the total height of the snowman is \( \frac{87}{40} \) feet.

To convert this to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{87}{40} = 2 \frac{7}{40} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total height of the snowman with the hat, we need to add the height of the hat to the previously calculated height of the snowman.

The height of the snowman without the hat is \( \frac{87}{40} \) feet.

The height of the hat is \( \frac{14}{19} \) feet.

To add these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 40 and 19 is 760.

Convert \( \frac{87}{40} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 760:
\[ \frac{87}{40} = \frac{87 \times 19}{40 \times 19} = \frac{1653}{760} \]

Convert \( \frac{14}{19} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 760:
\[ \frac{14}{19} = \frac{14 \times 40}{19 \times 40} = \frac{560}{760} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{1653}{760} + \frac{560}{760} = \frac{1653 + 560}{760} = \frac{2213}{760} \]

Thus, the total height of the snowman with the hat is \( \frac{2213}{760} \) feet.

To convert this to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{2213}{760} = 2 \frac{693}{760} \]

            In our previous snowman, the larger snowball at the bottom had a diameter of 17/8 feet. Now imagine that the larger snowball had a larger diameter of 17/6 feet instead.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total height of the snowman with the new diameters, we need to add the diameters of the two snowballs.

1. The diameter of the larger snowball is now \( \frac{17}{6} \) feet.
2. The diameter of the smaller snowball remains \( \frac{1}{20} \) feet.

First, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 20 is 60.

Convert \( \frac{17}{6} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60:
\[ \frac{17}{6} = \frac{17 \times 10}{6 \times 10} = \frac{170}{60} \]

Convert \( \frac{1}{20} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60:
\[ \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1 \times 3}{20 \times 3} = \frac{3}{60} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{170}{60} + \frac{3}{60} = \frac{170 + 3}{60} = \frac{173}{60} \]

Thus, the total height of the snowman is \( \frac{173}{60} \) feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fractions involved.

The initial amount of sand is \( \frac{24}{7} \).

The amount of sand taken away is \( \frac{2}{16} \). Simplifying \( \frac{2}{16} \):
\[ \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \]

Now, we need to subtract \( \frac{1}{8} \) from \( \frac{24}{7} \).

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 8 is 56.

Convert \( \frac{24}{7} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 56:
\[ \frac{24}{7} = \frac{24 \times 8}{7 \times 8} = \frac{192}{56} \]

Convert \( \frac{1}{8} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 56:
\[ \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1 \times 7}{8 \times 7} = \frac{7}{56} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{192}{56} - \frac{7}{56} = \frac{192 - 7}{56} = \frac{185}{56} \]

Thus, the remaining part of the sand in the sandbox is \( \frac{185}{56} \).

The initial amount of sand is \( \frac{24}{16} \).

Simplify \( \frac{24}{16} \):
\[ \frac{24}{16} = \frac{3}{2} \]

The amount of sand taken away is \( \frac{2}{16} \). Simplify \( \frac{2}{16} \):
\[ \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \]

Now, we need to subtract \( \frac{1}{8} \) from \( \frac{3}{2} \).

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 8 is 8.

Convert \( \frac{3}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 8:
\[ \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3 \times 4}{2 \times 4} = \frac{12}{8} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{12}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{12 - 1}{8} = \frac{11}{8} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much less of the zebra the lion ate compared to the wildebeest, we need to subtract the fraction of the zebra eaten from the fraction of the wildebeest eaten.

First, let's write down the fractions:
- Zebra: \( \frac{28}{26} \)
- Wildebeest: \( \frac{23}{9} \)

We need to subtract \( \frac{28}{26} \) from \( \frac{23}{9} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 26 and 9 is 234.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 234:
- For the zebra: 
  \[
  \frac{28}{26} = \frac{28 \times 9}{26 \times 9} = \frac{252}{234}
  \]
- For the wildebeest:
  \[
  \frac{23}{9} = \frac{23 \times 26}{9 \times 26} = \frac{598}{234}
  \]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{598}{234} - \frac{252}{234} = \frac{598 - 252}{234} = \frac{346}{234}
\]

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{346}{234} \):
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 346 and 234 is 2.
- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
  \[
  \frac{346 \div 2}{234 \div 2} = \frac{173}{117}

First, let's write down the fractions:

- Wildebeest: \( \frac{23}{9} \)

We need to subtract \( \frac{28}{26} \) from \( \frac{23}{9} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 26 and 9 is 234.

Thus, the simplified fraction is \( \frac{173}{117} \).

Next, we need to calculate \( \frac{21}{4} \) of this difference:
\[

Multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[
\frac{21 \times 173}{4 \times 117} = \frac{3633}{468}

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{3633}{468} \):
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3633 and 468 is 3.
- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the expected number of bananas produced by the two species of banana trees on any given day, we use the given formula:

\[
\text{Expected number of bananas} = \left(\frac{12}{29}\right) + \left(\frac{30}{10}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the contribution from the first species:

\[
\frac{12}{29} \approx 0.4138

Next, we calculate the contribution from the second species:

\[
\frac{30}{10} = 3

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fractions given:

1. The fraction \( \frac{11}{11} \) simplifies to 1 because any number divided by itself is 1.
2. The fraction \( \frac{26}{14} \) can be simplified by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 26 and 14, which is 2. 

So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[ \frac{26 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{13}{7} \]

Now, we need to add the simplified fractions:
\[ 1 + \frac{13}{7} \]

To add these fractions, we convert 1 to a fraction with the same denominator as \( \frac{13}{7} \):
\[ 1 = \frac{7}{7} \]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{7}{7} + \frac{13}{7} = \frac{7 + 13}{7} = \frac{20}{7} \]

Thus, the total ton of food the giraffe needs to eat in a day is:
\[ \frac{20}{7} \]

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fraction for the water consumption:

\[ \frac{10}{30} \]

We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 30, which is 10. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 10:

\[ \frac{10 \div 10}{30 \div 10} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, we need to add this to the total weight of food the giraffe consumes, which we previously calculated as \( \frac{20}{7} \) tons.

To add \( \frac{20}{7} \) and \( \frac{1}{3} \), we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 3 is 21.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 21:

\[ \frac{20}{7} = \frac{20 \times 3}{7 \times 3} = \frac{60}{21} \]

\[ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 7}{3 \times 7} = \frac{7}{21} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{60}{21} + \frac{7}{21} = \frac{60 + 7}{21} = \frac{67}{21} \]

Thus, the total weight of food and water that the giraffe consumes in a day is:

Assume that the bear has a regular sleeping pattern. Calculate the fraction of time the bear has spent sleeping over the 27 days assuming each month has 13 weeks.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The bear spends 18 hours out of 24 hours each day sleeping. This can be expressed as a fraction:
   \[
   \frac{18}{24}
   \]

2. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{18}{24} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

3. The bear's activity is tracked for 27 days. We need to find the fraction of time the bear has spent sleeping over these 27 days. We are given that each month has 13 weeks, but this information is not necessary for our calculation.

4. Calculate the fraction of time the bear has spent sleeping over 27 days:
   \[
   \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \times 27
   \]

5. Convert the fraction to a decimal:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
   \]

6. Multiply by 27:
   \[
   0.75 \times 27 = 20.25
   \]

Therefore, the bear has spent 20.25 days sleeping over the 27 days.

1. Convert \(\frac{19}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 14:
   \[
   \frac{19}{2} = \frac{19 \times 7}{2 \times 7} = \frac{133}{14}

            On planet Zog, aliens use an interesting system to track their energy levels. At the beginning of the day, Zogorian calculates his energy level to be (14 / 2) / (23 / 17) zogs. Later in the day, after harnessing energy from their primary star, his energy level increases by (16 / 24) zogs. Calculate the Zogorian's energy level after the increase.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to calculate the initial energy level of the Zogorian.

The initial energy level is given by:
\[
\frac{\left(\frac{14}{2}\right)}{\left(\frac{23}{17}\right)}
\]

First, simplify the numerator and the denominator separately:
\[
\frac{14}{2} = 7
\]
\[
\frac{23}{17} \text{ remains as it is.}
\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{7}{\frac{23}{17}}
\]

To divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal:
\[
\frac{7}{\frac{23}{17}} = 7 \times \frac{17}{23} = \frac{7 \times 17}{23} = \frac{119}{23}
\]

Next, we need to add the increase in energy level, which is:
\[
\frac{16}{24}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{16}{24}\):
\[
\frac{16}{24} = \frac{2 \times 8}{3 \times 8} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Now, add this to the initial energy level:
\[
\frac{119}{23} + \frac{2}{3}
\]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 23 and 3 is 69:
\[
\frac{119}{23} = \frac{119 \times 3}{23 \times 3} = \frac{357}{69}
\]
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 23}{3 \times 23} = \frac{46}{69}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{357}{69} + \frac{46}{69} = \frac{357 + 46}{69} = \frac{403}{69}
\]

Thus, the Zogorian's energy level after the increase is:

\frac{403}{69}

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the Zogorian's new energy level after using the device, we need to multiply the current energy level by the given factor.

The current energy level is:
\[
\frac{403}{69}
\]

The factor by which the energy level is multiplied is:
\[
\frac{18}{11}
\]

Now, multiply these two fractions:
\[
\frac{403}{69} \times \frac{18}{11}
\]

Multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[
\frac{403 \times 18}{69 \times 11}
\]

Calculate the products:
\[
403 \times 18 = 7254
\]
\[
69 \times 11 = 759
\]

So, the new energy level is:
\[
\frac{7254}{759}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7254 and 759. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(7254 \div 759 \approx 9.55\), so the integer part is 9.
2. \(7254 - 759 \times 9 = 7254 - 6831 = 423\)
3. \(759 \div 423 \approx 1.79\), so the integer part is 1.
4. \(759 - 423 = 336\)
5. \(423 \div 336 \approx 1.26\), so the integer part is 1.
6. \(423 - 336 = 87\)
7. \(336 \div 87 \approx 3.86\), so the integer part is 3.
8. \(336 - 87 \times 3 = 336 - 261 = 75\)
9. \(87 \div 75 \approx 1.16\), so the integer part is 1.
10. \(87 - 75 = 12\)
11. \(75 \div 12 \approx 6.25\), so the integer part is 6.
12. \(75 - 12 \times 6 = 75 - 72 = 3\)
13. \(12 \div 3 = 4\), so the integer part is 4.
14. \(12 - 3 \times 4 = 0\)

The GCD is 3. Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[
\frac{7254 \div 3}{759 \div 3} = \frac{2418}{253}
\]

Thus, the Zogorian's new energy level is:
\[

\frac{2856}{552} + \frac{529}{552} = \frac{2856 + 529}{552} = \frac{3385}{552}
\]

Thus, the Zogorian's energy level after the larger increase is:
\[
\frac{3385}{552}
\]

            Teddy, the bear, loves to play hide and seek with his friends. One day, he decided to play a game where he hides some number of his stuffed animal friends. Teddy hides 18/11 of his friends in the forest and 8/21 of his friends at the beach. First calculate how many more friends Teddy hides in the forest than at the beach. Let's call this number 'f'. Then square 'f' to find 'n', the total number of hiding spots Teddy needs. How many hiding spots does Teddy need?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find how many more friends Teddy hides in the forest than at the beach, we need to subtract the fraction of friends hidden at the beach from the fraction hidden in the forest.

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{18}{11}\) and \(\frac{8}{21}\). The least common multiple of 11 and 21 is 231.

Convert \(\frac{18}{11}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 231:
\[
\frac{18}{11} = \frac{18 \times 21}{11 \times 21} = \frac{378}{231}
\]

Convert \(\frac{8}{21}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 231:
\[
\frac{8}{21} = \frac{8 \times 11}{21 \times 11} = \frac{88}{231}
\]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[
\frac{378}{231} - \frac{88}{231} = \frac{378 - 88}{231} = \frac{290}{231}
\]

So, the number of friends Teddy hides more in the forest than at the beach is \(\frac{290}{231}\).

Next, we need to square this number to find the total number of hiding spots, \(n\):
\[
\left(\frac{290}{231}\right)^2 = \frac{290^2}{231^2} = \frac{84100}{53361}
\]

Thus, the total number of hiding spots Teddy needs is \(\frac{84100}{53361}\).

            After hiding all his friends, Teddy, the bear, thinks about a new challenge. He decides to tack on an extra task that each of his friends must complete. The task involves going through an obstacle course, and only 18/28 of his friends decide to take on the new challenge. Teddy decides that the new challenge will require as many action points as there were hiding spots, but multiplied by the fraction of his friends who decided to take on the challenge. This is represented by 'o' = (18/28) * 'n'. 

So, calculate 'o', how many total action points are needed for Teddy's new challenge?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the total action points needed for Teddy's new challenge, we need to multiply the fraction of friends who decided to take on the challenge by the number of hiding spots, \(n\).

First, let's simplify the fraction \(\frac{18}{28}\):
\[
\frac{18}{28} = \frac{9}{14}
\]

We previously calculated the number of hiding spots, \(n\), as \(\frac{84100}{53361}\).

Now, we need to multiply \(\frac{9}{14}\) by \(\frac{84100}{53361}\):
\[
o = \frac{9}{14} \times \frac{84100}{53361}
\]

To perform the multiplication of these fractions:
\[
o = \frac{9 \times 84100}{14 \times 53361} = \frac{756900}{747054}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 756900 and 747054. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the GCD is 6.

So, we simplify the fraction:
\[
o = \frac{756900 \div 6}{747054 \div 6} = \frac{126150}{124509}
\]

Thus, the total action points needed for Teddy's new challenge is \(\frac{126150}{124509}\).

            As Teddy's game continues, he changes the number of friends he initially hides. This time, he hides 21/11 of his friends in the forest instead of 18/11, while still hiding 8/21 of his friends at the beach. Now first calculate how many more friends Teddy hides in the forest than at the beach, using this new number. Let's still call this number 'f'.

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{21}{11}\) and \(\frac{8}{21}\). The least common multiple of 11 and 21 is 231.

Convert \(\frac{21}{11}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 231:
\[
\frac{21}{11} = \frac{21 \times 21}{11 \times 21} = \frac{441}{231}
\]

Convert \(\frac{8}{21}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 231:
\[
\frac{8}{21} = \frac{8 \times 11}{21 \times 11} = \frac{88}{231}

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[
\frac{441}{231} - \frac{88}{231} = \frac{441 - 88}{231} = \frac{353}{231}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much energy the robot has left, we need to subtract the energy used from the initial energy.

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator to make the subtraction easier. The initial energy is \( \frac{25}{10} \) and the energy used is \( \frac{27}{23} \).

1. Simplify \( \frac{25}{10} \):
\[ \frac{25}{10} = 2.5 \]

2. Convert \( 2.5 \) to a fraction with the same denominator as \( \frac{27}{23} \):
\[ 2.5 = \frac{2.5 \times 23}{1 \times 23} = \frac{57.5}{23} \]

3. Now, subtract \( \frac{27}{23} \) from \( \frac{57.5}{23} \):
\[ \frac{57.5}{23} - \frac{27}{23} = \frac{57.5 - 27}{23} = \frac{30.5}{23} \]

So, the robot has \( \frac{30.5}{23} \) units of energy left.

            During rainy weather, a small snail moves at a snail-pace covering 17/21 of a meter in an hour. Another slightly faster snail covers 20/24 of a meter in the same time during such weather. 

One rainy day, the first snail started an hour earlier than the second. At the time when the second snail began, a third snail that covers 18/17 of a meter per hour also started moving. 

What is their total distance in meters 1 hour after all three have started moving? Compute the result using the operation ((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) for the first two snails' distance, and multiply this result by (18 / 17) for the total distance , including the third snail.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance covered by each snail and then sum these distances.

First, let's simplify the distances covered by the first two snails in one hour.

1. The first snail covers \( \frac{17}{21} \) meters in one hour.
2. The second snail covers \( \frac{20}{24} \) meters in one hour. Simplifying \( \frac{20}{24} \):
   \[
   \frac{20}{24} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]

Now, we add the distances covered by the first two snails:
\[
\frac{17}{21} + \frac{5}{6}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 21 and 6 is 42.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 42:
\[
\frac{17}{21} = \frac{17 \times 2}{21 \times 2} = \frac{34}{42}
\]
\[
\frac{5}{6} = \frac{5 \times 7}{6 \times 7} = \frac{35}{42}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{34}{42} + \frac{35}{42} = \frac{34 + 35}{42} = \frac{69}{42}
\]

Next, we need to consider the third snail, which covers \( \frac{18}{17} \) meters in one hour.

The total distance covered by all three snails in one hour is:
\[
\left( \frac{69}{42} \right) + \left( \frac{18}{17} \right)
\]

To find the total distance, we need to add these two fractions. First, we need a common denominator for \( \frac{69}{42} \) and \( \frac{18}{17} \). The least common multiple of 42 and 17 is 714.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 714:
\[
\frac{69}{42} = \frac{69 \times 17}{42 \times 17} = \frac{1173}{714}
\]
\[
\frac{18}{17} = \frac{18 \times 42}{17 \times 42} = \frac{756}{714}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1173}{714} + \frac{756}{714} = \frac{1173 + 756}{714} = \frac{1929}{714}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{1929}{714} = \frac{1929 \div 3}{714 \div 3} = \frac{643}{238}
\]

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the difference between the original amount of fabric and the remaining fabric.

Original fabric: \(\frac{24}{14}\) yards
Remaining fabric: \(\frac{9}{29}\) yards

To find the difference, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 14 and 29 is 406.

Convert \(\frac{24}{14}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 406:
\[
\frac{24}{14} = \frac{24 \times 29}{14 \times 29} = \frac{696}{406}
\]

Convert \(\frac{9}{29}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 406:
\[
\frac{9}{29} = \frac{9 \times 14}{29 \times 14} = \frac{126}{406}
\]

Now, subtract the remaining fabric from the original fabric:
\[
\frac{696}{406} - \frac{126}{406} = \frac{696 - 126}{406} = \frac{570}{406}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{570}{406}\):
\[
\frac{570}{406} = \frac{285}{203}
\]

Next, Johnny used \(\frac{15}{2}\) times this difference to make more stuffed animals. Multiply \(\frac{15}{2}\) by \(\frac{285}{203}\):
\[
\frac{15}{2} \times \frac{285}{203} = \frac{15 \times 285}{2 \times 203} = \frac{4275}{406}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{4275}{406}\):
\[
\frac{4275}{406} = \frac{4275 \div 5}{406 \div 5} = \frac{855}{81.2} = \frac{855 \div 5}{81.2 \div 5} = \frac{171}{16.24}

            Now let's consider that Johnny had originally miscalculated the amount of fabric he had left after creating the first few stuffed animals. Instead of having 9/29 of a yard left, he actually had 8/29 of a yard left. Keeping the calculation for the new fabric the same, i.e., using 15/2 times the difference of the original and the remaining fabric to make more stuffed animals, how many yards of the new fabric did Johnny use this time?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the difference between the original amount of fabric and the corrected remaining fabric.

Original fabric: \(\frac{24}{14}\) yards
Corrected remaining fabric: \(\frac{8}{29}\) yards

To find the difference, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 14 and 29 is 406.

Convert \(\frac{24}{14}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 406:
\[
\frac{24}{14} = \frac{24 \times 29}{14 \times 29} = \frac{696}{406}
\]

Convert \(\frac{8}{29}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 406:
\[
\frac{8}{29} = \frac{8 \times 14}{29 \times 14} = \frac{112}{406}
\]

Now, subtract the corrected remaining fabric from the original fabric:
\[
\frac{696}{406} - \frac{112}{406} = \frac{696 - 112}{406} = \frac{584}{406}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{584}{406}\):
\[
\frac{584}{406} = \frac{292}{203}
\]

Next, Johnny used \(\frac{15}{2}\) times this difference to make more stuffed animals. Multiply \(\frac{15}{2}\) by \(\frac{292}{203}\):
\[
\frac{15}{2} \times \frac{292}{203} = \frac{15 \times 292}{2 \times 203} = \frac{4380}{406}

Simplify \(\frac{4380}{406}\):
\[
\frac{4380}{406} = \frac{2190}{203}

Thus, Johnny used \(\frac{2190}{203}\) yards of the new fabric.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of kids waiting for the swings, we need to add the fractions \( \frac{2}{10} \) and \( \frac{21}{4} \).

First, let's simplify \( \frac{2}{10} \):
\[ \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Next, we need a common denominator to add \( \frac{1}{5} \) and \( \frac{21}{4} \). The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20.

Convert \( \frac{1}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 20:
\[ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1 \times 4}{5 \times 4} = \frac{4}{20} \]

Convert \( \frac{21}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 20:
\[ \frac{21}{4} = \frac{21 \times 5}{4 \times 5} = \frac{105}{20} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{4}{20} + \frac{105}{20} = \frac{4 + 105}{20} = \frac{109}{20} \]

So, the total number of kids waiting for the swings is \( \frac{109}{20} \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new total number of children waiting for the swings, we need to add the fractions \( \frac{2}{27} \) and \( \frac{21}{4} \).

First, we need a common denominator to add \( \frac{2}{27} \) and \( \frac{21}{4} \). The least common multiple of 27 and 4 is 108.

Convert \( \frac{2}{27} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 108:
\[ \frac{2}{27} = \frac{2 \times 4}{27 \times 4} = \frac{8}{108} \]

Convert \( \frac{21}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 108:
\[ \frac{21}{4} = \frac{21 \times 27}{4 \times 27} = \frac{567}{108} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{8}{108} + \frac{567}{108} = \frac{8 + 567}{108} = \frac{575}{108} \]

So, the new total number of children waiting for the swings is \( \frac{575}{108} \).

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much of a can the cat eats in one day, we need to add the amount it eats in the morning to the amount it eats in the evening.

First, let's simplify the fractions if possible:

Morning: \( \frac{16}{12} \)
Evening: \( \frac{6}{10} \)

Simplify \( \frac{16}{12} \):
\[ \frac{16}{12} = \frac{4 \times 4}{4 \times 3} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Simplify \( \frac{6}{10} \):
\[ \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3 \times 2}{5 \times 2} = \frac{3}{5} \]

Now, we need to add \( \frac{4}{3} \) and \( \frac{3}{5} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15.

Convert \( \frac{4}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[ \frac{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 5}{3 \times 5} = \frac{20}{15} \]

Convert \( \frac{3}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[ \frac{3}{5} = \frac{3 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{9}{15} \]

Now add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{20}{15} + \frac{9}{15} = \frac{20 + 9}{15} = \frac{29}{15} \]

So, the cat eats \( \frac{29}{15} \) of a can of cat food in one day.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total amount of cat food the cat eats in one day with the new morning serving size, we need to add the new morning portion to the evening portion.

The new morning portion is \( \frac{16}{21} \) of a can.
The evening portion remains \( \frac{6}{10} \) of a can.

First, let's simplify \( \frac{6}{10} \):
\[ \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5} \]

Next, we need to add \( \frac{16}{21} \) and \( \frac{3}{5} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 21 and 5 is 105.

Convert \( \frac{16}{21} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 105:
\[ \frac{16}{21} = \frac{16 \times 5}{21 \times 5} = \frac{80}{105} \]

Convert \( \frac{3}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 105:
\[ \frac{3}{5} = \frac{3 \times 21}{5 \times 21} = \frac{63}{105} \]

Now add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{80}{105} + \frac{63}{105} = \frac{80 + 63}{105} = \frac{143}{105} \]

So, the cat eats \( \frac{143}{105} \) of a can of cat food in one day with the new morning serving size.

\[ \text{Average number of eggs per nest in the first group} = \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the average number of eggs per nest for the second group of nests.

The second group has 4 nests with 11 eggs in each nest:
\[ \text{Total eggs in the second group} = 4 \times 11 = 44 \]
\[ \text{Average number of eggs per nest in the second group} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

            A monkey finds a pile of bananas and ends up eating (22 / 7) times (10 / 25) of the pile. Later, he gives (3 / 28) of the pile to his friend. How much of the pile does the monkey have left?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much of the pile the monkey has left, we need to calculate the fractions of the pile that the monkey ate and gave away, and then subtract these from the whole pile.

First, let's calculate the fraction of the pile the monkey ate:
\[
\frac{22}{7} \times \frac{10}{25}
\]

We can simplify this multiplication by simplifying the fractions first:
\[
\frac{22}{7} \times \frac{10}{25} = \frac{22 \times 10}{7 \times 25} = \frac{220}{175}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{220}{175}\):
\[
\frac{220}{175} = \frac{220 \div 5}{175 \div 5} = \frac{44}{35}
\]

So, the monkey ate \(\frac{44}{35}\) of the pile.

Next, let's calculate the fraction of the pile the monkey gave to his friend:
\[
\frac{3}{28}
\]

Now, we need to find the total fraction of the pile that the monkey has given away:
\[
\frac{44}{35} + \frac{3}{28}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 35 and 28 is 140. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{44}{35} = \frac{44 \times 4}{35 \times 4} = \frac{176}{140}
\]
\[
\frac{3}{28} = \frac{3 \times 5}{28 \times 5} = \frac{15}{140}
\]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{176}{140} + \frac{15}{140} = \frac{176 + 15}{140} = \frac{191}{140}
\]

This is the total fraction of the pile that the monkey has eaten and given away. To find out how much of the pile the monkey has left, we subtract this from the whole pile (which is 1):
\[
1 - \frac{191}{140}
\]

We convert 1 to a fraction with the same denominator:
\[
1 = \frac{140}{140}
\]

Now, we perform the subtraction:
\[
\frac{140}{140} - \frac{191}{140} = \frac{140 - 191}{140} = \frac{-51}{140}
\]

Since a negative fraction doesn't make sense in this context, it indicates that the monkey has eaten and given away more than the whole pile, which suggests an error in the problem setup or interpretation. However, based on the calculations, the monkey has effectively consumed and given away more than the entire pile.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many feet the mouse runs, we need to multiply the speed of the mouse by the time it runs.

The speed of the mouse is given as \( \frac{24}{20} \) feet per second. Simplifying this fraction, we get:
\[ \frac{24}{20} = \frac{6}{5} \text{ feet per second} \]

The time the mouse runs is given as \( \frac{23}{2} \) seconds.

Now, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ \text{Distance} = \left( \frac{6}{5} \text{ feet per second} \right) \times \left( \frac{23}{2} \text{ seconds} \right) \]

To multiply these fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{6 \times 23}{5 \times 2} = \frac{138}{10} \]

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine how many ounces of beverage were consumed initially. Each glass contains \( \frac{29}{9} \) ounces, and \( \frac{26}{25} \) of these glasses were consumed.

To find the total ounces consumed initially, we multiply:
\[
\frac{29}{9} \times \frac{26}{25} = \frac{29 \times 26}{9 \times 25} = \frac{754}{225}
\]

Next, we need to add the additional \( \frac{2}{19} \) ounces consumed later:
\[
\frac{754}{225} + \frac{2}{19}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 225 and 19 is 4275. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{754}{225} = \frac{754 \times 19}{225 \times 19} = \frac{14326}{4275}
\]
\[
\frac{2}{19} = \frac{2 \times 225}{19 \times 225} = \frac{450}{4275}
\]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{14326}{4275} + \frac{450}{4275} = \frac{14326 + 450}{4275} = \frac{14776}{4275}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine how many ounces of beverage were consumed initially. Each glass contains \( \frac{29}{9} \) ounces, and \( \frac{26}{25} \) of these glasses were consumed.

To find the total ounces consumed initially, we multiply:
\[
\frac{29}{9} \times \frac{26}{25} = \frac{29 \times 26}{9 \times 25} = \frac{754}{225}
\]

Next, we need to add the additional \( \frac{4}{19} \) ounces consumed later:
\[
\frac{754}{225} + \frac{4}{19}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 225 and 19 is 4275. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{754}{225} = \frac{754 \times 19}{225 \times 19} = \frac{14326}{4275}
\]
\[
\frac{4}{19} = \frac{4 \times 225}{19 \times 225} = \frac{900}{4275}
\]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{14326}{4275} + \frac{900}{4275} = \frac{14326 + 900}{4275} = \frac{15226}{4275}
\]

Thus, the total ounces of beverages consumed at the party is:
\[
\frac{15226}{4275}
\]

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            You decide to start a toothbrush collection and you add 7/15 of a new set of toothbrushes to your current collection. Suddenly, a friend gifts you 9 more sets. After grouping everything, you realized you can only fit 26/27 of them in your display case. How many sets of toothbrushes can you fit in your display case?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Addition to Collection:**
   You add \( \frac{7}{15} \) of a new set of toothbrushes to your current collection.

2. **Gift from Friend:**
   Your friend gifts you 9 more sets of toothbrushes.

3. **Total Sets Before Display Case Limitation:**
   The total number of sets you have is:
   \[
   \frac{7}{15} + 9
   \]
   To add these, we need a common denominator. The fraction \( \frac{7}{15} \) can be converted to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
   \[
   9 = \frac{135}{15}
   \]
   So, adding these together:
   \[
   \frac{7}{15} + \frac{135}{15} = \frac{142}{15}
   \]

4. **Fitting in the Display Case:**
   You can fit \( \frac{26}{27} \) of the total sets in your display case. Therefore, the number of sets you can fit is:
   \[
   \frac{26}{27} \times \frac{142}{15}
   \]
   Multiply the numerators and the denominators:
   \[
   \frac{26 \times 142}{27 \times 15} = \frac{3692}{405}
   \]

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   To simplify \( \frac{3692}{405} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3692 and 405. The GCD is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

6. **Converting to a Mixed Number:**
   Divide 3692 by 405:
   \[
   3692 \div 405 \approx 9.11
   \]
   Since we are dealing with sets of toothbrushes, we consider the integer part of the division:
   \[
   9 \text{ sets}
   \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total weight of the backpack after adding the book, we need to add the weight of the empty backpack to the weight of the book.

The weight of the empty backpack is \( \frac{27}{20} \) kilograms.
The weight of the book is \( \frac{1}{6} \) kilograms.

First, we need a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple of 20 and 6 is 60.

Convert \( \frac{27}{20} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60:
\[ \frac{27}{20} = \frac{27 \times 3}{20 \times 3} = \frac{81}{60} \]

Convert \( \frac{1}{6} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60:
\[ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1 \times 10}{6 \times 10} = \frac{10}{60} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{81}{60} + \frac{10}{60} = \frac{81 + 10}{60} = \frac{91}{60} \]

The total weight of the backpack is \( \frac{91}{60} \) kilograms.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total weight of the backpack after adding the heavier book, we need to add the weight of the empty backpack to the weight of the book.

The weight of the empty backpack is \( \frac{27}{20} \) kilograms.
The weight of the book is \( \frac{21}{6} \) kilograms.

First, we need a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple of 20 and 6 is 60.

Convert \( \frac{27}{20} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60:
\[ \frac{27}{20} = \frac{27 \times 3}{20 \times 3} = \frac{81}{60} \]

Convert \( \frac{21}{6} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60:
\[ \frac{21}{6} = \frac{21 \times 10}{6 \times 10} = \frac{210}{60} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{81}{60} + \frac{210}{60} = \frac{81 + 210}{60} = \frac{291}{60} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{291}{60} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 291 and 60 is 3.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{291 \div 3}{60 \div 3} = \frac{97}{20} \]

The total weight of the backpack is \( \frac{97}{20} \) kilograms.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new multiplier of the updated bottle compared to the original one, we need to multiply the previous multiplier \(\frac{25}{22}\) by the new multiplier \(\frac{28}{13}\).

First, we perform the multiplication of the two fractions:
\[
\frac{25}{22} \times \frac{28}{13} = \frac{25 \times 28}{22 \times 13}
\]

Next, we calculate the numerator and the denominator:
\[
25 \times 28 = 700

\[
22 \times 13 = 286
\]

So, the new multiplier is:
\[
\frac{700}{286}

To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 700 and 286. The GCD of 700 and 286 is 14.

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{700 \div 14}{286 \div 14} = \frac{50}{20.42857142857143}

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of food Turtle Tilly has gathered, we need to add all the fractions together. The fractions are:

\[
\frac{25}{9}, \frac{8}{13}, \frac{24}{27}, \frac{21}{26}
\]

First, we need to find a common denominator for these fractions. The denominators are 9, 13, 27, and 26. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 6318.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 6318:

1. \(\frac{25}{9}\):
\[
\frac{25}{9} = \frac{25 \times 702}{9 \times 702} = \frac{17550}{6318}
\]

2. \(\frac{8}{13}\):
\[
\frac{8}{13} = \frac{8 \times 486}{13 \times 486} = \frac{3888}{6318}
\]

3. \(\frac{24}{27}\):
\[
\frac{24}{27} = \frac{24 \times 234}{27 \times 234} = \frac{5616}{6318}

4. \(\frac{21}{26}\):
\[
\frac{21}{26} = \frac{21 \times 243}{26 \times 243} = \frac{5103}{6318}

Now, we add these fractions together:

\[
\frac{17550}{6318} + \frac{3888}{6318} + \frac{5616}{6318} + \frac{5103}{6318} = \frac{17550 + 3888 + 5616 + 5103}{6318} = \frac{32157}{6318}

To simplify \(\frac{32157}{6318}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 32157 and 6318. The GCD is 3.

\[
\frac{32157 \div 3}{6318 \div 3} = \frac{10719}{2106}

We simplify further by finding the GCD of 10719 and 2106, which is 3.

\[
\frac{10719 \div 3}{2106 \div 3} = \frac{3573}{702}

We simplify further by finding the GCD of 3573 and 702, which is 3.

\[
\frac{3573 \div 3}{702 \div 3} = \frac{1191}{234}
\]

We simplify further by finding the GCD of 1191 and 234, which is 3.

\[
\frac{1191 \div 3}{234 \div 3} = \frac{397}{78}

            Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements. 

What does Captain Alfâ€™s final calculation come to? Use these steps and corresponding fractions to find your answer.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the difference in distance to the island:**
   - Distance to the island: \( \frac{17}{2} \) nautical miles
   - Current distance from the island: \( \frac{4}{2} \) nautical miles

   The difference in distance is:
   \[
   \frac{17}{2} - \frac{4}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \text{ nautical miles}
   \]

2. **Adjust for the tide:**
   - Tide adjustment: \( \frac{14}{9} \) nautical miles

   Adding this to the previous distance:
   \[
   \frac{13}{2} + \frac{14}{9}
   \]

   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 9 is 18.

   Convert each fraction:
   \[
   \frac{13}{2} = \frac{13 \times 9}{2 \times 9} = \frac{117}{18}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{14}{9} = \frac{14 \times 2}{9 \times 2} = \frac{28}{18}
   \]

   Now add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{117}{18} + \frac{28}{18} = \frac{145}{18} \text{ nautical miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate fuel requirements:**
   - Fuel efficiency: \( \frac{22}{15} \) nautical miles per gallon

   Multiply the adjusted distance by the fuel efficiency rate:
   \[
   \frac{145}{18} \times \frac{15}{22}
   \]

   Simplify the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{145 \times 15}{18 \times 22} = \frac{2175}{396}
   \]

   Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2175 and 396. The GCD is 3.

   Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
   \[
   \frac{2175 \div 3}{396 \div 3} = \frac{725}{132}
   \]

   Therefore, Captain Alfâ€™s final calculation for the fuel requirement is:
   \[
   \frac{725}{132} \text{ gallons}
   \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many miles the forest ranger patrolled in the afternoon, we start by calculating the distance he patrolled in the morning, which is given as \( \frac{14}{3} \) miles.

Next, we need to find the distance he patrolled in the afternoon, which is \( \frac{2}{18} \) mile less than the morning distance. First, simplify \( \frac{2}{18} \):

\[
\frac{2}{18} = \frac{1}{9}

Now, subtract \( \frac{1}{9} \) from \( \frac{14}{3} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 9 is 9. Convert \( \frac{14}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 9:

\[
\frac{14}{3} = \frac{14 \times 3}{3 \times 3} = \frac{42}{9}
\]

Now, subtract \( \frac{1}{9} \) from \( \frac{42}{9} \):

\[
\frac{42}{9} - \frac{1}{9} = \frac{42 - 1}{9} = \frac{41}{9}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total time Arthur spends practicing the piano each day on the weekend, we need to add the time he practices daily to the additional time he practices on weekends.

Arthur practices daily for \( \frac{20}{21} \) of an hour. On weekends, he practices an additional \( \frac{11}{29} \) of an hour.

First, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 29 is 609.

Convert \( \frac{20}{21} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 609:
\[ \frac{20}{21} = \frac{20 \times 29}{21 \times 29} = \frac{580}{609} \]

Convert \( \frac{11}{29} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 609:
\[ \frac{11}{29} = \frac{11 \times 21}{29 \times 21} = \frac{231}{609} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{580}{609} + \frac{231}{609} = \frac{580 + 231}{609} = \frac{811}{609} \]

Thus, Arthur spends \( \frac{811}{609} \) hours practicing the piano each day on the weekend.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total time Arthur spends on piano practice and music theory each weekend day, we need to add the time he spends on piano practice to the time he spends on music theory.

From the previous calculation, we know Arthur spends \( \frac{811}{609} \) hours on piano practice each weekend day.

Arthur also spends \( \frac{4}{20} \) hours on music theory each weekend day. Simplify \( \frac{4}{20} \):
\[ \frac{4}{20} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Convert \( \frac{1}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 609:
\[ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1 \times 609}{5 \times 609} = \frac{609}{3045} \]

Now, we need to convert \( \frac{811}{609} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 3045:
\[ \frac{811}{609} = \frac{811 \times 5}{609 \times 5} = \frac{4055}{3045} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{4055}{3045} + \frac{609}{3045} = \frac{4055 + 609}{3045} = \frac{4664}{3045} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total time Arthur spends practicing the piano each day on the weekend with the new routine, we need to add the time he practices daily to the additional time he practices on weekends.

Arthur practices daily for \( \frac{20}{21} \) of an hour. On weekends, he now practices an additional \( \frac{11}{24} \) of an hour.

First, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 24 is 168.

Convert \( \frac{20}{21} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 168:
\[ \frac{20}{21} = \frac{20 \times 8}{21 \times 8} = \frac{160}{168} \]

Convert \( \frac{11}{24} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 168:
\[ \frac{11}{24} = \frac{11 \times 7}{24 \times 7} = \frac{77}{168} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{160}{168} + \frac{77}{168} = \frac{160 + 77}{168} = \frac{237}{168} \]

Thus, Arthur spends \( \frac{237}{168} \) hours practicing the piano each day on the weekend. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

How many more or fewer shirts does each sibling now have as compared to before? Calculate the difference using the expression ((18 / 3) - (27 / 19)) and find out the result.

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how many shirts each sibling initially received. Lucas had 18 shirts and divided them equally among his 3 siblings:

\[
\frac{18}{3} = 6
\]

So, each sibling initially received 6 shirts.

Next, Lucas bought 27 more shirts and decided to keep only \(\frac{1}{19}\) of those shirts for each sibling. We need to calculate how many shirts each sibling received from the new batch:

\[
\frac{27}{19}
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of shirts each sibling has now compared to before. This is given by the expression:

\[
\left( \frac{18}{3} \right) - \left( \frac{27}{19} \right)
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
6 - \frac{27}{19}
\]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 6 and \(\frac{27}{19}\) is 19. We convert 6 to a fraction with a denominator of 19:

\[
6 = \frac{6 \times 19}{19} = \frac{114}{19}
\]

Now, we subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{114}{19} - \frac{27}{19} = \frac{114 - 27}{19} = \frac{87}{19}
\]

Finally, we simplify \(\frac{87}{19}\):

\[
\frac{87}{19} = 4.578947368421053
\]

So, each sibling now has approximately 4.58 fewer shirts compared to before.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the total amount of light blue paint the painter initially made by mixing the white and blue paint.

The painter mixed:
- 7 gallons of white paint
- 2/5 gallon of blue paint

Total initial amount of light blue paint:
\[ 7 + \frac{2}{5} \]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 and 5 is 5. So, we convert 7 to a fraction with a denominator of 5:
\[ 7 = \frac{35}{5} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{35}{5} + \frac{2}{5} = \frac{37}{5} \]

So, the total initial amount of light blue paint is:
\[ \frac{37}{5} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, the painter used \( \frac{18}{4} \) gallons of the light blue paint. Simplify \( \frac{18}{4} \):
\[ \frac{18}{4} = \frac{9}{2} \]

Convert \( \frac{9}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 5 to subtract from \( \frac{37}{5} \):
\[ \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9 \times 5}{2 \times 5} = \frac{45}{10} \]

Convert \( \frac{37}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 10:
\[ \frac{37}{5} = \frac{37 \times 2}{5 \times 2} = \frac{74}{10} \]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[ \frac{74}{10} - \frac{45}{10} = \frac{74 - 45}{10} = \frac{29}{10} \]

So, the painter has \( \frac{29}{10} \) gallons of light blue paint left. Converting this to a decimal:
\[ \frac{29}{10} = 2.9 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of hours Jayson spent skating over the two days, we need to add the hours he skated on each day.

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator to make the addition easier.

For the first day:
\[ \frac{24}{7} \]

For the second day:
\[ \frac{30}{20} \]

We can simplify \(\frac{30}{20}\):
\[ \frac{30}{20} = \frac{3}{2} \]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{24}{7}\) and \(\frac{3}{2}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 2 is 14.

Convert \(\frac{24}{7}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 14:
\[ \frac{24}{7} = \frac{24 \times 2}{7 \times 2} = \frac{48}{14} \]

Convert \(\frac{3}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 14:
\[ \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3 \times 7}{2 \times 7} = \frac{21}{14} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{48}{14} + \frac{21}{14} = \frac{48 + 21}{14} = \frac{69}{14} \]

So, the total number of hours Jayson spent skating over the two days is:

            Initially we said Jayson had spent 24/7 hours skating at the roller rink on the first day. However, his friend Jill remembered that they had actually only spent 24/22 hours skating that day. Given this new information, how many hours did Jayson spend roller skating during the first two days including the 30/20 hours on the second day?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of hours Jayson spent skating over the two days with the corrected information, we need to add the hours he skated on each day.

First, let's convert the fractions to a common denominator to make the addition easier.

For the first day:
\[ \frac{24}{22} \]

For the second day:
\[ \frac{30}{20} \]

We can simplify \(\frac{30}{20}\):
\[ \frac{30}{20} = \frac{3}{2} \]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{24}{22}\) and \(\frac{3}{2}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 22 and 2 is 22.

Convert \(\frac{3}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 22:
\[ \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3 \times 11}{2 \times 11} = \frac{33}{22} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{24}{22} + \frac{33}{22} = \frac{24 + 33}{22} = \frac{57}{22} \]

So, the total number of hours Jayson spent skating over the two days is:
\[ \frac{57}{22} \]

            Callie owns a pen business. Last month, she sold 20 pens for every 15 she produced. At the same time, she sold an additional 16 pens for every 22 she put out for sale. 

Meanwhile, she found that for every 22 pens she advertised, 27 were interested customers. For each 23 pens she produced this week, she was able to sell 8. 

What is the result when she multiplies the ratio of last month's sales to production (20/15 + 16/22) and this week's figure for the ratio of interested customers to production (22/27 * 23/8)? Leave your answer as an unsimplified fraction.

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to calculate two ratios and then multiply them together.

First, let's find the ratio of last month's sales to production. This ratio is given by the sum of two fractions:
\[ \frac{20}{15} + \frac{16}{22} \]

We can simplify each fraction individually:
\[ \frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ \frac{16}{22} = \frac{8}{11} \]

Now, we need to add these two fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 11 is 33:
\[ \frac{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 11}{3 \times 11} = \frac{44}{33} \]
\[ \frac{8}{11} = \frac{8 \times 3}{11 \times 3} = \frac{24}{33} \]

Adding these fractions together:
\[ \frac{44}{33} + \frac{24}{33} = \frac{44 + 24}{33} = \frac{68}{33} \]

Next, let's find the ratio of interested customers to production for this week:
\[ \frac{22}{27} \times \frac{23}{8} \]

We multiply these fractions directly:
\[ \frac{22 \times 23}{27 \times 8} = \frac{506}{216} \]

Now, we multiply the two results together:
\[ \frac{68}{33} \times \frac{506}{216} = \frac{68 \times 506}{33 \times 216} = \frac{34408}{7128} \]

Thus, the result when she multiplies the ratio of last month's sales to production and this week's figure for the ratio of interested customers to production is:

            Continuing from the previous problem, Callie decides to adjust her production strategy for next month. She plans on increasing her production by a factor of 6/3 (which is actually doubling her production).

What would be the combined impact on her business of last month's sales ratio (20/15 + 16/22), this week's interest to production ratio (22/27 * 23/8), and her planned production increase (6/3), considering they multiply together? Leave your answer as an unsimplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the combined impact on Callie's business, we need to multiply the three ratios together: last month's sales ratio, this week's interest to production ratio, and her planned production increase.

From the previous problem, we already have:
1. Last month's sales ratio: \(\frac{68}{33}\)
2. This week's interest to production ratio: \(\frac{506}{216}\)

Now, we need to consider her planned production increase, which is a factor of \(\frac{6}{3}\). Simplifying this, we get:
\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

Next, we multiply all three ratios together:
\[ \frac{68}{33} \times \frac{506}{216} \times 2 \]

First, let's multiply the first two ratios:
\[ \frac{68}{33} \times \frac{506}{216} = \frac{68 \times 506}{33 \times 216} = \frac{34408}{7128} \]

Now, we multiply this result by 2:
\[ \frac{34408}{7128} \times 2 = \frac{34408 \times 2}{7128} = \frac{68816}{7128} \]

Thus, the combined impact on her business, considering all factors, is:

\[ \frac{8}{11} = \frac{8 \times 15}{11 \times 15} = \frac{120}{165} \]

Adding these fractions together:
\[ \frac{154}{165} + \frac{120}{165} = \frac{154 + 120}{165} = \frac{274}{165} \]

            Consider a band practice session in which a musician played a song for exactly 30 minutes. After dividing this time equally between 15 songs, how much time did they spend on each song? From this average time per song, the band reduced the time spent on a particular song by 1/17 of an hour. Can you calculate the final duration of that song?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the time spent on each song during the practice session. The total time spent is 30 minutes, and this time is divided equally among 15 songs.

To find the time spent on each song, we divide the total time by the number of songs:
\[
\text{Time per song} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ songs}} = 2 \text{ minutes per song}
\]

Next, we need to convert the time per song into hours since the reduction is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[
2 \text{ minutes} = \frac{2}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours}
\]

The band reduced the time spent on a particular song by \(\frac{1}{17}\) of an hour. We need to subtract this reduction from the original time per song:
\[
\text{Final duration} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours} - \frac{1}{17} \text{ hours}
\]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 30 and 17 is 510. We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{30} = \frac{17}{510}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{17} = \frac{30}{510}
\]

Now we subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{17}{510} - \frac{30}{510} = \frac{17 - 30}{510} = \frac{-13}{510} = -\frac{13}{510}
\]

Since we are dealing with time, we should consider the absolute value:
\[
\left| -\frac{13}{510} \right| = \frac{13}{510}
\]

Simplifying \(\frac{13}{510}\):
\[
\frac{13}{510} = \frac{1}{39.23} \approx 0.0255 \text{ hours}
\]

Converting this back to minutes:
\[
0.0255 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \approx 1.53 \text{ minutes}
\]

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's convert the hours Josh rode the scooter into a fraction. Josh rode the scooter for 18 hours and an additional \( \frac{1}{12} \) of an hour. 

To combine these, we need to express 18 as a fraction with a common denominator of 12:
\[ 18 = \frac{18 \times 12}{12} = \frac{216}{12} \]

Adding the additional \( \frac{1}{12} \) hour:
\[ \frac{216}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{216 + 1}{12} = \frac{217}{12} \]

Next, we consider the time Jack rode the scooter, which is \( \frac{7}{17} \) of an hour.

To find the total time both Josh and Jack rode the scooters, we need to add \( \frac{217}{12} \) and \( \frac{7}{17} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 17 is 204.

Convert both fractions to have the denominator of 204:
\[ \frac{217}{12} = \frac{217 \times 17}{12 \times 17} = \frac{3689}{204} \]
\[ \frac{7}{17} = \frac{7 \times 12}{17 \times 12} = \frac{84}{204} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{3689}{204} + \frac{84}{204} = \frac{3689 + 84}{204} = \frac{3773}{204} \]

The fraction \( \frac{3773}{204} \) is already in its simplest form because 3773 and 204 have no common factors other than 1.

First, we need a common denominator for \( \frac{3773}{204} \) and \( \frac{1}{21} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 204 and 21 is 1428.

Convert both fractions to have the denominator of 1428:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total fraction of the lamps in the store, we need to add the fractions of each type of lamp together. The fractions given are:

- Floor lamps: \(\frac{4}{26}\)
- Desk lamps: \(\frac{15}{11}\)
- Table lamps: \(\frac{23}{28}\)
- Decorative lamps: \(\frac{8}{19}\)

First, we simplify the fractions where possible:

\[
\frac{4}{26} = \frac{2}{13}
\]

Next, we add the fractions together. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 13, 11, 28, and 19 is 7604. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{2}{13} = \frac{2 \times 584}{13 \times 584} = \frac{1168}{7604}
\]

\[
\frac{15}{11} = \frac{15 \times 691}{11 \times 691} = \frac{10365}{7604}

\[
\frac{23}{28} = \frac{23 \times 271}{28 \times 271} = \frac{6233}{7604}

\[
\frac{8}{19} = \frac{8 \times 400}{19 \times 400} = \frac{3200}{7604}

Now, we add these fractions together:

\[
\frac{1168}{7604} + \frac{10365}{7604} + \frac{6233}{7604} + \frac{3200}{7604} = \frac{1168 + 10365 + 6233 + 3200}{7604} = \frac{20966}{7604}

We simplify the resulting fraction:

\[
\frac{20966}{7604} = \frac{20966 \div 2}{7604 \div 2} = \frac{10483}{3802}
\]

Since 10483 and 3802 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to add the lengths of the two kite strings.

The lengths of the kite strings are:
\[ \frac{26}{19} \text{ meters} \]
\[ \frac{7}{11} \text{ meters} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 19 and 11 is 209.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 209:
\[ \frac{26}{19} = \frac{26 \times 11}{19 \times 11} = \frac{286}{209} \]
\[ \frac{7}{11} = \frac{7 \times 19}{11 \times 19} = \frac{133}{209} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{286}{209} + \frac{133}{209} = \frac{286 + 133}{209} = \frac{419}{209} \]

Next, Oliver decides to use only \(\frac{5}{8}\) of this combined string. We need to multiply \(\frac{419}{209}\) by \(\frac{5}{8}\):
\[ \frac{419}{209} \times \frac{5}{8} = \frac{419 \times 5}{209 \times 8} = \frac{2095}{1672} \]

            In a snow fight, Mike threw 9/19 of his snowballs and his friend, John threw 6/8 of his snowballs. After a while, Mike found 4 more snowballs to throw.

The question is, if 'u' represents the number of snowballs thrown by both Mike and John and 'j' is the total number of snowballs Mike had after finding more, how many snowballs did Mike have in total?

Solve the following equations to find the variable 'j':

u = 9/19 + 6/8

j = u + 4/1

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to find the total number of snowballs Mike had after finding more. We will solve the given equations step by step.

First, let's solve for \( u \):

\[ u = \frac{9}{19} + \frac{6}{8} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 19 and 8 is 152.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 152:

\[ \frac{9}{19} = \frac{9 \times 8}{19 \times 8} = \frac{72}{152} \]
\[ \frac{6}{8} = \frac{6 \times 19}{8 \times 19} = \frac{114}{152} \]

Now add the fractions:

\[ u = \frac{72}{152} + \frac{114}{152} = \frac{72 + 114}{152} = \frac{186}{152} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{186}{152} = \frac{93}{76} \]

So, \( u = \frac{93}{76} \).

Next, we need to find \( j \):

\[ j = u + \frac{4}{1} \]

Substitute \( u \) with \( \frac{93}{76} \):

\[ j = \frac{93}{76} + \frac{4}{1} \]

Convert \( \frac{4}{1} \) to have a denominator of 76:

\[ \frac{4}{1} = \frac{4 \times 76}{1 \times 76} = \frac{304}{76} \]

Now add the fractions:

\[ j = \frac{93}{76} + \frac{304}{76} = \frac{93 + 304}{76} = \frac{397}{76} \]

So, the total number of snowballs Mike had after finding more is:

            Continuing from the initial problem, suppose that instead of finding 4 more snowballs, Mike now finds 5 more snowballs instead.

Now, if 'u' represents the number of snowballs thrown by both Mike and John initially, and 'j' is the total number of snowballs Mike has after finding more, how many snowballs does Mike have in total now?

Solve the following equations to find the updated value of 'j':

u = 9/19 + 6/8

j = u + 5/1
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the updated problem, we will follow similar steps as before but with the new value of 5 more snowballs found by Mike.

First, let's solve for \( u \):

\[ u = \frac{9}{19} + \frac{6}{8} \]

We already found the common denominator and converted the fractions in the previous solution:

\[ \frac{9}{19} = \frac{72}{152} \]
\[ \frac{6}{8} = \frac{114}{152} \]

Adding these fractions:

\[ u = \frac{72}{152} + \frac{114}{152} = \frac{186}{152} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{186}{152} = \frac{93}{76} \]

So, \( u = \frac{93}{76} \).

Next, we need to find \( j \):

\[ j = u + \frac{5}{1} \]

Substitute \( u \) with \( \frac{93}{76} \):

\[ j = \frac{93}{76} + \frac{5}{1} \]

Convert \( \frac{5}{1} \) to have a denominator of 76:

\[ \frac{5}{1} = \frac{5 \times 76}{1 \times 76} = \frac{380}{76} \]

Now add the fractions:

\[ j = \frac{93}{76} + \frac{380}{76} = \frac{93 + 380}{76} = \frac{473}{76} \]

So, the total number of snowballs Mike has after finding 5 more is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total amount of chocolate both workers can package in one minute, we need to find their individual rates and then sum them up.

First, let's find the rate for the first worker:
- The first worker packages 26 pieces of chocolate in 18 minutes.
- The rate of the first worker is \( \frac{26 \text{ pieces}}{18 \text{ minutes}} \).

To find the rate per minute, we divide 26 by 18:
\[ \frac{26}{18} = \frac{13}{9} \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, let's find the rate for the second worker:
- The second worker packages 15 pieces of chocolate in 15 minutes.
- The rate of the second worker is \( \frac{15 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ minutes}} \).

To find the rate per minute, we divide 15 by 15:
\[ \frac{15}{15} = 1 \text{ piece per minute} \]

Now, we sum the rates of both workers to find the total amount of chocolate they can package in one minute:

            In our previous scenario at the chocolate factory, one worker was packaging 26 pieces of chocolate in 18 minutes, and another worker was packaging 15 pieces of chocolate every 15 minutes. 

Now let's consider a small change: the second worker's speed has slightly decreased, and they are now able to package only 14 pieces of chocolate every 15 minutes instead of 15.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the new total amount of chocolate both workers can package in one minute, we need to find their individual rates with the updated information and then sum them up.

First, let's find the rate for the first worker (unchanged):
- The first worker packages 26 pieces of chocolate in 18 minutes.
- The rate of the first worker is \( \frac{26 \text{ pieces}}{18 \text{ minutes}} \).

To find the rate per minute, we divide 26 by 18:
\[ \frac{26}{18} = \frac{13}{9} \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, let's find the new rate for the second worker:
- The second worker now packages 14 pieces of chocolate in 15 minutes.
- The rate of the second worker is \( \frac{14 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ minutes}} \).

To find the rate per minute, we divide 14 by 15:
\[ \frac{14}{15} \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we sum the rates of both workers to find the total amount of chocolate they can package in one minute:
\[ \frac{13}{9} + \frac{14}{15} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 15 is 45. We convert each fraction:

\[ \frac{13}{9} = \frac{13 \times 5}{9 \times 5} = \frac{65}{45} \]
\[ \frac{14}{15} = \frac{14 \times 3}{15 \times 3} = \frac{42}{45} \]

Now, we add the fractions:

The first recipe requires (27 / 3) cups flour and (11 / 7) cups sugar. She determines the ratio of flour to sugar by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar. She then subtracts (21 / 26) from this ratio because that's how many cups of sugar her friend says makes the cookies too sweet. After that, she adds (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio to see how many total cups of flour she will need. How many cups of flour will she have in the end?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the amount of flour and sugar in the first recipe:
   - Flour: \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups
   - Sugar: \( \frac{11}{7} \) cups

2. Determine the ratio of flour to sugar:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Flour}}{\text{Sugar}} = \frac{9}{\frac{11}{7}} = 9 \times \frac{7}{11} = \frac{63}{11}
   \]

3. Subtract \( \frac{21}{26} \) from this ratio:
   \[
   \frac{63}{11} - \frac{21}{26}
   \]

   To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 11 and 26 is 286.

   Convert each fraction to have the common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{63}{11} = \frac{63 \times 26}{11 \times 26} = \frac{1638}{286}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{21}{26} = \frac{21 \times 11}{26 \times 11} = \frac{231}{286}
   \]

   Now subtract the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{1638}{286} - \frac{231}{286} = \frac{1407}{286}
   \]

4. Simplify the fraction \( \frac{1407}{286} \):
   \[
   \frac{1407 \div 13}{286 \div 13} = \frac{108.23}{22} \approx 4.92
   \]

5. Add \( \frac{22}{9} \) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio:
   \[
   4.92 + \frac{22}{9}
   \]

   Convert \( \frac{22}{9} \) to a decimal:
   \[
   \frac{22}{9} \approx 2.44
   \]

   Add the two values:
   \[
   4.92 + 2.44 = 7.36
   \]

            There are 26/13 chickens in one farm and 9/16 chickens in another farm. Farmer John calculated the difference between the number of chickens in the two farms. After a week, the number of chickens multiplied by 19/21 due to new chickens born. How many chickens are there now in Farmer John's farm?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's calculate the number of chickens in each farm.

For the first farm:
\[
\frac{26}{13} = 2 \text{ chickens}
\]

For the second farm:
\[
\frac{9}{16} \text{ chickens}
\]

Next, we find the difference between the number of chickens in the two farms:
\[
2 - \frac{9}{16}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 2 (which is \(\frac{32}{16}\)) and \(\frac{9}{16}\) is 16:
\[
2 = \frac{32}{16}
\]

So, the difference is:
\[
\frac{32}{16} - \frac{9}{16} = \frac{23}{16} \text{ chickens}
\]

After a week, the number of chickens multiplied by \(\frac{19}{21}\):
\[
\frac{23}{16} \times \frac{19}{21} = \frac{23 \times 19}{16 \times 21} = \frac{437}{336}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{437}{336}\), we check for common factors. Since 437 and 336 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

            Farmer John was excited to find that after one week, not only did the number of chickens multiplied by 19/21 due to new chickens being born, but also an additional chicken (representing 28/28) wandered into his farm. How many chickens does Farmer John have on his farm now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously calculated that the number of chickens after multiplying by \(\frac{19}{21}\) was \(\frac{437}{336}\).

Now, we need to add the additional chicken, which is represented as \(\frac{28}{28}\).

First, let's convert \(\frac{28}{28}\) to a fraction with the same denominator as \(\frac{437}{336}\). We need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 336 and 28 is 336.

\[
\frac{28}{28} = \frac{28 \times 12}{28 \times 12} = \frac{336}{336}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{437}{336} + \frac{336}{336} = \frac{437 + 336}{336} = \frac{773}{336}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total fraction of the tank that the UFO refilled during the two stops, we need to add the fractions from each stop.

First refuel: \(\frac{20}{16}\)
Second refuel: \(\frac{24}{25}\)

First, simplify \(\frac{20}{16}\):
\[
\frac{20}{16} = \frac{5}{4}
\]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{5}{4}\) and \(\frac{24}{25}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 25 is 100.

Convert \(\frac{5}{4}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 100:
\[
\frac{5}{4} = \frac{5 \times 25}{4 \times 25} = \frac{125}{100}

Convert \(\frac{24}{25}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 100:
\[
\frac{24}{25} = \frac{24 \times 4}{25 \times 4} = \frac{96}{100}

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{125}{100} + \frac{96}{100} = \frac{125 + 96}{100} = \frac{221}{100}

Second refuel: \(\frac{24}{25}\)

\[
\frac{30}{16} = \frac{15}{8}
\]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{15}{8}\) and \(\frac{24}{25}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 25 is 200.

Convert \(\frac{15}{8}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 200:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the two fractions \(\frac{24}{27}\) and \(\frac{30}{26}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The denominators are 27 and 26, and their least common multiple (LCM) is 27 * 26 = 702.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

1. Convert \(\frac{24}{27}\):
\[
\frac{24}{27} = \frac{24 \times 26}{27 \times 26} = \frac{624}{702}
\]

2. Convert \(\frac{30}{26}\):
\[
\frac{30}{26} = \frac{30 \times 27}{26 \times 27} = \frac{810}{702}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{624}{702} + \frac{810}{702} = \frac{624 + 810}{702} = \frac{1434}{702}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{1434}{702}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1434 and 702. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(1434 \div 702 = 2\) with a remainder of \(1434 - 2 \times 702 = 30\)
2. \(702 \div 30 = 23\) with a remainder of \(702 - 23 \times 30 = 12\)
3. \(30 \div 12 = 2\) with a remainder of \(30 - 2 \times 12 = 6\)
4. \(12 \div 6 = 2\) with a remainder of \(12 - 2 \times 6 = 0\)

The GCD is 6. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 6:
\[
\frac{1434 \div 6}{702 \div 6} = \frac{239}{117}
\]

Thus, the simplified sum of the fractions is:

\frac{312}{702} + \frac{810}{702} = \frac{312 + 810}{702} = \frac{1122}{702}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{1122}{702}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1122 and 702. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(1122 \div 702 = 1\) with a remainder of \(1122 - 1 \times 702 = 420\)
2. \(702 \div 420 = 1\) with a remainder of \(702 - 1 \times 420 = 282\)
3. \(420 \div 282 = 1\) with a remainder of \(420 - 1 \times 282 = 138\)
4. \(282 \div 138 = 2\) with a remainder of \(282 - 2 \times 138 = 6\)
5. \(138 \div 6 = 23\) with a remainder of \(138 - 23 \times 6 = 0\)

The GCD is 6. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 6:
\[
\frac{1122 \div 6}{702 \div 6} = \frac{187}{117}
\]

Thus, the simplified sum of the fractions is:
\[
\frac{187}{117}
\]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of bananas Kiki ate, we need to add the amount she ate in the morning to the amount she ate in the afternoon.

Kiki ate \( \frac{11}{6} \) bananas in the morning and \( \frac{11}{6} \) bananas in the afternoon.

To find the total, we add these two fractions:
\[
\frac{11}{6} + \frac{11}{6}
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can simply add the numerators:
\[
\frac{11 + 11}{6} = \frac{22}{6}
\]

Thus, Kiki ate \( \frac{22}{6} \) bananas in total.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Jaden is a dairy farmer who milks his cows twice a day. In the morning, his cows give him 26/14 gallons of milk per cow, and in the evening, they give 28/20 gallons of milk per cow. If he multiplies these two fractions together, how much milk is he getting from one cow in one day?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much milk Jaden gets from one cow in one day, we need to multiply the two fractions representing the morning and evening milk yields.

First, let's simplify the fractions if possible:
- The morning yield is \( \frac{26}{14} \). We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
  \[
  \frac{26}{14} = \frac{26 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{13}{7}
  \]

- The evening yield is \( \frac{28}{20} \). We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
  \[
  \frac{28}{20} = \frac{28 \div 4}{20 \div 4} = \frac{7}{5}
  \]

Now, we multiply the simplified fractions:
\[
\frac{13}{7} \times \frac{7}{5}
\]

When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
\[
\frac{13 \times 7}{7 \times 5} = \frac{91}{35}
\]

Next, we simplify \( \frac{91}{35} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7:
\[
\frac{91}{35} = \frac{91 \div 7}{35 \div 7} = \frac{13}{5}
\]

Thus, Jaden gets \( \frac{13}{5} \) gallons of milk from one cow in one day.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Following the previous problem, let's consider that Jaden has made some changes on his farm that affected the milk production in the evening. Now, his cows give him 28/10 gallons of milk per cow in the evening instead of the previous 28/20 gallons. If we still take the morning milk production as 26/14 gallons per cow, how much milk is he getting from one cow in one day now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the new total amount of milk Jaden gets from one cow in one day, we need to multiply the morning and evening milk yields.

First, let's simplify the fractions if possible:
- The morning yield is \( \frac{26}{14} \). We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
  \[
  \frac{26}{14} = \frac{26 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{13}{7}
  \]

- The new evening yield is \( \frac{28}{10} \). We can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
  \[
  \frac{28}{10} = \frac{28 \div 2}{10 \div 2} = \frac{14}{5}
  \]

Now, we multiply the simplified fractions:
\[
\frac{13}{7} \times \frac{14}{5}
\]

When multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
\[
\frac{13 \times 14}{7 \times 5} = \frac{182}{35}
\]

Next, we simplify \( \frac{182}{35} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7:
\[
\frac{182}{35} = \frac{182 \div 7}{35 \div 7} = \frac{26}{5}
\]

Thus, Jaden gets \( \frac{26}{5} \) gallons of milk from one cow in one day.
