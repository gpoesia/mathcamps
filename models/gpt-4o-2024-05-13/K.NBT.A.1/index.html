        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of young dolphins, we need to subtract the number of mature dolphins from the total number of dolphins.

The total number of dolphins is 10.
The number of mature dolphins is 3.

So, the number of young dolphins is:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many candies Sarah's friend gave her, we need to find the difference between the total number of candies Sarah had after receiving the additional candies and the number of candies she originally had.

Sarah originally had 4 candies.
After receiving more candies, she had a total of 10 candies.

We can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Original candies} + \text{Candies given by friend} = \text{Total candies} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 4 + \text{Candies given by friend} = 10 \]

To find the number of candies given by her friend, we subtract the original number of candies from the total number of candies:
\[ \text{Candies given by friend} = 10 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Candies given by friend} = 6 \]

According to the problem, if Barry finds 10 more honey jars, he will have a total of 16 honey jars. This can be expressed with the equation:

To find the value of \( x \), we need to solve this equation by isolating \( x \). We do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x + 10 - 10 = 16 - 10 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Barry the bear originally had 6 honey jars.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much additional snow was added to the bottom half of the snowman, we need to find the difference between the required amount of snow and the initial amount of snow used.

The required amount of snow for the bottom half is 10 lbs.
The initial amount of snow used is 9 lbs.

The additional snow added is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Additional snow} = \text{Required amount} - \text{Initial amount} \]

Let \( x \) be the wind speed in the morning. According to the problem, the afternoon wind speed is the morning wind speed plus the increase:

To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ x + 10 - 10 = 14 - 10 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pillows John bought, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the number of pillows John bought.

Initially, John had 10 pillows. After buying \( x \) more pillows, he has a total of 11 pillows. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 10 + x = 11 \]

To solve for \( x \), we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 11 - 10 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

So, John bought 1 pillow.

We can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Number of crayons before} + 1 = 10 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation to find the number of crayons you had before:
\[ \text{Number of crayons before} = 10 - 1 \]

Let \( x \) represent the number of additional colors. Then we have:

\[ x = 2 \]

So, 2 additional colors were added to the 8 base colors.

Let \( x \) be the number of clowns that joined in the afternoon.

Let \( x \) be the number of dolphins the trainer acquired. We can set up the following equation:
\[ 9 + x = 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 10 - 9 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

Therefore, the trainer acquired 1 additional dolphin.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many more flowers the butterfly needs to visit in the afternoon, we start with the total daily quota of flowers, which is 10. The butterfly has already visited 6 flowers in the morning.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 6 + r = 10 \]

To find \( r \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ r = 10 - 6 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, the butterfly needs to visit 4 more flowers in the afternoon to meet her daily quota.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many toy cars Eli found that were initially buried in the sandbox, we need to subtract the number of toy cars he initially saw from the total number of toy cars he found.

Eli initially saw 10 toy cars. He found a total of 11 toy cars in the sandbox.

The number of toy cars that were buried and not initially seen is:
\[ 11 - 10 = 1 \]
