1. John initially has 2 tomatoes.
2. He found the same amount of tomatoes in his garden, which means he found 2 more tomatoes.
3. Later, he picked 7 more tomatoes from his neighbor's garden.

To find the total number of tomatoes John has now, we add all the tomatoes together:

\[ 2 \text{ (initial tomatoes)} + 2 \text{ (found in his garden)} + 7 \text{ (picked from neighbor's garden)} \]

\[ 2 + 2 + 7 = 11 \]

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the total number of apples John ate. He ate 3 apples initially and then 5 more apples. 

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

So, John ate 8 apples in total.

Next, we add the number of grapes he ate to the total number of apples. He ate 5 grapes.

\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of fruit John ate is 13.

Total number of dinosaur exhibits = Number of T-Rex exhibits + Number of Brachiosaurus exhibits

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, the farmer has 1 apple tree.
2. He plants 2 more apple trees.
3. Additionally, he plants a number of trees equivalent to the initial number of trees, which is 1.

So, the total number of trees planted is:
\[ 1 \text{ (initial tree)} + 2 \text{ (new trees)} + 1 \text{ (equivalent to the initial number)} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of apple trees in the orchard now is 4.

How many apple trees does the farmer have in his orchard now?

1. Initially, the farmer has 1 apple tree.
2. He plants 3 more apple trees.
3. Additionally, he plants a number of trees equivalent to the initial number of trees, which is 1.

So, the total number of trees planted is:
\[ 1 \text{ (initial tree)} + 3 \text{ (new trees)} + 1 \text{ (equivalent to the initial number)} \]

1. The wizard casts the spell twice.

2. In the second round, the wizard cast another 2 spells, each summoning 4 mystical eagles:

To find the total number of mystical eagles summoned, we add the eagles from both rounds:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of UFOs Tom has seen with the new information, we need to add the number of UFOs he saw on each day.

1. On Monday, Tom saw 1 UFO.
2. On Tuesday, he saw 5 more UFOs.
3. On Wednesday, he spotted another 7 UFOs.

Now, we sum these amounts:
\[ 1 + 5 + 7 \]

First, add the UFOs seen on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 1 + 5 = 6 \]

Next, add the UFOs seen on Wednesday:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of UFOs Tom has seen is:
