        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many fish will be leftover after the shark eats, we need to subtract the number of fish the shark consumes from the total number of fish in the tank.

Initially, there are 535 fish in the tank. The shark eats 461 fish in one sitting.

Let's perform the subtraction:
\[ 535 - 461 = 74 \]

So, after the shark eats 461 fish, there will be 74 fish left in the tank.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many cookies the baker has left after distributing them equally among 186 orphanages, we need to perform a division and find the remainder.

First, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of orphanages:
\[ 928 \div 186 \]

Performing the division:
\[ 928 \div 186 \approx 4 \text{ remainder } 184 \]

To verify, we multiply the quotient by the divisor and add the remainder:
\[ 186 \times 4 = 744 \]
\[ 928 - 744 = 184 \]

Thus, the remainder is 184, which means the baker has 184 cookies left after distributing them equally among the 186 orphanages.

1. Calculate how many creatures the wizard can summon with 932 stones.
2. Determine the total number of stones used to summon these creatures.
3. Subtract the total number of stones used from the initial number of stones.

First, we calculate the number of creatures the wizard can summon:
\[ \text{Number of creatures} = \left\lfloor \frac{932}{193} \right\rfloor \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{932}{193} \approx 4.83 \]

Since the wizard can only summon whole creatures, we take the floor value:

Next, we calculate the total number of stones used to summon 4 creatures:
\[ \text{Total stones used} = 4 \times 193 = 772 \]

1. Calculate how many creatures the wizard can summon with 932 stones using the correct requirement.

3. Subtract the total number of stones used from the initial number of stones.

First, we calculate the number of creatures the wizard can summon:

\[ \frac{660}{335} \approx 1.9701 \]

Since we can only use whole tiles, the builder can use 1 full tile.

2. Calculate the area covered by the full tiles:
\[ \text{Area covered by full tiles} = 1 \times 335 \text{ square feet} = 335 \text{ square feet} \]

3. Calculate the remaining area to be covered by the last tile:

            A crayon factory has the capacity to make 994 crayons in one operation. However, each box only holds 425 crayons. If they operate at full capacity, how many crayons will be left out of the boxes after the operation?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many crayons will be left out of the boxes after the operation, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate how many full boxes of crayons can be made.
2. Determine how many crayons will be left after filling the boxes.

First, we divide the total number of crayons by the capacity of each box:
\[ \frac{994 \text{ crayons}}{425 \text{ crayons/box}} \]

Performing the division:
\[ 994 \div 425 \approx 2.338 \]

Since we can only have whole boxes, we take the integer part of the division, which is 2. This means we can fill 2 full boxes.

Next, we calculate the number of crayons used to fill these 2 boxes:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times 425 \text{ crayons/box} = 850 \text{ crayons} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of crayons used from the total number of crayons to find the remainder:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many people will view the event on the final night for the neighboring town's astronomy club, we need to divide the total number of members by the number of people the telescope can handle each night and find the remainder.

First, we perform the division:
\[ 593 \div 228 \]

Using integer division:
\[ 593 \div 228 \approx 2 \]
This means 2 full nights of viewing, with each night accommodating 228 people.

Next, we calculate the total number of people who can view the event in these 2 nights:
\[ 2 \times 228 = 456 \]

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of members to find out how many people will be left for the final night:
\[ 593 - 456 = 137 \]

Thus, 137 people will view the event on the final night.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many letters will remain in the last mailbox, we need to find the remainder when 891 letters are divided by the capacity of each mailbox, which is 616 letters.

First, we perform the division:
\[ 891 \div 616 \]

This division gives us:
\[ 891 \div 616 \approx 1.446 \]

The quotient is 1, meaning each mailbox can hold 616 letters, and there will be some letters left over. To find the remainder, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Remainder} = 891 - (616 \times 1) \]

Calculating the product:
\[ 616 \times 1 = 616 \]

Subtracting this from the total number of letters:
\[ 891 - 616 = 275 \]

1. Calculate the total number of flies eaten by the frog.
2. Subtract the total number of flies eaten from the initial number of flies.

Given:
- Initial number of flies: 941
- Number of flies eaten per jump: 258

First, we need to find out how many jumps the frog makes. Since the problem does not specify the number of jumps, we will assume the frog makes one jump.

Number of flies eaten in one jump:
\[ 258 \]

Now, subtract the number of flies eaten from the initial number of flies:
\[ 941 - 258 \]

Perform the subtraction:
\[ 941 - 258 = 683 \]

            A construction company is installing 166 windows on a building. They have determined that one installation team can install 137 windows per day. If all windows are equally distributed amongst teams each day, how many windows will remain for the team to install on the next day?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many windows will remain for the team to install on the next day, we need to find the remainder when 166 windows are divided by 137 windows per day.

First, we perform the division:
\[ 166 \div 137 \approx 1.21 \]

This means that one full day of work will cover 137 windows, and we need to find out how many windows are left after this.

Next, we calculate the remainder:
\[ 166 - 137 = 29 \]

So, after one full day of installing 137 windows, 29 windows will remain for the team to install on the next day.

First, we perform the division:

This means that 474 fits into 999 a total of 2 times. To find the remainder, we calculate:

\]

Since the tailor can only make whole skirts, we take the integer part of the division, which is 2 skirts.

Next, we calculate the total fabric used for 2 skirts:

\[
2 \text{ skirts} \times 160 \text{ meters/skirt} = 320 \text{ meters}

Since the tailor can only make whole skirts, and 0.13125 is less than 1, the tailor cannot make any skirts.

1. Calculate the number of snowmen that can be built with the available snowballs.
2. Determine the total number of snowballs used to build these snowmen.
3. Subtract the total number of snowballs used from the initial number of snowballs to find the leftover snowballs.

First, we calculate the number of snowmen that can be built:
\[ \text{Number of snowmen} = \left\lfloor \frac{804}{184} \right\rfloor \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{804}{184} \approx 4.369 \]

Since we can only build whole snowmen, we take the integer part:
\[ \left\lfloor 4.369 \right\rfloor = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of snowballs used to build 4 snowmen:
\[ \text{Total snowballs used} = 4 \times 184 = 736 \]

Finally, we find the number of leftover snowballs:
\[ \text{Leftover snowballs} = 804 - 736 = 68 \]

Performing the division:
\[ 819 \div 583 \approx 1.404 \]

Since we can only build whole fireplaces, the company can build 1 fireplace. Now, we calculate the number of bricks used for 1 fireplace:

Performing the division:
\[ 486 \div 583 \approx 0.833 \]

Since we can only build whole fireplaces, the company can build 0 full fireplaces with 486 bricks. This means they cannot build any full fireplaces because 486 bricks are less than the 583 bricks required for one fireplace.

First, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages the printer can handle in one go:

Performing the division:
\[ 928 \div 336 \approx 2.76 \]

This means the printer can be filled completely 2 times (since we only consider the whole number part of the division).

Next, we calculate the total number of pages printed in these 2 complete runs:
\[ 2 \times 336 = 672 \]

Now, we subtract this from the total number of pages to find the remainder:

            In the same scenario, suppose the teacher decides to use a different printer that can print 409 pages in one go. After filling this printer a number of times, how many pages will he have left over to print?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pages will be left over after the teacher fills the new printer multiple times, we need to perform a division and find the remainder.

First, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages the new printer can handle in one go:
\[ 928 \div 409 \]

Performing the division:
\[ 928 \div 409 \approx 2.27 \]

This means the printer can be filled completely 2 times (since we only consider the whole number part of the division).

Next, we calculate the total number of pages printed in these 2 complete runs:
\[ 2 \times 409 = 818 \]

Now, we subtract this from the total number of pages to find the remainder:
\[ 928 - 818 = 110 \]

So, after filling the printer completely 2 times, the teacher will have 110 pages left to print.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many sharks are left untagged, we need to find the remainder when 972 sharks are divided into groups of 667.

First, we perform the division:
\[ 972 \div 667 \]

This division gives us:
\[ 972 \div 667 \approx 1.457 \]

Since we are interested in complete groups, we take the integer part of the quotient, which is 1. This means we can form 1 complete group of 667 sharks.

Next, we calculate the number of sharks in this complete group:
\[ 1 \times 667 = 667 \]

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of sharks to find the remainder:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pairs of ice skates will be left over after distributing 976 pairs evenly among 128 boxes, we need to perform a division and find the remainder.

First, we divide the total number of pairs of ice skates by the number of boxes:
\[ 976 \div 128 \]

Performing the division:
\[ 976 \div 128 = 7 \text{ remainder } 80 \]

This means that each box will contain 7 pairs of ice skates, and there will be a remainder of 80 pairs of ice skates.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much power is left over, we need to find the remainder when 506 units of power are divided by 385 units of power.

First, we perform the division:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much power is left over, we need to find the remainder when 506 units of power are divided by 920 units of power.

Since the village's daily consumption (920 units) is greater than the power generated by the windmill (506 units), the village cannot consume a full increment of 920 units. Therefore, the entire 506 units generated by the windmill will be left over because the village cannot consume any complete increment of 920 units.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many students will be on the last school bus, we first need to calculate how many full buses are required and how many students will be left over.

1. Calculate the number of full buses needed:
\[ \text{Number of full buses} = \left\lfloor \frac{530}{144} \right\rfloor \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{530}{144} \approx 3.68 \]

Since we can only have whole buses, we take the integer part:
\[ \left\lfloor 3.68 \right\rfloor = 3 \]

2. Calculate the number of students these 3 full buses can carry:
\[ 3 \text{ buses} \times 144 \text{ students/bus} = 432 \text{ students} \]

3. Determine the number of students left for the last bus:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many players will be left waiting after filling all the matches, we need to find the remainder when 923 players are divided by 383 players per match.

First, we perform the division:

This means that 2 full matches can be formed, as only the integer part of the division is considered.

Next, we calculate the total number of players that can enter these 2 full matches:

First, we perform the division:

\[ 923 \div 499 \approx 1 \text{ (quotient)} \]

Next, we multiply the quotient by the divisor to find out how many cannonballs are distributed:

Since 462 is less than 499, the quotient is 0, meaning each crate will receive 0 cannonballs.

Next, we calculate the remainder:

Since we can only fill whole boxes, we take the integer part of the division, which is 2. This means the gardener can fill 2 full boxes.

Next, we calculate the number of grapes used to fill these 2 boxes:
\[ 2 \times 380 = 760 \]

Finally, we subtract the number of grapes used from the total number of grapes to find the remainder:
\[ 1135 - 760 = 375 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many steps will be left after reaching the last significant place or clue, we need to find the remainder when 236 is divided by 44.

First, we perform the division:
\[ 236 \div 44 \approx 5.36 \]

This means 44 goes into 236 a total of 5 times. To find the exact number of steps used, we multiply:
\[ 44 \times 5 = 220 \]

Next, we subtract this product from the total number of steps to find the remainder:

\[ 355 \div 16 \]

Performing the division:
\[ 355 \div 16 = 22 \text{ remainder } 3 \]

This means that 355 divided by 16 gives a quotient of 22 and a remainder of 3. The quotient represents the number of complete bundles, and the remainder represents the number of carrots left over.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many inches of rain would be left to make the days evenly rainy, we first need to calculate the average rainfall per day over the 29 days.

First, we divide the total rainfall by the number of days:
\[ \text{Average rainfall per day} = \frac{612 \text{ inches}}{29 \text{ days}} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \frac{612}{29} = 21.1 \text{ inches/day} \]

Since the rainfall must be evenly distributed, each day should receive 21.1 inches of rain. However, since rainfall is typically measured in whole numbers, we need to check if there is any remainder when dividing the total rainfall by the number of days.

To find the remainder, we can use the modulo operation:
\[ 612 \mod 29 = 612 - (29 \times 21) \]
\[ 612 - 609 = 3 \]

So, there are 3 inches of rain left over after distributing 21 inches of rain evenly over 29 days.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many liters of milk are left over each day after the dairy farm increases its production to 729 liters, we need to subtract the total capacity of the containers from the total amount of milk produced.

First, we note that the dairy farm now produces 729 liters of milk each day.

Next, we know that the milk is still packaged into 550-liter containers. Therefore, the amount of milk that can be fully packaged each day is 550 liters.

To find the leftover milk, we subtract the capacity of the containers from the total milk produced:
\[ 729 \text{ liters} - 550 \text{ liters} = 179 \text{ liters} \]

1. Calculate the number of dresses she can make with 984 meters of fabric.
2. Determine the total amount of fabric used for these dresses.
3. Subtract the total fabric used from the initial amount of fabric to find the remaining fabric.

First, we calculate the number of dresses she can make:

            The owner of the pizza restaurant decides to make 74 more pizzas tomorrow, bringing the total to 694 pizzas. If they are again distributed into boxes that hold 578 pizzas each, how many pizzas will be left out without a box this time?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pizzas will be left over, we need to find the remainder when 694 pizzas are divided by the box capacity of 578 pizzas.

First, we perform the division:
\[ 694 \div 578 \approx 1.2007 \]

This means that 578 pizzas fit into one full box, and we need to find out how many pizzas are left over.

Next, we calculate the number of pizzas that fit into the full box:
\[ 1 \times 578 = 578 \]

Now, we subtract this from the total number of pizzas to find the remainder:
\[ 694 - 578 = 116 \]

So, there will be 116 pizzas left over that don't fit into a box.

This means that one full storage unit can hold 684 robots, and there will be some robots left over. To find the exact number of robots that remain outside, we calculate the remainder of the division:

            A cloud changes its shape by reducing its water droplets. Initially, there were 516 droplets in the cloud. If the cloud loses water droplets at an equal rate and becomes entirely dry after every 289 droplets, how many droplets will be left when the cloud is dry after the final cycle?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many droplets will be left when the cloud is dry after the final cycle, we need to understand the process of reduction.

Initially, the cloud has 516 droplets. The cloud loses droplets in cycles of 289 droplets each.

First, we calculate how many full cycles of 289 droplets the cloud can go through:
\[ \text{Number of full cycles} = \left\lfloor \frac{516}{289} \right\rfloor \]

Performing the division:
\[ \frac{516}{289} \approx 1.785 \]

Since we are looking for full cycles, we take the integer part:
\[ \left\lfloor 1.785 \right\rfloor = 1 \]

This means the cloud can go through 1 full cycle of losing 289 droplets.

Next, we calculate the number of droplets left after 1 full cycle:
\[ \text{Droplets left} = 516 - (1 \times 289) \]
\[ \text{Droplets left} = 516 - 289 \]
\[ \text{Droplets left} = 227 \]

Therefore, after the final cycle, the cloud will have 227 droplets left.

Since we are looking for full cycles, we take the integer part:
\[ \left\lfloor 0.605 \right\rfloor = 0 \]

This means the cloud cannot go through even one full cycle of losing 289 droplets because 175 is less than 289.

Therefore, the number of droplets left in the cloud will be the initial number of droplets, which is 175.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many snails will be left in the final group when grouped in bunches of 18 snails, we need to find the remainder when 776 is divided by 18.

First, perform the division:
\[ 776 \div 18 \approx 43.111 \]

This means 18 goes into 776 a total of 43 times completely. Now, multiply 18 by 43 to find out how many snails are in these 43 complete groups:
\[ 18 \times 43 = 774 \]

Next, subtract this product from the total number of snails to find the remainder:
\[ 776 - 774 = 2 \]

So, there will be 2 snails left in the final group.

1. Calculate the total number of slices used in the batches.
2. Subtract the total number of slices used from the initial number of slices.

First, let's find out how many batches can be made with 580 slices of bread. Each batch uses 18 slices.

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \left\lfloor \frac{580}{18} \right\rfloor \]

Perform the division:

\[ \frac{580}{18} \approx 32.22 \]

Since we can only make whole batches, we take the integer part, which is 32 batches.

Next, calculate the total number of slices used in 32 batches:

\[ \text{Total slices used} = 32 \times 18 \]

\[ 32 \times 18 = 576 \]

Now, subtract the total slices used from the initial number of slices:

3. Subtract the total fabric used from the initial amount of fabric to find the leftover fabric.

First, we calculate the number of dresses the tailor can make:

Performing the division:
\[ \frac{925}{529} \approx 1.75 \]

Since the tailor can only make whole dresses, we take the floor value:

Next, we calculate the total amount of fabric used for 1 dress:
\[ \text{Total fabric used} = 1 \times 529 \text{ meters} = 529 \text{ meters} \]

2. Calculate how many dresses the tailor can make with the available fabric.
3. Determine the total amount of fabric used for these dresses.
4. Subtract the total fabric used from the initial amount of fabric to find the leftover fabric.

First, we calculate the total amount of fabric the tailor currently has:

Since the tailor can only make whole dresses, we take the floor value:

This means that one full group of 530 tourists can be accommodated, and we need to find out how many tourists are left after this group.

Next, we calculate the number of tourists in one full group:

This means that one full group of 726 tourists can be accommodated, and we need to find out how many tourists are left after this group.

Next, we calculate the number of tourists in one full group:
\[ 1 \times 726 = 726 \]

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of tourists to find the remainder:
\[ 976 - 726 = 250 \]

Therefore, there will be 250 tourists left for the last group of the day.
