We need to find the number of hours worked. Let \( h \) represent the number of hours worked. The equation becomes:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many bracelets are in each multiple, we need to find the distinct multiples of 11 that sum up to 77.

First, let's list the multiples of 11 up to 77:
- 11
- 22
- 33
- 44
- 55
- 66
- 77

Now, we need to find a combination of these multiples that add up to 77. 

One possible way to achieve this is to use the largest multiple first and then see if the remaining sum can be achieved with the smaller multiples.

1. Start with 77 (which is already a multiple of 11):
   - 77 = 77

Since 77 is itself a multiple of 11, we don't need to add any other multiples.

Given:
- Total work required to clean the coral garden = 18 hours (for the entire group)
- Each mermaid works for 9 hours

Let \( n \) be the number of mermaids in the group. The total work done by the group can also be expressed as:

\[ 18 \text{ hours} = n \times 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find \( n \), we solve the equation:

\[ n \times 9 = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 9:

\[ n = \frac{18}{9} \]

\[ n = 2 \]

So, there were 2 mermaids in the group.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of strawberries in one batch, we start by noting that three batches contain a total of 6 strawberries. 

We can set up the equation:
\[ 3 \times \text{number of strawberries per batch} = 6 \]

Let \( x \) represent the number of strawberries in one batch. Then the equation becomes:
\[ 3x = 6 \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{6}{3} \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Thus, there are 2 strawberries in one batch.

- There is 1 bracelet per craftsman displayed in the showroom.

Since each craftsman made 10 bracelets and only 1 bracelet per craftsman is displayed, the number of craftsmen whose work is displayed in the showroom is equal to the number of bracelets displayed.

Therefore, if there is 1 bracelet per craftsman displayed, the number of craftsmen's work displayed in the showroom is simply the number of bracelets displayed.

Given that James has a total of 12 cars, we can set up the following equation to find the number of types of cars:

\[ \text{Number of types} \times 2 = 12 \]

Let \( x \) represent the number of types of toy cars. Then we have:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of doubloons the pirate has found, we need to divide the total weight of the doubloons by the weight of each individual doubloon.

Given:
- Each doubloon weighs 9 grams.
- The total weight of all doubloons is 90 grams.

We can set up the following equation to find the number of doubloons:
\[ \text{Number of doubloons} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Weight of each doubloon}} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Number of doubloons} = \frac{90 \text{ grams}}{9 \text{ grams/doubloon}} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \text{Number of doubloons} = 10 \]

\[ \text{Number of compasses sold per day} \times \text{Number of days} = \text{Total number of compasses sold} \]

Given:
- Number of compasses sold per day = 12
- Total number of compasses sold = 84

Let \( d \) represent the number of days. The equation becomes:

\[ 12d = 84 \]

To find \( d \), we divide both sides of the equation by 12:

\[ d = \frac{84}{12} \]

\[ d = 7 \]

So, it took 7 days to sell 84 compasses.

            A dairy farm produces milk packets. Each day, it produces 3 times the amount of milk packets it produced on the previous day. If on the third day, it produced 33 milk packets, how many milk packets did it produce on the second day?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of milk packets produced on the second day, we need to work backwards from the third day. 

Given that the dairy farm produces 3 times the amount of milk packets each day compared to the previous day, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( P_2 \) be the number of milk packets produced on the second day. According to the problem, the number of milk packets produced on the third day (\( P_3 \)) is 33, and this is 3 times the number of milk packets produced on the second day.

So, we have:
\[ P_3 = 3 \times P_2 \]

Substituting the given value for \( P_3 \):
\[ 33 = 3 \times P_2 \]

To find \( P_2 \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ P_2 = \frac{33}{3} \]
\[ P_2 = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of milk packets produced on the second day is 11.

The total amount of meat is 4 pounds, and one serving size is \(\frac{1}{8}\) of a pound.

            At a birthday party, there is a long string of 5 meters that is used for tying the balloons. If each balloon requires 1 meter of string to be tied, how many balloons can be tied with this string?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many balloons can be tied with the 5-meter string, we need to divide the total length of the string by the length required for each balloon.

Given:
- Total length of the string = 5 meters
- Length of string required per balloon = 1 meter

We perform the division:
\[ \text{Number of balloons} = \frac{\text{Total length of the string}}{\text{Length required per balloon}} = \frac{5 \text{ meters}}{1 \text{ meter/balloon}} = 5 \]

Thus, 5 balloons can be tied with the 5-meter string.

The total number of strawberries is 40, and each friend receives 4 strawberries. We can set up the division as follows:

\[ \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Total strawberries}}{\text{Strawberries per friend}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of friends} = \frac{40}{4} \]

Performing the division:

\[ \text{Number of friends} = 10 \]

The jeweler sold 5 rings for a total of 35 dollars. Therefore, the cost per ring is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per ring} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Number of rings}} = \frac{35 \text{ dollars}}{5 \text{ rings}}
\]

\[
\text{Cost per ring} = 7 \text{ dollars}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the original price of the jacket, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. We know that the discounted price is 1/5th of the original price.

Let the original price be \( d \) dollars.

According to the problem, the discounted price is 1/5th of the original price:
\[ \frac{d}{5} = 6 \]

To find \( d \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ d = 6 \times 5 \]
\[ d = 30 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of giraffes in the zoo, we need to divide the total amount of food consumed by the amount of food each giraffe eats per day.

Given:
- Each giraffe eats 7 pounds of food each day.
- The total amount of food consumed by the giraffes is 28 pounds today.

We can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Number of giraffes} \times 7 \text{ pounds/giraffe} = 28 \text{ pounds} \]

Let \( x \) be the number of giraffes. Then:
\[ 7x = 28 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ x = \frac{28}{7} \]
\[ x = 4 \]
