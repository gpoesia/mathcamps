Julia originally had 1 dollar. After her mother gave her some money, she now has 10 dollars.

Let's denote the amount of money her mother gave her as \( x \).

The equation to represent this situation is:
\[ 1 + x = 10 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 10 - 1 \]
\[ x = 9 \]

So, Julia's mother gave her 9 dollars.

Given:
- Total number of craters after spotting new ones: 10

Let's denote the number of craters before the new ones were spotted as \( x \).

We can set up the equation:
\[ x + 3 = 10 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 10 - 3 \]
\[ x = 7 \]

So, there were 7 craters before the astronomers spotted the 3 new craters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the length of the accessible part of the Sun river, we need to subtract the inaccessible portion from the total length of the river.

Given:
- Total length of the Sun river = 10 miles
- Inaccessible portion = 3 miles

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 10 \text{ miles} - 3 \text{ miles} = 7 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the length of the accessible part of the Sun river is 7 miles.

1. Peter initially had 10 shirts in his closet.
2. After buying a new shirt, he found out he only had one shirt before the purchase.

This implies that the initial count of 10 shirts was incorrect. If he had only one shirt before the purchase, then the number of shirts he had after buying the new shirt would be:

\[ 1 \text{ (initial shirts) } + 1 \text{ (new shirt) } = 2 \text{ shirts} \]

However, the problem states that he initially thought he had 10 shirts, but in reality, he had only one shirt before the purchase. This means he bought:

\[ 10 \text{ (initial incorrect count) } - 1 \text{ (actual initial count) } = 9 \text{ shirts} \]

So, Peter must have bought 9 shirts to correct the count from 1 to 10.

- Total distance of the jump: 10 feet
- Distance due to tail thrust: 9 feet

We calculate the height covered by the dolphin's body strength alone as follows:
\[ \text{Height covered by body strength} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance due to tail thrust} \]
\[ \text{Height covered by body strength} = 10 \text{ feet} - 9 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Height covered by body strength} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

- Number of pine trees = 8

Calculation:
\[ \text{Number of trees that are not pine trees} = \text{Total number of trees} - \text{Number of pine trees} \]
\[ \text{Number of trees that are not pine trees} = 10 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Number of trees that are not pine trees} = 2 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of blue pillows, we start by using the information given:

1. The total number of pillows (blue and green) is 10.
2. The number of green pillows is 6.

We can set up the equation to find the number of blue pillows. Let \( B \) represent the number of blue pillows. According to the problem:

\[ B + 6 = 10 \]

To find \( B \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

\[ B = 10 - 6 \]
\[ B = 4 \]

Thus, there are 4 blue pillows.

Total number of candles: 10
Number of scented candles: 8

Number of unscented candles = Total number of candles - Number of scented candles
Number of unscented candles = 10 - 8

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of seats in the back of the bus, we start with the total number of seats and subtract the number of seats in the front.

The total number of seats in the mini bus is 10.
There is 1 seat in the front.

So, the number of seats in the back is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of seats in the back} = \text{Total number of seats} - \text{Number of seats in the front} \]
\[ \text{Number of seats in the back} = 10 - 1 \]
\[ \text{Number of seats in the back} = 9 \]

To find the number of oranges left to peel, subtract the number of peeled oranges from the total number of oranges:

\[ 10 - 8 = 2 \]

So, you need to peel 2 more oranges.

Sally initially had 10 grapes.
She ate 4 of them.

So, we perform the subtraction:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the number of fluffy and white clouds, we need to subtract the number of dark and stormy clouds from the total number of clouds.

Given:
- Total number of clouds = 10
- Number of dark and stormy clouds = 3

We calculate the number of fluffy and white clouds as follows:
\[ \text{Number of fluffy and white clouds} = \text{Total number of clouds} - \text{Number of dark and stormy clouds} \]
\[ \text{Number of fluffy and white clouds} = 10 - 3 \]
\[ \text{Number of fluffy and white clouds} = 7 \]
