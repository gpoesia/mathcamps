1. Gene initially has 5 beach towels.
2. His younger brother takes 2 of them to the neighborhood swimming pool. So, the number of towels Gene has left is:
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3
   \]
3. Later, his mom gives him an extra 2 towels. Adding these to the towels he has left:
   \[

So, Gene now has 5 beach towels.

1. James initially has 2 helicopters from his birthday party.
2. James buys 1 more helicopter from the toy store.
   - Total helicopters James has now: \( 2 + 1 = 3 \)

3. Rebecca initially has 4 helicopters.
4. Rebecca gives James the same number of helicopters that he already has (which is 3).
   - Number of helicopters Rebecca gives to James: 3

5. Subtract the helicopters Rebecca gave to James from her initial total:
   - \( 4 - 3 = 1 \)

So, Rebecca now has 1 helicopter.

3. Later, 4 other dragons wanted to join the single dragon playing in the field. However, they needed to leave their lair by subtracting the number of dragons already playing in the field. This means they need to subtract 1 from the 4 dragons:

1. The jeweler initially has 4 diamond rings.
2. One of the diamond rings was purchased by a customer.
3. The customer had a 3 gem discount but decided to add 2 gems later.

The key point here is to determine how many rings the jeweler has left after the purchase and adjustments. The adjustments (3 gem discount and adding 2 gems) pertain to the gems on the ring, not the number of rings.

Since one ring was purchased, the jeweler is left with:
\[ 4 - 1 = 3 \]

The adjustments to the gems do not affect the number of rings the jeweler has left.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the net number of rounds Umer won after accounting for his losses. Umer won 5 rounds and lost 4 rounds, so his net wins are:

\[ \text{Net wins for Umer} = 5 - 4 = 1 \]

According to the problem, Sam won twice as many rounds as Umer's net wins. Therefore, we calculate Sam's wins as follows:

\[ \text{Sam's wins} = 2 \times (\text{Umer's net wins}) = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the total number of ruby necklaces Princess Anne had after receiving one more for her birthday. Initially, she had 3 ruby necklaces, and she received 1 more:

\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Next, Princess Anne decided to gift 2 of her necklaces to her best friend, Princess Maria. Therefore, we subtract the 2 gifted necklaces from her total:

\[ 4 - 2 = 2 \]

So, Princess Anne has 2 ruby necklaces left.

The total number of lettuce leaves is 5.
The number of lettuce leaves the snail has already eaten is 4.

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 5 - 4 = 1 \]

So, the snail has 1 lettuce leaf left to eat.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Initially, George has 2 keys left after losing his house key. He then decides to make 3 copies of his house key.

Calculation:
\[ 2 \text{ (remaining keys)} + 3 \text{ (new copies)} = 5 \]

            Let's consider a slightly different scenario. Initially, George had 5 keys instead of 3: 1 for his car, 1 for his office, 2 for his house and 1 for his storage unit. If he unfortunately still loses one for his house, how many keys would he have left now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Initially, George has 5 keys:
- 1 for his car
- 1 for his office
- 2 for his house
- 1 for his storage unit

If he loses one of the keys for his house, we subtract 1 key from the total number of keys he has.

Calculation:
\[ 5 - 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, George would have 4 keys left.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the adjustments Jacob made to his watch step by step:

1. Initially, Jacob set his watch 2 hours ahead.
2. After waking up, he adjusted it 3 more hours ahead.

So, the total time ahead at this point is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

3. Later, Jacob realized his watch was running too fast and set it 4 hours backward.

So, the final adjustment is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} - 4 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, the final time difference on his watch from the actual time is 1 hour ahead.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry initially collected 4 bananas.
2. He accidentally dropped 2 bananas, so he has \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) bananas left.
3. Later, he found 3 more bananas, so he now has \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) bananas.
4. Unfortunately, Larry loses 3 bananas when he climbs a tree.

To find the total number of bananas Larry has left now, we subtract the bananas he lost while climbing the tree from the bananas he had:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

   After losing 3 crayons, Billy has 2 orange crayons left.

3. His friend gave him 1 more orange crayon. So, we add 1 to the 2 crayons he has:

            After counting how many erasers Johnny has, his classmate Vanessa is curious to compare her collection with his. Vanessa starts with 5 purple erasers. If she gave away as many erasers as Johnny's total count, how many erasers will Vanessa have left?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's determine how many erasers Vanessa will have left after giving away some of her erasers.

1. Vanessa starts with 5 purple erasers.
2. Johnny has a total of 4 erasers.
3. Vanessa gives away 4 erasers (the same number as Johnny's total count).

To find out how many erasers Vanessa has left, we subtract the number of erasers she gave away from her initial count:
\[
5 - 4 = 1
\]

Therefore, Vanessa will have 1 eraser left.

1. Johnny starts the day with 1 pink eraser.
2. In the morning, a friend gives him another pink eraser. So, we add this to his initial count:

3. In the afternoon, his teacher gives him yet another eraser. Adding this to his current count:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total spins from the original position, we need to consider the net effect of the rotations.

1. The compass starts pointing north.
2. It makes 3 complete rotations in one direction. Each complete rotation brings it back to the original position, so after 3 rotations, it is still pointing north.
3. Then, it is spun back by 1 rotation in the same direction. This means it is rotated an additional 1 rotation in the same direction as the initial 3 rotations.

So, the total number of rotations is:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Since each complete rotation brings the compass back to the original position, after 4 rotations, the compass is still pointing north.

So, the total number of headlights initially is:
\[ 2 \text{ (front headlights)} + 2 \text{ (back headlights)} = 4 \text{ headlights} \]

After going off-road, 3 of the headlights were damaged beyond repair. Therefore, the number of working headlights left is:
\[ 4 \text{ (total headlights)} - 3 \text{ (damaged headlights)} = 1 \text{ working headlight} \]

Initially:

Total number of giraffes initially = 1 + 3 = 4

Number of baby giraffes that wander off = 3

Number of giraffes left in the backyard = Total number of giraffes initially - Number of baby giraffes that wander off
Number of giraffes left in the backyard = 4 - 3
