        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the product of \(\frac{29}{2}\) and \(\frac{19}{28}\), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{29}{2} \times \frac{19}{28} = \frac{29 \times 19}{2 \times 28}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
29 \times 19 = 551
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \times 28 = 56
\]

So, the product is:

\[
\frac{551}{56}
\]

To check if this fraction can be simplified, we need to determine if there are any common factors between 551 and 56. 

The prime factorization of 551 is:
\[
551 = 19 \times 29
\]

The prime factorization of 56 is:
\[
56 = 2^3 \times 7
\]

Since there are no common factors between 551 and 56, the fraction \(\frac{551}{56}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we already found the product of \(\frac{29}{2}\) and \(\frac{19}{28}\) to be \(\frac{551}{56}\).

Next, we need to multiply this result by \(\frac{8}{28}\):

\[
\frac{551}{56} \times \frac{8}{28} = \frac{551 \times 8}{56 \times 28}
\]

First, calculate the new numerator:

\[
551 \times 8 = 4408
\]

Next, calculate the new denominator:

\[
56 \times 28 = 1568
\]

So, the product is:

\[
\frac{4408}{1568}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4408 and 1568. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 4408 by 1568 and find the remainder:
\[
4408 \div 1568 \approx 2.81 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
4408 - 2 \times 1568 = 4408 - 3136 = 1272
\]

2. Now, divide 1568 by 1272 and find the remainder:
\[
1568 \div 1272 \approx 1.23 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
1568 - 1 \times 1272 = 1568 - 1272 = 296
\]

3. Next, divide 1272 by 296 and find the remainder:
\[
1272 \div 296 \approx 4.29 \quad \text{(integer part is 4)}
\]
\[
1272 - 4 \times 296 = 1272 - 1184 = 88
\]

4. Now, divide 296 by 88 and find the remainder:
\[
296 \div 88 \approx 3.36 \quad \text{(integer part is 3)}
\]
\[
296 - 3 \times 88 = 296 - 264 = 32
\]

5. Next, divide 88 by 32 and find the remainder:
\[
88 \div 32 \approx 2.75 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
88 - 2 \times 32 = 88 - 64 = 24
\]

6. Now, divide 32 by 24 and find the remainder:
\[
32 \div 24 \approx 1.33 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
32 - 1 \times 24 = 32 - 24 = 8
\]

7. Finally, divide 24 by 8 and find the remainder:
\[
24 \div 8 = 3 \quad \text{(integer part is 3)}
\]
\[
24 - 3 \times 8 = 24 - 24 = 0
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD of 4408 and 1568 is 8.

Now, we can simplify the fraction \(\frac{4408}{1568}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 8:

\[
\frac{4408 \div 8}{1568 \div 8} = \frac{551}{196}
\]

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much water Susan will use if she adjusts the flour to 29 parts while keeping the same proportion, we can use the given ratio and set up a proportion.

The original ratio of flour to water is 30 parts of flour to 27 parts of water. This can be written as:
\[ \frac{30}{27} \]

If Susan uses 29 parts of flour instead, we need to find the corresponding amount of water, \( x \), that maintains the same ratio:
\[ \frac{30}{27} = \frac{29}{x} \]

We can solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[ 30x = 27 \times 29 \]

First, calculate \( 27 \times 29 \):
\[ 27 \times 29 = 783 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 30x = 783 \]
\[ x = \frac{783}{30} \]
\[ x = 26.1 \]

Thus, Susan will use 26.1 parts of water.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{24}{22}\right) \times \left(\frac{24}{17}\right)\), we first multiply the numerators and the denominators separately:

\[
\frac{24}{22} \times \frac{24}{17} = \frac{24 \times 24}{22 \times 17}
\]

Next, we calculate the products:

\[
24 \times 24 = 576
\]
\[
22 \times 17 = 374
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{576}{374}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 576 and 374. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 576 by 374 and find the remainder:
\[
576 \div 374 \approx 1 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 576 - 374 = 202
\]

2. Now, divide 374 by 202 and find the remainder:
\[
374 \div 202 \approx 1 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 374 - 202 = 172
\]

3. Next, divide 202 by 172 and find the remainder:
\[
202 \div 172 \approx 1 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 202 - 172 = 30
\]

4. Now, divide 172 by 30 and find the remainder:
\[
172 \div 30 \approx 5 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 172 - 150 = 22
\]

5. Next, divide 30 by 22 and find the remainder:
\[
30 \div 22 \approx 1 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 30 - 22 = 8
\]

6. Now, divide 22 by 8 and find the remainder:
\[
22 \div 8 \approx 2 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 22 - 16 = 6
\]

7. Next, divide 8 by 6 and find the remainder:
\[
8 \div 6 \approx 1 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 8 - 6 = 2
\]

8. Finally, divide 6 by 2 and find the remainder:
\[
6 \div 2 \approx 3 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 6 - 6 = 0
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD of 576 and 374 is 2.

We can now simplify the fraction \(\frac{576}{374}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 2:

\[
\frac{576 \div 2}{374 \div 2} = \frac{288}{187}

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">We start with the simplified fraction from the previous problem, which is \(\frac{288}{187}\). We need to multiply this by \(\frac{27}{18}\):

\[
\frac{288}{187} \times \frac{27}{18}
\]

First, we multiply the numerators and the denominators:

\[
\frac{288 \times 27}{187 \times 18}
\]

Next, we calculate the products:

\[
288 \times 27 = 7776
\]
\[
187 \times 18 = 3366
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{7776}{3366}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7776 and 3366. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 7776 by 3366 and find the remainder:
\[
7776 \div 3366 \approx 2 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 7776 - 6732 = 1044
\]

2. Now, divide 3366 by 1044 and find the remainder:
\[
3366 \div 1044 \approx 3 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 3366 - 3132 = 234
\]

3. Next, divide 1044 by 234 and find the remainder:
\[
1044 \div 234 \approx 4 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 1044 - 936 = 108
\]

4. Now, divide 234 by 108 and find the remainder:
\[
234 \div 108 \approx 2 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 234 - 216 = 18
\]

5. Finally, divide 108 by 18 and find the remainder:
\[
108 \div 18 \approx 6 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 108 - 108 = 0
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD of 7776 and 3366 is 18.

We can now simplify the fraction \(\frac{7776}{3366}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 18:

\[
\frac{7776 \div 18}{3366 \div 18} = \frac{432}{187}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{24}{22}\right) \times \left(\frac{24}{9}\right)\), we first multiply the numerators and the denominators separately:

\[
\frac{24}{22} \times \frac{24}{9} = \frac{24 \times 24}{22 \times 9}
\]

Next, we calculate the products:

\[
24 \times 24 = 576
\]
\[
22 \times 9 = 198
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{576}{198}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 576 and 198. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 576 by 198 and find the remainder:
\[
576 \div 198 \approx 2 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 576 - 2 \times 198 = 576 - 396 = 180
\]

2. Now, divide 198 by 180 and find the remainder:
\[
198 \div 180 \approx 1 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 198 - 180 = 18
\]

3. Next, divide 180 by 18 and find the remainder:
\[
180 \div 18 \approx 10 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 180 - 180 = 0
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD of 576 and 198 is 18.

We can now simplify the fraction \(\frac{576}{198}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 18:

\[
\frac{576 \div 18}{198 \div 18} = \frac{32}{11}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

\[ \text{Reciprocal of } \frac{16}{6} = \frac{6}{16} \]

Now, multiply \( \frac{25}{4} \) by \( \frac{6}{16} \):
\[ \frac{25}{4} \times \frac{6}{16} = \frac{25 \times 6}{4 \times 16} = \frac{150}{64} \]

Next, simplify \( \frac{150}{64} \) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 150 and 64. The GCD of 150 and 64 is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

\[ \frac{75}{32} \times \frac{19}{6} = \frac{75 \times 19}{32 \times 6} = \frac{1425}{192} \]

Next, we simplify \( \frac{1425}{192} \) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1425 and 192. The GCD of 1425 and 192 is 3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the result of multiplying the fractions \(\frac{3}{7}\) and \(\frac{26}{6}\), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
   \[
   3 \times 26 = 78
   \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
   \[
   7 \times 6 = 42
   \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[
\frac{78}{42}
\]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 78 and 42.

The prime factorization of 78 is:
\[
78 = 2 \times 3 \times 13
\]

The prime factorization of 42 is:
\[
42 = 2 \times 3 \times 7
\]

The common factors are 2 and 3. Therefore, the GCD of 78 and 42 is:
\[
2 \times 3 = 6
\]

We divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (6):
\[
\frac{78 \div 6}{42 \div 6} = \frac{13}{7}

So, the product of the fractions is:

2. Multiply the denominators together:

So, the product of the fractions is:

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 182 and 42.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the result of multiplying the previously found value \(\frac{667}{84}\) by \(\frac{21}{21}\), we follow these steps:

1. Write the expression:
   \[
   \left(\frac{667}{84}\right) \times \left(\frac{21}{21}\right)
   \]

2. Multiply the numerators together:
   \[
   667 \times 21 = 14007
   \]

3. Multiply the denominators together:
   \[
   84 \times 21 = 1764
   \]

4. Combine the results to form the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{14007}{1764}
   \]

5. Simplify the fraction if possible. We need to check if 14007 and 1764 have any common factors.

   - The prime factorization of 14007 is \(14007 = 3^2 \times 7 \times 223\).
   - The prime factorization of 1764 is \(1764 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7^2\).

   The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14007 and 1764 is \(3^2 \times 7 = 63\).

6. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (63):
   \[
   \frac{14007 \div 63}{1764 \div 63} = \frac{222}{28}
   \]

7. Simplify further if possible:
   - The prime factorization of 222 is \(222 = 2 \times 3 \times 37\).
   - The prime factorization of 28 is \(28 = 2^2 \times 7\).

   The GCD of 222 and 28 is 2.

8. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (2):
   \[
   \frac{222 \div 2}{28 \div 2} = \frac{111}{14}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of the multiplication of the fractions \( \frac{19}{12} \) and \( \frac{20}{6} \), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
\[ 19 \times 20 = 380 \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
\[ 12 \times 6 = 72 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{380}{72} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{380}{72} \). To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 380 and 72.

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 380: \( 380 = 2^2 \times 5 \times 19 \)
- 72: \( 72 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \)

The common factors are \( 2^2 \), so the GCD is \( 2^2 = 4 \).

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{380 \div 4}{72 \div 4} = \frac{95}{18} \]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

Now, we need to multiply \( \frac{95}{18} \) by itself:
\[ \left( \frac{95}{18} \right) \times \left( \frac{95}{18} \right) \]

First, multiply the numerators:
\[ 95 \times 95 = 9025 \]

Next, multiply the denominators:
\[ 18 \times 18 = 324 \]

So, the product is:
\[ \frac{9025}{324} \]

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9025 and 324.

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 9025: \( 9025 = 5^2 \times 19^2 \)
- 324: \( 324 = 2^2 \times 3^4 \)

Since there are no common prime factors between 9025 and 324, the GCD is 1.

2. Multiply the denominators together:
\[ 12 \times 6 = 72 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:

- 200: \( 200 = 2^3 \times 5^2 \)
- 72: \( 72 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \)

The common factors are \( 2^3 \), so the GCD is \( 2^3 = 8 \).

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total fractional representation of the cargo hauled in one day, we need to add the fractions representing the cargo in the morning and the afternoon.

First, let's simplify each fraction:

1. Simplify \( \frac{28}{21} \):
   \[
   \frac{28}{21} = \frac{28 \div 7}{21 \div 7} = \frac{4}{3}
   \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{22}{4} \):
   \[
   \frac{22}{4} = \frac{22 \div 2}{4 \div 2} = \frac{11}{2}
   \]

Next, we need to add these two fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 2 is 6.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 6:
\[
\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 2}{3 \times 2} = \frac{8}{6}
\]
\[
\frac{11}{2} = \frac{11 \times 3}{2 \times 3} = \frac{33}{6}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{8}{6} + \frac{33}{6} = \frac{8 + 33}{6} = \frac{41}{6}
\]

Thus, the total fractional representation of the cargo hauled in one day is:
\[
\frac{41}{6}

1. Simplify the numerator and the denominator separately.
2. Divide the simplified numerator by the simplified denominator.

First, simplify the numerator:
\[ 16 / 4 = 4 \]

Next, simplify the denominator:
\[ 24 / 21 \]

To simplify \( 24 / 21 \), we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:
\[ 24 / 21 = (24 \div 3) / (21 \div 3) = 8 / 7 \]

Now, we need to divide the simplified numerator by the simplified denominator:
\[ 4 / (8 / 7) \]

Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal:
\[ 4 \times (7 / 8) \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 4 \times 7 = 28 \]
\[ 28 / 8 \]

Simplify \( 28 / 8 \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 4:
\[ 28 / 8 = (28 \div 4) / (8 \div 4) = 7 / 2 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously found that the product of \( \frac{5}{27} \) and \( \frac{15}{2} \) is \( \frac{25}{18} \).

Now, we need to multiply \( \frac{25}{18} \) by itself:

\[
\left( \frac{25}{18} \right) \times \left( \frac{25}{18} \right) = \frac{25 \times 25}{18 \times 18}
\]

First, calculate the numerators and denominators:

\[
25 \times 25 = 625
\]
\[
18 \times 18 = 324
\]

So, the product is:

\[
\frac{625}{324}
\]

Next, we check if this fraction can be simplified. We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 625 and 324. The prime factorizations are:

\[
625 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5
\]
\[
324 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3
\]

There are no common factors between 625 and 324, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the product of the fractions \( \frac{24}{27} \) and \( \frac{15}{2} \), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{24}{27} \times \frac{15}{2} = \frac{24 \times 15}{27 \times 2}
\]

First, calculate the numerators and denominators:

\[
24 \times 15 = 360
\]
\[
27 \times 2 = 54
\]

So, the product is:

\[
\frac{360}{54}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 360 and 54. The prime factorizations are:

\[
360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5
\]
\[
54 = 2 \times 3^3
\]

The common factors are \(2\) and \(3^2\). The GCD is \(2 \times 3^2 = 18\). Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 18:

\[
\frac{360 \div 18}{54 \div 18} = \frac{20}{3}
\]

Thus, the simplified form of the product is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the product of the fractions \(\frac{15}{13} \times \frac{19}{7}\), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{15}{13} \times \frac{19}{7} = \frac{15 \times 19}{13 \times 7}
\]

First, we calculate the product of the numerators:

\[
15 \times 19 = 285
\]

Next, we calculate the product of the denominators:

\[
13 \times 7 = 91
\]

So, the product of the fractions is:

\[
\frac{285}{91}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 285 and 91. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 285 by 91 and find the remainder:
\[
285 \div 91 = 3 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 285 - 3 \times 91 = 12
\]

2. Now, divide 91 by 12 and find the remainder:
\[
91 \div 12 = 7 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 91 - 7 \times 12 = 7
\]

3. Next, divide 12 by 7 and find the remainder:
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 12 - 1 \times 7 = 5
\]

4. Now, divide 7 by 5 and find the remainder:
\[
7 \div 5 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 7 - 1 \times 5 = 2
\]

5. Next, divide 5 by 2 and find the remainder:
\[
5 \div 2 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5 - 2 \times 2 = 1
\]

6. Finally, divide 2 by 1:
\[
2 \div 1 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 2 - 2 \times 1 = 0
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 1. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{285}{91}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we start with the product of the fractions \(\frac{15}{13} \times \frac{19}{7}\), which we previously calculated as \(\frac{285}{91}\).

Next, we need to multiply this result by another fraction, \(\frac{23}{22}\):

\[
\frac{285}{91} \times \frac{23}{22} = \frac{285 \times 23}{91 \times 22}
\]

First, we calculate the product of the numerators:

\[
285 \times 23 = 6555
\]

Next, we calculate the product of the denominators:

\[
91 \times 22 = 2002
\]

So, the product of the fractions is:

\[
\frac{6555}{2002}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6555 and 2002. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 6555 by 2002 and find the remainder:
\[
6555 \div 2002 = 3 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6555 - 3 \times 2002 = 1549
\]

2. Now, divide 2002 by 1549 and find the remainder:
\[
2002 \div 1549 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 2002 - 1 \times 1549 = 453
\]

3. Next, divide 1549 by 453 and find the remainder:
\[
1549 \div 453 = 3 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1549 - 3 \times 453 = 190
\]

4. Now, divide 453 by 190 and find the remainder:
\[
453 \div 190 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 453 - 2 \times 190 = 73
\]

5. Next, divide 190 by 73 and find the remainder:
\[
190 \div 73 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 190 - 2 \times 73 = 44
\]

6. Now, divide 73 by 44 and find the remainder:
\[
73 \div 44 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 73 - 1 \times 44 = 29
\]

7. Next, divide 44 by 29 and find the remainder:
\[
44 \div 29 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 44 - 1 \times 29 = 15
\]

8. Now, divide 29 by 15 and find the remainder:
\[
29 \div 15 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 29 - 1 \times 15 = 14
\]

9. Next, divide 15 by 14 and find the remainder:
\[
15 \div 14 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 15 - 1 \times 14 = 1
\]

10. Finally, divide 14 by 1:
\[
14 \div 1 = 14 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 14 - 14 \times 1 = 0
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 1. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{6555}{2002}\) is already in its simplest form.

\]

First, we calculate the product of the numerators:

\[
15 \times 19 = 285
\]

Next, we calculate the product of the denominators:

\[
29 \times 7 = 203
\]

So, the product of the fractions is:

\[
\frac{285}{203}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 285 and 203. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 285 by 203 and find the remainder:
\[
285 \div 203 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 285 - 1 \times 203 = 82
\]

2. Now, divide 203 by 82 and find the remainder:
\[
203 \div 82 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 203 - 2 \times 82 = 39
\]

3. Next, divide 82 by 39 and find the remainder:
\[
82 \div 39 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 82 - 2 \times 39 = 4
\]

4. Now, divide 39 by 4 and find the remainder:
\[
39 \div 4 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 39 - 9 \times 4 = 3
\]

5. Finally, divide 4 by 3 and find the remainder:
\[
4 \div 3 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 4 - 1 \times 3 = 1

Since the remainder is now 1, the GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{285}{203}\) is already in its simplest form.

\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
23 \times 27 = 621

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
22 \times 20 = 440

So, the product of the fractions is:

\[
\frac{621}{440}

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 621 and 440. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 621 by 440 to get the remainder:

2. Divide 440 by 181 to get the remainder:

3. Divide 181 by 78 to get the remainder:

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction \( \frac{621}{440} \) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to multiply the two fractions and then simplify the result.

First, let's multiply the numerators and the denominators:

\[
\frac{14}{10} \times \frac{30}{5} = \frac{14 \times 30}{10 \times 5}
\]

Calculate the products:

\[
14 \times 30 = 420
\]
\[
10 \times 5 = 50
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{420}{50}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 420 and 50. The GCD of 420 and 50 is 10.

Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

\[
\frac{420 \div 10}{50 \div 10} = \frac{42}{5}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

\[
\frac{42}{5}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already calculated the multiplication of \(\frac{14}{10}\) by \(\frac{30}{5}\) and found it to be \(\frac{42}{5}\).

Now, we need to multiply this result by \(\frac{13}{15}\):

\[
\frac{42}{5} \times \frac{13}{15} = \frac{42 \times 13}{5 \times 15}

Calculate the products:

\[

\[

So, we have:

\[
\frac{546}{75}

Next, we simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 546 and 75. The GCD of 546 and 75 is 3.

Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many batches of cookies the baker can make, we need to calculate \(\frac{26}{1} \div \frac{29}{14}\).

First, recall that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{26}{1} \times \frac{14}{29}
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication of the fractions:
\[
\frac{26 \times 14}{1 \times 29} = \frac{364}{29}
\]

Now, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{364}{29}\). We perform the division:
\[
364 \div 29 = 12.55

So, the expression becomes:

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 648 and 286.

The expression to evaluate is:
\[

\]

1. Multiply the numerators together:
   \[
   324 \times 14 = 4536
   \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
   \[
   143 \times 27 = 3861

So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{4536}{3861}
\]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4536 and 3861.

First, we find the prime factorizations of both numbers:
- 4536: \(4536 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 7 \times 3 = 2^3 \times 3^5 \times 7\)
- 3861: \(3861 = 3 \times 1287 = 3 \times 3 \times 429 = 3^2 \times 429 = 3^2 \times 3 \times 143 = 3^3 \times 143\)

The common factor is \(3^3\).

Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (which is 27):
\[

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the multiplication of the fractions \(\frac{26}{9}\) and \(\frac{17}{13}\), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
   \[
   26 \times 17 = 442
   \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
   \[
   9 \times 13 = 117
   \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[
\frac{442}{117}
\]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 442 and 117.

First, we use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:
- Divide 442 by 117, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 91:
  \[
  442 = 117 \times 3 + 91
  \]
- Next, divide 117 by 91, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 26:
  \[
  117 = 91 \times 1 + 26
  \]
- Then, divide 91 by 26, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 13:
  \[
  91 = 26 \times 3 + 13
  \]
- Finally, divide 26 by 13, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0:
  \[
  26 = 13 \times 2 + 0
  \]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 13.

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator of \(\frac{442}{117}\) by their GCD, 13:
\[
\frac{442 \div 13}{117 \div 13} = \frac{34}{9}

Thus, the simplified form of the product is:

\frac{34}{9}

   9 \times 30 = 270
   \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[
\frac{816}{270}
\]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 816 and 270.

First, we use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:
- Divide 816 by 270, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 6:
  \[
  816 = 270 \times 3 + 6
  \]
- Next, divide 270 by 6, which gives a quotient of 45 and a remainder of 0:
  \[
  270 = 6 \times 45 + 0
  \]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 6.

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator of \(\frac{816}{270}\) by their GCD, 6:
\[
\frac{816 \div 6}{270 \div 6} = \frac{136}{45}
\]

Thus, the simplified form of the product is:
\[
\frac{136}{45}
\]

            If instead of multiplying the fraction 26/9 by the fraction 17/13, you multiplied 25/9 by 17/13, what would the result be in simplest form?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the multiplication of the fractions \(\frac{25}{9}\) and \(\frac{17}{13}\), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
   \[
   25 \times 17 = 425
   \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
   \[
   9 \times 13 = 117
   \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[
\frac{425}{117}
\]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 425 and 117.

First, we use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:
- Divide 425 by 117, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 74:
  \[
  425 = 117 \times 3 + 74
  \]
- Next, divide 117 by 74, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 43:
  \[
  117 = 74 \times 1 + 43
  \]
- Then, divide 74 by 43, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 31:
  \[
  74 = 43 \times 1 + 31
  \]
- Next, divide 43 by 31, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 12:
  \[
  43 = 31 \times 1 + 12
  \]
- Then, divide 31 by 12, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 7:
  \[
  31 = 12 \times 2 + 7
  \]
- Finally, divide 12 by 7, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 5:
  \[
  12 = 7 \times 1 + 5
  \]
- Continue dividing 7 by 5, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2:
  \[
  7 = 5 \times 1 + 2
  \]
- Finally, divide 5 by 2, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1:
  \[
  5 = 2 \times 2 + 1
  \]
- Lastly, divide 2 by 1, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0:
  \[
  2 = 1 \times 2 + 0
  \]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 1.

Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \(\frac{425}{117}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\frac{28}{16} \div \frac{27}{24}\), we can use the property of division of fractions, which states that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\frac{28}{16} \div \frac{27}{24} = \frac{28}{16} \times \frac{24}{27}
\]

Next, we simplify the fractions before multiplying. 

First, simplify \(\frac{28}{16}\):
\[
\frac{28}{16} = \frac{28 \div 4}{16 \div 4} = \frac{7}{4}
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{24}{27}\):
\[
\frac{24}{27} \text{ is already in its simplest form.}
\]

Now, multiply the simplified fractions:
\[
\frac{7}{4} \times \frac{24}{27} = \frac{7 \times 24}{4 \times 27} = \frac{168}{108}
\]

Finally, simplify \(\frac{168}{108}\):
\[
\frac{168}{108} = \frac{168 \div 12}{108 \div 12} = \frac{14}{9}
\]

Thus, the result of the expression \(\frac{28}{16} \div \frac{27}{24}\) is:

\[
\frac{95}{26}

Now, we need to multiply this by the fraction \(\frac{14}{24}\):
\[

\]

First, multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[
\frac{95 \times 14}{26 \times 24} = \frac{1330}{624}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{1330}{624}\). To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1330 and 624.

1. Prime factorization of 1330:

2. Prime factorization of 624:

The common factor is 2. Therefore, the GCD is 2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the result of \(14 \div \left(\frac{26}{15}\right)\), we can use the property of division of fractions, which states that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.

First, find the reciprocal of \(\frac{26}{15}\):
\[
\text{Reciprocal of } \frac{26}{15} = \frac{15}{26}
\]

Next, multiply 14 by \(\frac{15}{26}\):
\[
14 \times \frac{15}{26} = \frac{14 \times 15}{26} = \frac{210}{26}
\]

Now, simplify the fraction \(\frac{210}{26}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 210 and 26, which is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{210 \div 2}{26 \div 2} = \frac{105}{13}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{105}{13}\) is in its simplest form.

So, the product of the fractions is:

Calculate the products:

So, we have:

            In the previous scenario, instead of starting with a fraction of 9/8, let's say we started with a simpler fraction of 9 and divide it by the complex fraction 20/18. What would be the result? In other words, calculate (9 / (20 / 18)). Express your final answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem \(\frac{9}{\frac{20}{18}}\), we can use the property of division of fractions, which states that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.

First, find the reciprocal of \(\frac{20}{18}\):
\[
\text{Reciprocal of } \frac{20}{18} = \frac{18}{20}
\]

Now, multiply 9 by \(\frac{18}{20}\):
\[
9 \times \frac{18}{20}
\]

Next, express 9 as a fraction:
\[
9 = \frac{9}{1}
\]

Now, multiply the fractions:
\[
\frac{9}{1} \times \frac{18}{20} = \frac{9 \times 18}{1 \times 20} = \frac{162}{20}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{162}{20}\), find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 162 and 20. The GCD of 162 and 20 is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{162 \div 2}{20 \div 2} = \frac{81}{10}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:
\[
\frac{81}{10}
\]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \((30 / 6) / (13 / 9)\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the numerator and the denominator separately.
2. Divide the simplified numerator by the simplified denominator.

First, simplify the numerator:
\[ 30 / 6 = 5 \]

Next, simplify the denominator:
\[ 13 / 9 \]

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:
\[ 5 / (13 / 9) = 5 \times (9 / 13) \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 5 \times (9 / 13) = (5 \times 9) / 13 = 45 / 13 \]

Thus, the result of the operation \((30 / 6) / (13 / 9)\) is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new result, we need to multiply the previous answer \(\frac{45}{13}\) by \(\frac{14}{4}\).

First, write the multiplication of the two fractions:

Next, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
\[ \frac{45 \times 14}{13 \times 4} \]

Calculate the products:
\[ 45 \times 14 = 630 \]
\[ 13 \times 4 = 52 \]

So, the result is:
\[ \frac{630}{52} \]

Now, simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 630 and 52. The GCD of 630 and 52 is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem \(\left(\frac{21}{9}\right) \times \left(\frac{29}{6}\right)\), we first multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

First, multiply the numerators:
\[ 21 \times 29 = 609 \]

Next, multiply the denominators:
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{609}{54} \]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 609 and 54. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 609 by 54:
\[ 609 \div 54 = 11 \text{ remainder } 15 \]
So, \( 609 = 54 \times 11 + 15 \).

2. Now, find the GCD of 54 and 15:
\[ 54 \div 15 = 3 \text{ remainder } 9 \]
So, \( 54 = 15 \times 3 + 9 \).

3. Next, find the GCD of 15 and 9:
\[ 15 \div 9 = 1 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
So, \( 15 = 9 \times 1 + 6 \).

4. Now, find the GCD of 9 and 6:
\[ 9 \div 6 = 1 \text{ remainder } 3 \]
So, \( 9 = 6 \times 1 + 3 \).

5. Finally, find the GCD of 6 and 3:
\[ 6 \div 3 = 2 \text{ remainder } 0 \]
So, \( 6 = 3 \times 2 + 0 \).

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 3.

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator of \(\frac{609}{54}\) by their GCD, which is 3:
\[ \frac{609 \div 3}{54 \div 3} = \frac{203}{18} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the product of the fractions \(\frac{25}{22}\) and \(\frac{20}{3}\), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{25}{22} \times \frac{20}{3} = \frac{25 \times 20}{22 \times 3}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
25 \times 20 = 500
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
22 \times 3 = 66
\]

So, the product is:

\[
\frac{500}{66}

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 500 and 66. The prime factorization of 500 is \(2^2 \times 5^3\), and the prime factorization of 66 is \(2 \times 3 \times 11\). The only common factor is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 2:

\[
\frac{500 \div 2}{66 \div 2} = \frac{250}{33}

So, the product is:

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7000 and 957. The prime factorization of 7000 is \(2^3 \times 5^3 \times 7\), and the prime factorization of 957 is \(3 \times 11 \times 29\). There are no common factors between 7000 and 957 other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \((\frac{5}{3}) \times (\frac{27}{9})\), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{5}{3} \times \frac{27}{9} = \frac{5 \times 27}{3 \times 9}
\]

First, calculate the product of the numerators:

\[
5 \times 27 = 135
\]

Next, calculate the product of the denominators:

\[
3 \times 9 = 27
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{135}{27}
\]

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 135 and 27. The prime factorization of 135 is \(3^3 \times 5\), and the prime factorization of 27 is \(3^3\). The common factor is \(3^3 = 27\).

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 27:

\[
\frac{135 \div 27}{27 \div 27} = \frac{5}{1}
\]

Since \(\frac{5}{1}\) simplifies to 5, the final answer is:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the product of the fractions \( \frac{11}{19} \) and \( \frac{22}{7} \), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{11}{19} \times \frac{22}{7} = \frac{11 \times 22}{19 \times 7}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
11 \times 22 = 242
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
19 \times 7 = 133
\]

So, the product of the fractions is:

\[
\frac{242}{133}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 242 and 133. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:

1. Divide 242 by 133, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 109:
   \[
   242 = 133 \times 1 + 109
   \]

2. Divide 133 by 109, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 24:
   \[
   133 = 109 \times 1 + 24
   \]

3. Divide 109 by 24, which gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 13:
   \[
   109 = 24 \times 4 + 13
   \]

4. Divide 24 by 13, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 11:
   \[
   24 = 13 \times 1 + 11
   \]

5. Divide 13 by 11, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2:
   \[
   13 = 11 \times 1 + 2
   \]

6. Divide 11 by 2, which gives a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 1:
   \[
   11 = 2 \times 5 + 1
   \]

7. Finally, divide 2 by 1, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0:
   \[
   2 = 1 \times 2 + 0
   \]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 1. Therefore, the fraction \( \frac{242}{133} \) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we already found the product of the fractions \( \frac{11}{19} \) and \( \frac{22}{7} \):

\[
\frac{11}{19} \times \frac{22}{7} = \frac{242}{133}
\]

Next, we need to multiply this result by \( \frac{25}{4} \):

\[
\frac{242}{133} \times \frac{25}{4} = \frac{242 \times 25}{133 \times 4}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
242 \times 25 = 6050
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
133 \times 4 = 532
\]

So, the product of the fractions is:

\[
\frac{6050}{532}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6050 and 532. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:

1. Divide 6050 by 532, which gives a quotient of 11 and a remainder of 258:
   \[
   6050 = 532 \times 11 + 258
   \]

2. Divide 532 by 258, which gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 16:
   \[
   532 = 258 \times 2 + 16
   \]

3. Divide 258 by 16, which gives a quotient of 16 and a remainder of 2:
   \[
   258 = 16 \times 16 + 2
   \]

4. Finally, divide 16 by 2, which gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 0:
   \[
   16 = 2 \times 8 + 0
   \]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 2. Therefore, we can simplify the fraction \( \frac{6050}{532} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[
\frac{6050 \div 2}{532 \div 2} = \frac{3025}{266}

1. Multiply the numerators together:

2. Multiply the denominators together:
\[ 30 \times 5 = 150 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{399}{150} \]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 399 and 150.

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 399: \( 399 = 3 \times 133 = 3 \times 7 \times 19 \)
- 150: \( 150 = 2 \times 75 = 2 \times 3 \times 25 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 5 \)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of multiplying \( \frac{253}{120} \) by itself, we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
\[ 253 \times 253 = 253^2 = 64009 \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
\[ 120 \times 120 = 120^2 = 14400 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{64009}{14400} \]

Next, we check if the fraction can be simplified. We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 64009 and 14400.

- The prime factors of 64009 are 64009 itself (since 64009 is a prime number).
- The prime factors of 14400 are \( 2^6 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \).

Since 64009 and 14400 have no common prime factors, their GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction \( \frac{64009}{14400} \) is already in its simplest form.

            In the previous problem, you multiplied the fractions 11/15 and 23/8. But what if instead, you multiply the fractions 11/15 and 26/8? What would be the result of this change? Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of multiplying the fractions \( \frac{11}{15} \) and \( \frac{26}{8} \), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
\[ 11 \times 26 = 286 \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{286}{120} \]

Next, we need to simplify the fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 286 and 120.

- The prime factors of 286 are 2 and 143 (since \( 286 = 2 \times 143 \)).
- The prime factors of 120 are 2, 3, and 5 (since \( 120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 \)).

The common factor between 286 and 120 is 2. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 2:

\[ \frac{286 \div 2}{120 \div 2} = \frac{143}{60} \]

Since 143 and 60 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction \( \frac{143}{60} \) is in its simplest form.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of \(\frac{29}{16} \times \frac{21}{27}\), we first multiply the numerators together and then the denominators together:

\[
\frac{29}{16} \times \frac{21}{27} = \frac{29 \times 21}{16 \times 27}
\]

Next, we calculate the products:

\[
29 \times 21 = 609
\]
\[
16 \times 27 = 432
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{609}{432}
\]

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 609 and 432. 

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 609: \(609 = 3 \times 7 \times 29\)
- 432: \(432 = 2^4 \times 3^3\)

The common factor is 3. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{609 \div 3}{432 \div 3} = \frac{203}{144}
\]

Since 203 and 144 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously found that \(\frac{29}{16} \times \frac{21}{27} = \frac{203}{144}\).

Now, we need to multiply \(\frac{203}{144}\) by itself:

\[
\left(\frac{203}{144}\right)^2 = \frac{203 \times 203}{144 \times 144}

First, calculate the products:

\[
203 \times 203 = 41209
\]
\[
144 \times 144 = 20736
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{41209}{20736}
\]

Next, we need to check if this fraction can be simplified. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 41209 and 20736. 

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
1. \(41209 \div 20736 = 1\) with a remainder of \(20473\)
2. \(20736 \div 20473 = 1\) with a remainder of \(263\)
3. \(20473 \div 263 = 77\) with a remainder of \(0\)

Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \(\frac{41209}{20736}\) is already in its simplest form.

\[
\frac{29}{5} \times \frac{21}{27} = \frac{29 \times 21}{5 \times 27}
\]

Next, we calculate the products:

\[
29 \times 21 = 609
\]
\[
5 \times 27 = 135
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{609}{135}
\]

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 609 and 135. 

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 609: \(609 = 3 \times 7 \times 29\)
- 135: \(135 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 = 3^3 \times 5\)

The common factor is 3. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{609 \div 3}{135 \div 3} = \frac{203}{45}

Since 203 and 45 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem \(\frac{28}{1} \div \frac{30}{27}\), we first need to understand that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.

1. Start with the given expression:
   \[

   \]

2. Replace the division with multiplication by the reciprocal of \(\frac{30}{27}\):
   \[
   \frac{28}{1} \times \frac{27}{30}
   \]

3. Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
   \[
   \frac{28 \times 27}{1 \times 30} = \frac{756}{30}
   \]

4. Simplify the fraction \(\frac{756}{30}\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 756 and 30. The GCD of 756 and 30 is 6.

5. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply the fraction \( \frac{5}{1} \) by \( \frac{16}{27} \), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators: \( 5 \times 16 = 80 \).

So, the product is \( \frac{80}{27} \).

Next, we check if the fraction \( \frac{80}{27} \) can be simplified. Since 80 and 27 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply the fraction \( \frac{30}{1} \) by \( \frac{16}{27} \), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators: \( 30 \times 16 = 480 \).
2. Multiply the denominators: \( 1 \times 27 = 27 \).

So, the product is \( \frac{480}{27} \).

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{480}{27} \). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 480 and 27.

- The prime factorization of 480 is \( 2^5 \times 3 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 27 is \( 3^3 \).

The common factor is 3.

Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 3:

\[ \frac{480 \div 3}{27 \div 3} = \frac{160}{9} \]

Thus, the simplified fraction is \( \frac{160}{9} \).

Next, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

Now, we need to multiply this result by \(\frac{20}{26}\):

\frac{320}{221} \times \frac{20}{26}
\]

First, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{320 \times 20}{221 \times 26} = \frac{6400}{5746}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{6400}{5746}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6400 and 5746. 

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
1. \(6400 \div 5746 = 1\) with a remainder of \(654\).
2. \(5746 \div 654 = 8\) with a remainder of \(494\).
3. \(654 \div 494 = 1\) with a remainder of \(160\).
4. \(494 \div 160 = 3\) with a remainder of \(14\).
5. \(160 \div 14 = 11\) with a remainder of \(6\).
6. \(14 \div 6 = 2\) with a remainder of \(2\).
7. \(6 \div 2 = 3\) with a remainder of \(0\).

The GCD is 2.

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

1. Multiply the numerators together:

   \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:

3. Combine the results to form a single fraction:

4. Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 570 and 552. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:

   - \(570 \div 552 = 1\) with a remainder of \(18\)
   - \(552 \div 18 = 30\) with no remainder

   Therefore, the GCD of 570 and 552 is 18.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate the expression \(\frac{23}{26} \times \frac{16}{1}\), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{23 \times 16}{26 \times 1}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
23 \times 16 = 368
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
26 \times 1 = 26
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{368}{26}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 368 and 26. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:

1. Divide 368 by 26 to get the quotient and remainder:
   \[
   368 \div 26 = 14 \quad \text{remainder} \, 4
   \]

2. Now, divide 26 by the remainder 4:
   \[
   26 \div 4 = 6 \quad \text{remainder} \, 2
   \]

3. Next, divide 4 by the remainder 2:
   \[
   4 \div 2 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \, 0
   \]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 2.

Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (2):

\[
\frac{368 \div 2}{26 \div 2} = \frac{184}{13}

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously calculated \( g = \frac{184}{13} \).

Now, we need to find the value of \( \left(\frac{4}{7}\right) \times g \).

Substitute \( g \) with \(\frac{184}{13}\):

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right) \times \left(\frac{184}{13}\right)
\]

To multiply these fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{4 \times 184}{7 \times 13}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
4 \times 184 = 736
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
7 \times 13 = 91
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{736}{91}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to check if there is a common divisor between 736 and 91. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:

1. Divide 736 by 91 to get the quotient and remainder:
   \[
   736 \div 91 = 8 \quad \text{remainder} \, 8
   \]

2. Now, divide 91 by the remainder 8:
   \[
   91 \div 8 = 11 \quad \text{remainder} \, 3

3. Next, divide 8 by the remainder 3:
   \[
   8 \div 3 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \, 2
   \]

4. Finally, divide 3 by the remainder 2:
   \[
   3 \div 2 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \, 1

Since the remainder is now 1, the GCD is 1.

Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \(\frac{736}{91}\) is already in its simplest form.

First, we find the reciprocal of \(\frac{26}{20}\):
\[
\frac{26}{20} \rightarrow \frac{20}{26}

Next, we multiply \(\frac{21}{1}\) by \(\frac{20}{26}\):

Now, we simplify \(\frac{420}{26}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 420 and 26, which is 2.

Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

Next, we check if the fraction \(\frac{4410}{377}\) can be simplified. We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4410 and 377. 

Using the Euclidean algorithm:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the amount of sugar and flour Jim needs for the original cake.

The amount of sugar required is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ cups} \]

The amount of flour required is:
\[ \frac{17}{14} \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to multiply these two quantities together:
\[ 6 \times \frac{17}{14} \]

To perform this multiplication, we can write 6 as a fraction:
\[ 6 = \frac{6}{1} \]

Now, multiply the fractions:
\[ \frac{6}{1} \times \frac{17}{14} = \frac{6 \times 17}{1 \times 14} = \frac{102}{14} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{102}{14}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 102 and 14, which is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{102 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{51}{7} \]

Thus, the total amount of sugar and flour Jim needs is:

The amount of sugar required is:

The corrected amount of flour required is:

Now, we need to multiply these two quantities together:

To perform this multiplication, we can write 6 as a fraction:
\[ 6 = \frac{6}{1} \]

Now, multiply the fractions:
\[ \frac{6}{1} \times \frac{30}{14} = \frac{6 \times 30}{1 \times 14} = \frac{180}{14} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{180}{14}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 180 and 14, which is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{180 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{90}{7} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{21}{16}\right) \div \left(\frac{27}{23}\right)\), we need to remember that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\left(\frac{21}{16}\right) \div \left(\frac{27}{23}\right) = \left(\frac{21}{16}\right) \times \left(\frac{23}{27}\right)
\]

Next, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{21 \times 23}{16 \times 27}
\]

Calculating the products:

\[
21 \times 23 = 483
\]
\[
16 \times 27 = 432
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{483}{432}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 483 and 432. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:

1. \(483 \div 432 = 1\) with a remainder of \(51\)
2. \(432 \div 51 = 8\) with a remainder of \(24\)
3. \(51 \div 24 = 2\) with a remainder of \(3\)
4. \(24 \div 3 = 8\) with a remainder of \(0\)

The GCD is \(3\).

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

\[
\frac{483 \div 3}{432 \div 3} = \frac{161}{144}

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

First, we square both the numerator and the denominator:

\]

Next, we calculate the squares of the numerator and the denominator:

\[
161^2 = 25921
\]
\[
144^2 = 20736

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{25921}{20736}

To simplify this fraction, we need to check if there is a common divisor for 25921 and 20736. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 25921 and 20736:

1. \(25921 \div 20736 = 1\) with a remainder of \(5185\)

Next, we multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:

Calculating the product:

\[
6 \times 23 = 138

So, the expression becomes:

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 138 and 27. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD:

1. \(138 \div 27 = 5\) with a remainder of \(3\)
2. \(27 \div 3 = 9\) with a remainder of \(0\)

The GCD is \(3\).

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

            Previously, you calculated the answer to ((6 / 19) * (28 / 2)). Now, consider if you had originally calculated ((17 / 19) * (28 / 2)) instead of ((6 / 19) * (28 / 2)). What would be the result of this calculation as a simplified fraction?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{17}{19}\right) \times \left(\frac{28}{2}\right)\), we first simplify the fraction \(\frac{28}{2}\):

\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14
\]

Now, the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{17}{19}\right) \times 14
\]

We can write 14 as a fraction:

\[
14 = \frac{14}{1}
\]

So the expression is now:

\[
\left(\frac{17}{19}\right) \times \left(\frac{14}{1}\right)
\]

To multiply these fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{17 \times 14}{19 \times 1} = \frac{238}{19}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{238}{19}\). We perform the division:

\[
238 \div 19 = 12.5263
\]

Since 238 is exactly divisible by 19, we get:

\[
\frac{238}{19} = 12
\]

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we start by performing the multiplication of the two fractions:

\[
\left( \frac{12}{14} \right) \times \left( \frac{28}{5} \right)
\]

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{12 \times 28}{14 \times 5}
\]

Next, we calculate the products in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
12 \times 28 = 336
\]
\[
14 \times 5 = 70
\]

So, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{336}{70}
\]

Now, we need to simplify this fraction to its lowest terms. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 336 and 70. 

First, we find the prime factorizations of both numbers:
- The prime factorization of 336 is \( 2^4 \times 3 \times 7 \).
- The prime factorization of 70 is \( 2 \times 5 \times 7 \).

The common factors are \( 2 \) and \( 7 \). Therefore, the GCD is:

\[
2 \times 7 = 14
\]

We divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (14):

\[
\frac{336 \div 14}{70 \div 14} = \frac{24}{5}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

\[
\frac{24}{5}
\]

            You were given a fraction after calculating the result of (12 / 14) * (28 / 5) in a previous problem. Now multiply your result by 15/10. What new fraction do you get? Simplify your answer to the lowest terms.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We start with the fraction obtained from the previous problem, which is \(\frac{24}{5}\). We need to multiply this fraction by \(\frac{15}{10}\):

\[
\frac{24}{5} \times \frac{15}{10}
\]

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{24 \times 15}{5 \times 10}
\]

Next, we calculate the products in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
24 \times 15 = 360
\]
\[
5 \times 10 = 50
\]

So, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{360}{50}
\]

Now, we need to simplify this fraction to its lowest terms. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 360 and 50. 

First, we find the prime factorizations of both numbers:
- The prime factorization of 360 is \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5 \).
- The prime factorization of 50 is \( 2 \times 5^2 \).

The common factors are \( 2 \) and \( 5 \). Therefore, the GCD is:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10
\]

We divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (10):

\[
\frac{360 \div 10}{50 \div 10} = \frac{36}{5}

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

\[

Next, we calculate the products in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
14 \times 5 = 70
\]

So, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{84}{70}

Now, we need to simplify this fraction to its lowest terms. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 84 and 70. 

First, we find the prime factorizations of both numbers:
- The prime factorization of 84 is \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 7 \).
- The prime factorization of 70 is \( 2 \times 5 \times 7 \).

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

So, the expression becomes:

Next, we simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 152 and 45. 

First, we list the factors:

            Following the previous problem, consider that you got an answer x from calculating (20 / 10) * (10 / 1). Now, evaluate z by multiplying your previous answer x with the fraction (19 / 15). Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, recall the previous answer \( x = 20 \).

Now, we need to multiply \( x \) by the fraction \( \frac{19}{15} \):

\[
z = 20 \times \frac{19}{15}
\]

To perform this multiplication, we can write 20 as a fraction:

\[
20 = \frac{20}{1}
\]

Now, multiply the fractions:

\[
\frac{20}{1} \times \frac{19}{15} = \frac{20 \times 19}{1 \times 15} = \frac{380}{15}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{380}{15} \). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 380 and 15, which is 5.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

\[
\frac{380 \div 5}{15 \div 5} = \frac{76}{3}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

\[
\frac{76}{3}

   - \(\frac{27}{18} = \frac{27 \div 9}{18 \div 9} = \frac{3}{2}\).

2. The fraction \(\frac{19}{8}\) is already in its simplest form.

Now, multiply the simplified fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\frac{57}{16} \times \frac{28}{16}\), we first multiply the numerators and the denominators:

\[
\frac{57 \times 28}{16 \times 16} = \frac{1596}{256}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{1596}{256}\). To do this, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1596 and 256.

1. Prime factorization of 1596:
   - 1596 is even, so divide by 2: \(1596 \div 2 = 798\)
   - 798 is even, so divide by 2: \(798 \div 2 = 399\)
   - 399 is divisible by 3: \(399 \div 3 = 133\)
   - 133 is divisible by 7: \(133 \div 7 = 19\)
   - 19 is a prime number.

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 1596 is \(2^2 \times 3 \times 7 \times 19\).

2. Prime factorization of 256:
   - 256 is a power of 2: \(256 = 2^8\).

The common factors are \(2^2\). Therefore, the GCD of 1596 and 256 is \(2^2 = 4\).

Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD (4):

\[
\frac{1596 \div 4}{256 \div 4} = \frac{399}{64}

The fraction \(\frac{399}{64}\) is already in its simplest form.

Now, we need to multiply \( \frac{377}{120} \) by \( \frac{25}{11} \).

1. Multiply the numerators together:
\[ 377 \times 25 = 9425 \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
\[ 120 \times 11 = 1320 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{9425}{1320} \). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9425 and 1320.

- The prime factors of 1320 are 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, and 11.

The common factor is 5.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
\[ \frac{9425 \div 5}{1320 \div 5} = \frac{1885}{264} \]

We check if \( \frac{1885}{264} \) can be simplified further. The prime factors of 1885 are 5, 13, and 29, and the prime factors of 264 are 2, 2, 2, 3, and 11. There are no common factors other than 1.

To multiply these fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we already know the result of \((\frac{27}{6}) \times (\frac{25}{5})\) is 22.5.

Next, we need to calculate \(\frac{20}{27}\).

Now, we multiply 22.5 by \(\frac{20}{27}\):

\[ 22.5 \times \frac{20}{27} \]

To simplify this, we can convert 22.5 to a fraction:
\[ 22.5 = \frac{45}{2} \]

So the expression becomes:
\[ \frac{45}{2} \times \frac{20}{27} \]

Multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[ \frac{45 \times 20}{2 \times 27} = \frac{900}{54} \]

Now, simplify \(\frac{900}{54}\):
\[ \frac{900}{54} = \frac{50}{3} \]

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the product of the fractions \( \frac{25}{20} \) and \( \frac{11}{6} \), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{25}{20} \times \frac{11}{6} = \frac{25 \times 11}{20 \times 6}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
25 \times 11 = 275
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
20 \times 6 = 120
\]

So, the product is:

\[
\frac{275}{120}
\]

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 275 and 120. The prime factorization of 275 is \( 5^2 \times 11 \), and the prime factorization of 120 is \( 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 \). The common factor is 5.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 5:

\[
\frac{275 \div 5}{120 \div 5} = \frac{55}{24}

First, calculate the numerator:

Next, calculate the denominator:

So, the product is:

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1100 and 624. The prime factorization of 1100 is \( 2^2 \times 5^2 \times 11 \), and the prime factorization of 624 is \( 2^4 \times 3 \times 13 \). The common factor is \( 2^2 = 4 \).

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 4:

First, let's multiply the numerators:

Next, let's multiply the denominators:

So, the product of the fractions is:

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 435 and 432.

The prime factorization of 435 is:

The prime factorization of 432 is:

The common factor between 435 and 432 is 3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we start with the result from the previous multiplication:
\[ \frac{145}{144} \]

Now, we need to multiply this fraction by \( \frac{27}{4} \).

To multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

First, let's multiply the numerators:
\[ 145 \times 27 = 3915 \]

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
\[ 144 \times 4 = 576 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{3915}{576} \]

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3915 and 576.

The prime factorization of 3915 is:
\[ 3915 = 3 \times 5 \times 261 = 3 \times 5 \times 3 \times 87 = 3^2 \times 5 \times 29 \]

The prime factorization of 576 is:
\[ 576 = 2^6 \times 3^2 \]

The common factor between 3915 and 576 is \( 3^2 = 9 \).

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 9:
\[ \frac{3915 \div 9}{576 \div 9} = \frac{435}{64} \]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:
\[ \frac{435}{64} \]

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous problem, you calculated the multiplication of the fractions 15/16 and 29/27. Now, let's imagine that you initially had a fraction with 15 as the numerator and 10 as the denominator instead of 15/16. How would the result differ if you multiply 15/10 by 29/27? Give your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply the fractions \(\frac{15}{10}\) and \(\frac{29}{27}\), we follow the same process of multiplying the numerators and the denominators.

First, let's multiply the numerators:
\[ 15 \times 29 = 435 \]

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
\[ 10 \times 27 = 270 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{435}{270} \]

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 435 and 270.

The prime factorization of 435 is:
\[ 435 = 3 \times 5 \times 29 \]

The prime factorization of 270 is:
\[ 270 = 2 \times 3^3 \times 5 \]

The common factors between 435 and 270 are 3 and 5.

The GCD of 435 and 270 is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 15:
\[ \frac{435 \div 15}{270 \div 15} = \frac{29}{18} \]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:
\[ \frac{29}{18} \]

\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
27 \times 27 = 729
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
10 \times 3 = 30
\]

So, the product of the fractions is:

\[

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 729 and 30. The prime factorization of 729 is \(3^6\), and the prime factorization of 30 is \(2 \times 3 \times 5\). The only common factor is 3.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{729 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{243}{10}

So, the product of the fractions is:

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6561 and 600. The prime factorization of 6561 is \(3^8\), and the prime factorization of 600 is \(2^3 \times 3 \times 5^2\). The only common factor is 3.

Now, we need to simplify this fraction. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2380 and 363. 

Using the Euclidean algorithm:

            Previously, you evaluated ((20 / 22) * (14 / 11)) and multiplied the result by (17/3). Now consider changing the second fraction in the initial multiplication to (14 / 2). Now how does the expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 2)) differ from the original? Evaluate the new expression and write your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first evaluate the new expression \(\left(\frac{20}{22}\right) \times \left(\frac{14}{2}\right)\).

1. Simplify \(\frac{20}{22}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 22 is 2.
   - \(\frac{20}{22} = \frac{20 \div 2}{22 \div 2} = \frac{10}{11}\).

2. Simplify \(\frac{14}{2}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 and 2 is 2.
   - \(\frac{14}{2} = \frac{14 \div 2}{2 \div 2} = \frac{7}{1} = 7\).

Now, multiply the simplified fractions:
\[
\left(\frac{10}{11}\right) \times 7 = \frac{10 \times 7}{11 \times 1} = \frac{70}{11}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{70}{11}\) is already in its simplest form because 70 and 11 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate the expression \(\left(\frac{25}{8} \times \frac{3}{4}\right)\), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
   \[

2. Multiply the denominators together:
   \[

4. Simplify the fraction if possible. In this case, 75 and 32 have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the simplified fraction is \(\frac{75}{32}\).

Regarding the interpretation, the result \(\frac{75}{32}\) can signify a form of division or sharing. For example, if you have 75 units of something and you want to distribute them evenly among 32 groups, each group would receive \(\frac{75}{32}\) units. This fraction represents the portion each group gets.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of \(\left(\frac{75}{32} \times \frac{29}{23}\right)\), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
   \[
   75 \times 29 = 2175
   \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
   \[
   32 \times 23 = 736
   \]

3. Combine the results to form a single fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2175}{736}
   \]

4. Simplify the fraction if possible. We need to check if 2175 and 736 have any common factors. 

First, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2175 and 736. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

\[
2175 \div 736 \approx 2.955 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
2175 - 2 \times 736 = 2175 - 1472 = 703
\]

Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 736 and 703:

\[
736 \div 703 \approx 1.047 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
736 - 1 \times 703 = 736 - 703 = 33
\]

Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 703 and 33:

\[
703 \div 33 \approx 21.303 \quad \text{(integer part is 21)}
\]
\[
703 - 21 \times 33 = 703 - 693 = 10
\]

Next, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 33 and 10:

\[
33 \div 10 \approx 3.3 \quad \text{(integer part is 3)}
\]
\[
33 - 3 \times 10 = 33 - 30 = 3
\]

Finally, apply the Euclidean algorithm to 10 and 3:

\[
10 \div 3 \approx 3.333 \quad \text{(integer part is 3)}
\]
\[
10 - 3 \times 3 = 10 - 9 = 1
\]

Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \(\frac{2175}{736}\) is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the simplified fraction is \(\frac{2175}{736}\).

In terms of the original division or portion sharing scenario, this additional operation represents further distributing or scaling the portions. If \(\frac{75}{32}\) was the portion each group received initially, multiplying by \(\frac{29}{23}\) adjusts the portion size by a factor of \(\frac{29}{23}\), either increasing or decreasing the amount each group gets based on the value of the fraction.

            After solving the previous problem, now evaluate the new expression ((25 / 8) * (29 / 4)). This means we have changed the second fraction from (3 / 4) to (29 / 4).

Under the previous scenario where the fractions referred to sharing or dividing amongst a group, consider what would happen if the proportions you multiplied with were changed to this new ratio. 

Write the result of ((25 / 8) * (29 / 4)) as a simplified fraction and reflect on the impact of this change in the real-world scenario.

Thus, the simplified fraction is \(\frac{725}{32}\).

Reflecting on the real-world scenario, if the fractions represent sharing or dividing amongst a group, changing the second fraction from \(\frac{3}{4}\) to \(\frac{29}{4}\) significantly increases the amount being multiplied. This means that if you were distributing 25 units of something among 8 groups and then further dividing by 4 groups, the new ratio \(\frac{29}{4}\) would result in a much larger portion per group compared to the previous ratio \(\frac{3}{4}\). Essentially, each group would receive a larger share of the total units.

\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
29 \times 26 = 754
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
17 \times 15 = 255
\]

So, the product is:

\[
\frac{754}{255}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 754 and 255. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 754 by 255 and find the remainder:
\[
754 \div 255 \approx 2 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 754 - 2 \times 255 = 244

2. Divide 255 by 244 and find the remainder:
\[
255 \div 244 \approx 1 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 255 - 1 \times 244 = 11

3. Divide 244 by 11 and find the remainder:
\[
244 \div 11 \approx 22 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 244 - 22 \times 11 = 2

4. Divide 11 by 2 and find the remainder:
\[
11 \div 2 \approx 5 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 11 - 5 \times 2 = 1

5. Divide 2 by 1 and find the remainder:
\[
2 \div 1 \approx 2 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 2 - 2 \times 1 = 0

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 1. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{754}{255}\) is already in its simplest form.

First, calculate the numerator:

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
255 \times 9 = 2295
\]

So, the product is:

\[
\frac{15834}{2295}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15834 and 2295. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 15834 by 2295 and find the remainder:
\[
15834 \div 2295 \approx 6 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 15834 - 6 \times 2295 = 1954

5. Divide 249 by 92 and find the remainder:
\[
249 \div 92 \approx 2 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 249 - 2 \times 92 = 65

6. Divide 92 by 65 and find the remainder:
\[
92 \div 65 \approx 1 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 92 - 1 \times 65 = 27

7. Divide 65 by 27 and find the remainder:
\[
65 \div 27 \approx 2 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 65 - 2 \times 27 = 11

9. Divide 11 by 5 and find the remainder:

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
15 \times 26 = 390
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
17 \times 15 = 255
\]

So, the product is:

\[
\frac{390}{255}

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 390 and 255. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 390 by 255 and find the remainder:
\[

2. Divide 255 by 135 and find the remainder:

3. Divide 135 by 120 and find the remainder:

4. Divide 120 by 15 and find the remainder:
\[
120 \div 15 \approx 8 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 120 - 8 \times 15 = 0
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 15. Therefore, we can simplify the fraction \(\frac{390}{255}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 15:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of multiplying \(\frac{23}{4}\) by \(\frac{10}{12}\), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
   \[

2. Multiply the denominators together:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48

So, the product is:
\[

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 230 and 48.

- The prime factorization of 230 is \(2 \times 5 \times 23\).
- The prime factorization of 48 is \(2^4 \times 3\).

The common factor is 2.

Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 2:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the multiplication of the fractions \(\frac{21}{26} \times \frac{20}{9}\), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
\[ 21 \times 20 = 420 \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
\[ 26 \times 9 = 234 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{420}{234} \]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 420 and 234.

First, we find the prime factorizations of both numbers:
- The prime factorization of 420 is \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \)
- The prime factorization of 234 is \( 2 \times 3^2 \times 13 \)

The common prime factors are 2 and 3. Therefore, the GCD is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{420 \div 6}{234 \div 6} = \frac{70}{39} \]

Thus, the simplified form of the fraction is:

1. Multiply the numerators together:

\[ 26 \times 9 = 234 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:

Next, we simplify this fraction. We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 420 and 234.

The prime factorization of 420 is \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \).
The prime factorization of 234 is \( 2 \times 3^2 \times 13 \).

The common prime factors are 2 and 3. Therefore, the GCD is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{420 \div 6}{234 \div 6} = \frac{70}{39} \]

Thus, the simplified form of the fraction is:
\[ \frac{70}{39} \]

Next, we take this result and multiply it by the fraction \(\frac{15}{21}\).

1. Multiply the numerators together:
\[ 70 \times 15 = 1050 \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
\[ 39 \times 21 = 819 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{1050}{819} \]

Next, we simplify this fraction. We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1050 and 819.

The prime factorization of 1050 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \times 7 \).
The prime factorization of 819 is \( 3 \times 3 \times 7 \times 13 \).

The common prime factors are 3 and 7. Therefore, the GCD is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{1050 \div 21}{819 \div 21} = \frac{50}{39} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the multiplication of the fractions \(\frac{21}{26} \times \frac{20}{4}\), we follow these steps:

1. Simplify the second fraction \(\frac{20}{4}\):

So, the problem now becomes:

2. Multiply the numerator of the first fraction by 5:

3. The denominator remains the same:

Thus, the product of the fractions is:

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 105 and 26.

First, we find the prime factorizations of both numbers:
- The prime factorization of 105 is \( 3 \times 5 \times 7 \)
- The prime factorization of 26 is \( 2 \times 13 \)

Calculating the numerator:

\[
17 \times 15 = 255
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
13 \times 6 = 78
\]

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{255}{78}
\]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 255 and 78. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. \(255 \div 78 = 3\) with a remainder of \(255 - 3 \times 78 = 21\)
2. \(78 \div 21 = 3\) with a remainder of \(78 - 3 \times 21 = 15\)
3. \(21 \div 15 = 1\) with a remainder of \(21 - 1 \times 15 = 6\)
4. \(15 \div 6 = 2\) with a remainder of \(15 - 2 \times 6 = 3\)
5. \(6 \div 3 = 2\) with a remainder of \(6 - 2 \times 3 = 0\)

The GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 3.

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

Calculating the denominator:

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{680}{390}

Next, we need to simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 680 and 390. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. \(680 \div 390 = 1\) with a remainder of \(680 - 1 \times 390 = 290\)
2. \(390 \div 290 = 1\) with a remainder of \(390 - 1 \times 290 = 100\)

First, calculate the numerator:

Next, calculate the denominator:

So, the fraction is:

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 425 and 108. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 425 by 108 to get the remainder:
\[
425 \div 108 \approx 3 \quad \text{(remainder 101)}

2. Now, divide 108 by 101 to get the remainder:
\[
108 \div 101 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 7)}

3. Next, divide 101 by 7 to get the remainder:

            After calculating the result of the initial problem: (25 / 18) * (17 / 6), proceed to multiply your answer by the fraction (23 / 17). Write your final answer as a simplified fraction.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we start with the result of the initial problem:

\[
\left(\frac{25}{18}\right) \times \left(\frac{17}{6}\right) = \frac{425}{108}
\]

Next, we need to multiply this result by the fraction \(\frac{23}{17}\):

\[
\frac{425}{108} \times \frac{23}{17}
\]

We multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{425 \times 23}{108 \times 17}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
425 \times 23 = 9775
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
108 \times 17 = 1836
\]

So, the fraction is:

\[
\frac{9775}{1836}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9775 and 1836. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 9775 by 1836 to get the remainder:
\[
9775 \div 1836 \approx 5 \quad \text{(remainder 1595)}
\]

2. Now, divide 1836 by 1595 to get the remainder:
\[
1836 \div 1595 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 241)}
\]

3. Next, divide 1595 by 241 to get the remainder:
\[
1595 \div 241 \approx 6 \quad \text{(remainder 149)}
\]

4. Then, divide 241 by 149 to get the remainder:
\[
241 \div 149 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 92)}
\]

5. Next, divide 149 by 92 to get the remainder:
\[
149 \div 92 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 57)}
\]

6. Then, divide 92 by 57 to get the remainder:
\[
92 \div 57 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 35)}
\]

7. Next, divide 57 by 35 to get the remainder:
\[
57 \div 35 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 22)}
\]

8. Then, divide 35 by 22 to get the remainder:
\[
35 \div 22 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 13)}
\]

9. Next, divide 22 by 13 to get the remainder:
\[
22 \div 13 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 9)}
\]

10. Then, divide 13 by 9 to get the remainder:
\[
13 \div 9 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 4)}
\]

11. Next, divide 9 by 4 to get the remainder:
\[
9 \div 4 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}
\]

12. Finally, divide 4 by 1 to get the remainder:
\[
4 \div 1 = 4 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 1. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{9775}{1836}\) is already in its simplest form.

            After initially calculating the result of the problem: (25 / 18) * (17 / 6), let's consider a change.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the updated equation \(\left(\frac{25}{18}\right) \times \left(\frac{14}{6}\right)\), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{25 \times 14}{18 \times 6}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
25 \times 14 = 350
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
18 \times 6 = 108
\]

So, the fraction is:

\[
\frac{350}{108}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 350 and 108. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 350 by 108 to get the remainder:
\[
350 \div 108 \approx 3 \quad \text{(remainder 26)}
\]

2. Now, divide 108 by 26 to get the remainder:
\[
108 \div 26 \approx 4 \quad \text{(remainder 4)}
\]

3. Next, divide 26 by 4 to get the remainder:
\[
26 \div 4 \approx 6 \quad \text{(remainder 2)}
\]

4. Then, divide 4 by 2 to get the remainder:
\[
4 \div 2 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 2. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[
\frac{350 \div 2}{108 \div 2} = \frac{175}{54}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's start by calculating the new expression step by step:

\[
(16 / 5) * (5 / 7)
\]

We can multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{16 \times 5}{5 \times 7}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction by canceling out the common factor of 5 in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{16 \times 5}{5 \times 7} = \frac{16}{7}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the multiplication of the fractions \(\frac{8}{3} \times \frac{18}{21}\), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
   \[
   8 \times 18 = 144
   \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
   \[
   3 \times 21 = 63

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[
\frac{144}{63}
\]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 144 and 63.

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 144: \(2^4 \times 3^2\)
- 63: \(3^2 \times 7\)

The common factors are \(3^2\), so the GCD is \(3^2 = 9\).

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{144 \div 9}{63 \div 9} = \frac{16}{7}

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

2. Multiply the denominators together:

First, we find the prime factorizations:

Next, multiply the denominators:

So, the product of the fractions is:

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 400 and 78. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

1. Divide 400 by 78 and find the remainder:

2. Now, divide 78 by the remainder 10:
\[ 78 \div 10 = 7 \text{ remainder } 8 \]
3. Next, divide 10 by the remainder 8:

4. Finally, divide 8 by the remainder 2:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">The result of the previous problem was \(\frac{13}{11}\). We need to square this fraction.

To square a fraction, we square both the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\left(\frac{13}{11}\right)^2 = \frac{13^2}{11^2}
\]

Calculate the squares:
\[
13^2 = 169

\[
11^2 = 121

So, we have:
\[
\left(\frac{13}{11}\right)^2 = \frac{169}{121}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem \((\frac{16}{12}) * (\frac{26}{22})\), we first simplify each fraction individually.

1. Simplify \(\frac{16}{12}\):
We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 16 and 12, which is 4. We then divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{16}{12} = \frac{16 \div 4}{12 \div 4} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

2. Simplify \(\frac{26}{22}\):
We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 26 and 22, which is 2. We then divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{26}{22} = \frac{26 \div 2}{22 \div 2} = \frac{13}{11}
\]

Now, we multiply the simplified fractions:
\[
\frac{4}{3} * \frac{13}{11} = \frac{4 * 13}{3 * 11} = \frac{52}{33}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{52}{33}\) is already in its simplest form since 52 and 33 have no common factors other than 1.

To multiply these fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the fraction resulting from the multiplication of \(\frac{16}{6}\) and \(\frac{29}{27}\), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators:
\[
16 \times 29 = 464
\]

2. Multiply the denominators:
\[
6 \times 27 = 162
\]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[
\frac{464}{162}
\]

Next, we simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 464 and 162. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

First, divide 464 by 162 and find the remainder:
\[
464 \div 162 \approx 2 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 464 - 2 \times 162 = 464 - 324 = 140
\]

Next, divide 162 by 140:
\[
162 \div 140 \approx 1 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 162 - 1 \times 140 = 162 - 140 = 22
\]

Next, divide 140 by 22:
\[
140 \div 22 \approx 6 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 140 - 6 \times 22 = 140 - 132 = 8
\]

Next, divide 22 by 8:
\[
22 \div 8 \approx 2 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 22 - 2 \times 8 = 22 - 16 = 6
\]

Next, divide 8 by 6:
\[
8 \div 6 \approx 1 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 8 - 1 \times 6 = 8 - 6 = 2
\]

Finally, divide 6 by 2:
\[
6 \div 2 \approx 3 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 6 - 3 \times 2 = 6 - 6 = 0
\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD of 464 and 162 is 2.

Now, we simplify \(\frac{464}{162}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 2:
\[
\frac{464 \div 2}{162 \div 2} = \frac{232}{81}

Thus, the fraction in simplest form is:

1. Multiply the numerators:

\]

2. Multiply the denominators:
\[
6 \times 10 = 60
\]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[

\]

Next, we simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 464 and 60. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

First, divide 464 by 60 and find the remainder:
\[
464 \div 60 \approx 7 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 464 - 7 \times 60 = 464 - 420 = 44

Next, divide 60 by 44:
\[
60 \div 44 \approx 1 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 60 - 1 \times 44 = 60 - 44 = 16

Next, divide 44 by 16:
\[
44 \div 16 \approx 2 \quad \text{(quotient)} \quad \text{remainder} = 44 - 2 \times 16 = 44 - 32 = 12

Next, divide 16 by 12:

\[

\]

Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD of 464 and 60 is 4.

Now, we simplify \(\frac{464}{60}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 4:
\[
\frac{464 \div 4}{60 \div 4} = \frac{116}{15}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem \(\frac{29}{10} \div \frac{18}{16}\), we can use the property of division of fractions, which states that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.

First, we find the reciprocal of \(\frac{18}{16}\):
\[
\text{Reciprocal of } \frac{18}{16} = \frac{16}{18}
\]

Next, we multiply \(\frac{29}{10}\) by \(\frac{16}{18}\):
\[
\frac{29}{10} \times \frac{16}{18}
\]

We multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
\[
\frac{29 \times 16}{10 \times 18} = \frac{464}{180}
\]

Now, we need to simplify the fraction \(\frac{464}{180}\). We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 464 and 180. 

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 464: \(2^4 \times 29\)
- 180: \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5\)

The common factors are \(2^2\), so the GCD is \(2^2 = 4\).

We divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{464 \div 4}{180 \div 4} = \frac{116}{45}

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

            Suppose you took the result of the previous problem ((29 / 10) / (18 / 16)) and then you further multiplied this result by (8 / 17). Calculate this new result and express your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We start with the result from the previous problem, which is \(\frac{116}{45}\). We need to multiply this by \(\frac{8}{17}\):

\[
\frac{116}{45} \times \frac{8}{17}
\]

We multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{116 \times 8}{45 \times 17} = \frac{928}{765}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{928}{765}\). We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 928 and 765.

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 928: \(2^4 \times 58\)
- 765: \(3 \times 5 \times 17\)

Since there are no common prime factors between 928 and 765, the GCD is 1.

Thus, the fraction \(\frac{928}{765}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem of multiplying \(\frac{15}{12}\) by \(\frac{27}{3}\), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
\[ 15 \times 27 = 405 \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
\[ 12 \times 3 = 36 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{405}{36} \]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 405 and 36.

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 405: \( 405 = 5 \times 3^4 \)
- 36: \( 36 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \)

The common prime factor is \(3\), and the lowest power of \(3\) in both factorizations is \(3^2\).

Thus, the GCD is:
\[ 3^2 = 9 \]

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{405 \div 9}{36 \div 9} = \frac{45}{4} \]

So, the simplified fraction is:
\[ \frac{45}{4} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem of multiplying \(\frac{45}{4}\) by \(\frac{22}{14}\), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators together:
\[ 45 \times 22 = 990 \]

2. Multiply the denominators together:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{990}{56} \]

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 990 and 56.

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 990: \( 990 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 11 \)
- 56: \( 56 = 2^3 \times 7 \)

The common prime factor is \(2\), and the lowest power of \(2\) in both factorizations is \(2\).

Thus, the GCD is:
\[ 2 \]

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{990 \div 2}{56 \div 2} = \frac{495}{28} \]

Next, we check if \(\frac{495}{28}\) can be simplified further. We need to find the GCD of 495 and 28.

Prime factorizations:
- 495: \( 495 = 3^2 \times 5 \times 11 \)
- 28: \( 28 = 2^2 \times 7 \)

There are no common prime factors between 495 and 28, so the fraction \(\frac{495}{28}\) is already in its simplest form.

1. Multiply the numerators together:

\[ 12 \times 5 = 60 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:

Next, we need to simplify this fraction. We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 405 and 60.

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 405: \( 405 = 5 \times 3^4 \)

The common prime factors are \(3\) and \(5\), and the lowest power of each common factor is:

Thus, the GCD is:
