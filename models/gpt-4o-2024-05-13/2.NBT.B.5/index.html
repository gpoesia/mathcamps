The farmer collected 9 oranges from the first tree and 38 oranges from the second tree.

So, we add these two amounts together:

Performing the addition:
\[ 9 + 38 = 47 \]

Therefore, the total number of oranges the farmer collected is 47.

Adding these together:

John initially had $53 in his wallet. He spent an amount that left him with $39 less than what he initially had.

So, we calculate the remaining amount as follows:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Amount spent} \]

Given that the amount spent is $39 less than the initial amount:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 53 - 39 \]

Performing the subtraction:
\[ 53 - 39 = 14 \]

Therefore, John has $14 left in his wallet after buying the book.

Next, we know that 95 starfish were washed ashore by the tempest.

To find out how many more starfish need to be rescued from the shore to have an equal number from both places, we need to compare the number of starfish found in the ocean (94) with the number washed ashore (95).

Since 95 starfish were washed ashore and 94 were found in the ocean, the difference is:
95 - 94 = 1

Therefore, they need to rescue 1 more starfish from the shore to have saved an equal number from both places.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how many beads Sarah has left after making the first bracelet. She started with 56 beads and used 37 of them:

\[ 56 - 37 = 19 \]

So, Sarah has 19 beads left.

Next, we need to find out how many more beads she needs to complete the second bracelet, which requires 84 beads. Since she already has 19 beads, we subtract this from the total needed:

\[ 84 - 19 = 65 \]

Therefore, Sarah needs to buy 65 more beads to complete the second bracelet.

\[ 52 - 42 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 pairs of sunglasses left in stock after the sale.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the correct number of pairs of sunglasses left in stock after the sale, we need to subtract the revised number of pairs sold from the initial stock.

Initial stock of sunglasses: 52 pairs

            In the previous problem, Alex began with 85 scooters in his garage. But what if, initially, Alex had only 87 scooters instead of 85 in his collection? After selling the 46 scooters to the fellow enthusiasts, then how many scooters would Alex have remaining in his collection?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many scooters Alex would have remaining if he initially had 87 scooters and sold 46, we need to subtract the number of scooters sold from the initial number of scooters.

Starting with:
- Initial number of scooters: 87
- Number of scooters sold: 46

We perform the subtraction:
\[ 87 - 46 = 41 \]

Thus, if Alex initially had 87 scooters and sold 46, he would have 41 scooters remaining in his collection.

Initially, Ben had 54 notes. After his sister took 24 notes, he was left with:
\[ 54 - 24 = 30 \]

According to the problem, after retrieving some notes, Ben has the same number of notes as he initially had minus the number of notes he had after his sister's prank. This can be written as:
\[ 54 - (30 - x) = 54 - 30 + x \]

Since Ben now has the same number of notes as he initially did minus the ones he had after his sister's prank, we set up the equation:
\[ 54 - 30 + x = 54 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 24 + x = 54 \]
