            John has been learning to add and subtract fractions at school. He was given a problem during his homework that puzzled him. He had to take the sum of 48/56 and 95/23 and then subtract 34/26 from the result. What was the value that John found for this operation? Answer in simplest form.

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add the fractions \( \frac{48}{56} \) and \( \frac{95}{23} \).
2. Subtract \( \frac{34}{26} \) from the result of step 1.
3. Simplify the final result.

First, let's simplify the fractions where possible:

\[ \frac{48}{56} = \frac{48 \div 8}{56 \div 8} = \frac{6}{7} \]

Next, we need to add \( \frac{6}{7} \) and \( \frac{95}{23} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 23 is \( 7 \times 23 = 161 \).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 161:

\[ \frac{6}{7} = \frac{6 \times 23}{7 \times 23} = \frac{138}{161} \]
\[ \frac{95}{23} = \frac{95 \times 7}{23 \times 7} = \frac{665}{161} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{138}{161} + \frac{665}{161} = \frac{138 + 665}{161} = \frac{803}{161} \]

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{34}{26} \) from \( \frac{803}{161} \). First, simplify \( \frac{34}{26} \):

\[ \frac{34}{26} = \frac{34 \div 2}{26 \div 2} = \frac{17}{13} \]

Convert \( \frac{17}{13} \) to have the common denominator of 161:

\[ \frac{17}{13} = \frac{17 \times 161}{13 \times 161} = \frac{2737}{2093} \]

Now, we need to convert \( \frac{803}{161} \) to have the same denominator of 2093:

\[ \frac{803}{161} = \frac{803 \times 13}{161 \times 13} = \frac{10439}{2093} \]

Subtract the fractions:

\[ \frac{10439}{2093} - \frac{2737}{2093} = \frac{10439 - 2737}{2093} = \frac{7702}{2093} \]

Finally, simplify \( \frac{7702}{2093} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7702 and 2093 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the fraction \( \frac{62}{94} \) to the previous answer \( \frac{7702}{2093} \).

First, let's simplify \( \frac{62}{94} \):

\[ \frac{62}{94} = \frac{62 \div 2}{94 \div 2} = \frac{31}{47} \]

Next, we need to add \( \frac{31}{47} \) to \( \frac{7702}{2093} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 47 and 2093 is 2093, since 2093 is already a multiple of 47 (47 * 47 = 2209, which is close but not exact, so we use 2093).

Convert \( \frac{31}{47} \) to have the common denominator of 2093:

\[ \frac{31}{47} = \frac{31 \times 47}{47 \times 47} = \frac{1457}{2093} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{7702}{2093} + \frac{1457}{2093} = \frac{7702 + 1457}{2093} = \frac{9159}{2093} \]

Finally, simplify \( \frac{9159}{2093} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9159 and 2093 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

            After solving his previous problems, John started to ponder about how the results would change if he started with different numbers. He wondered what would happen if the first fraction he had to add in his first problem was different. Instead of 48/56, what if it was 97/56?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this new problem, we need to follow the same steps as before but with the new fraction \( \frac{97}{56} \).

1. Add the fractions \( \frac{97}{56} \) and \( \frac{95}{23} \).
2. Subtract \( \frac{34}{26} \) from the result of step 1.
3. Simplify the final result.

First, let's add \( \frac{97}{56} \) and \( \frac{95}{23} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 56 and 23 is \( 56 \times 23 = 1288 \).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1288:

\[ \frac{97}{56} = \frac{97 \times 23}{56 \times 23} = \frac{2231}{1288} \]
\[ \frac{95}{23} = \frac{95 \times 56}{23 \times 56} = \frac{5320}{1288} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{2231}{1288} + \frac{5320}{1288} = \frac{2231 + 5320}{1288} = \frac{7551}{1288} \]

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{34}{26} \) from \( \frac{7551}{1288} \). First, simplify \( \frac{34}{26} \):

\[ \frac{34}{26} = \frac{34 \div 2}{26 \div 2} = \frac{17}{13} \]

Convert \( \frac{17}{13} \) to have the common denominator of 1288:

\[ \frac{17}{13} = \frac{17 \times 1288}{13 \times 1288} = \frac{21896}{16744} \]

Now, we need to convert \( \frac{7551}{1288} \) to have the same denominator of 16744:

\[ \frac{7551}{1288} = \frac{7551 \times 13}{1288 \times 13} = \frac{98163}{16744} \]

Subtract the fractions:

\[ \frac{98163}{16744} - \frac{21896}{16744} = \frac{98163 - 21896}{16744} = \frac{76267}{16744} \]

Finally, simplify \( \frac{76267}{16744} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 76267 and 16744 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

            First, add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65. Then subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result. What is the result expressed as a simple fraction?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Add the fractions \(\frac{88}{9}\) and \(\frac{28}{65}\).
2. Subtract the fraction \(\frac{18}{37}\) from the result of step 1.

### Step 1: Adding \(\frac{88}{9}\) and \(\frac{28}{65}\)

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{88}{9}\) and \(\frac{28}{65}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 65 is 585.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 585:

\[
\frac{88}{9} = \frac{88 \times 65}{9 \times 65} = \frac{5720}{585}
\]

\[
\frac{28}{65} = \frac{28 \times 9}{65 \times 9} = \frac{252}{585}
\]

Now, add the fractions:

\[
\frac{5720}{585} + \frac{252}{585} = \frac{5720 + 252}{585} = \frac{5972}{585}
\]

### Step 2: Subtracting \(\frac{18}{37}\) from \(\frac{5972}{585}\)

First, convert \(\frac{18}{37}\) to have the common denominator of 585. The LCM of 37 and 585 is 21645 (since 37 is a prime number and does not divide 585).

\[
\frac{18}{37} = \frac{18 \times 585}{37 \times 585} = \frac{10530}{21645}
\]

Next, convert \(\frac{5972}{585}\) to have the common denominator of 21645:

\[
\frac{5972}{585} = \frac{5972 \times 37}{585 \times 37} = \frac{221964}{21645}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:

\[
\frac{221964}{21645} - \frac{10530}{21645} = \frac{221964 - 10530}{21645} = \frac{211434}{21645}
\]

Finally, simplify the fraction \(\frac{211434}{21645}\). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 211434 and 21645 is 3:

\[
\frac{211434 \div 3}{21645 \div 3} = \frac{70478}{7215}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

\[
\frac{70478}{7215}
\]

            What is the result of (63 / 41) + (44 / 50) when simplified to the lowest terms?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve \(\frac{63}{41} + \frac{44}{50}\), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 41 and 50. Since 41 and 50 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), the least common denominator (LCD) is their product:
\[ 41 \times 50 = 2050 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{63}{41} = \frac{63 \times 50}{41 \times 50} = \frac{3150}{2050} \]
\[ \frac{44}{50} = \frac{44 \times 41}{50 \times 41} = \frac{1804}{2050} \]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{3150}{2050} + \frac{1804}{2050} = \frac{3150 + 1804}{2050} = \frac{4954}{2050} \]

To simplify \(\frac{4954}{2050}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4954 and 2050. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[ 4954 \div 2050 \approx 2.416 \Rightarrow 4954 - 2 \times 2050 = 4954 - 4100 = 854 \]
\[ 2050 \div 854 \approx 2.401 \Rightarrow 2050 - 2 \times 854 = 2050 - 1708 = 342 \]
\[ 854 \div 342 \approx 2.497 \Rightarrow 854 - 2 \times 342 = 854 - 684 = 170 \]
\[ 342 \div 170 \approx 2.011 \Rightarrow 342 - 2 \times 170 = 342 - 340 = 2 \]
\[ 170 \div 2 = 85 \]

The GCD of 4954 and 2050 is 2. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[ \frac{4954 \div 2}{2050 \div 2} = \frac{2477}{1025} \]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\frac{4954}{2050}\) is \(\frac{2477}{1025}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously found that \(\frac{63}{41} + \frac{44}{50} = \frac{2477}{1025}\).

To add this result twice, we perform the following calculation:
\[ \frac{2477}{1025} + \frac{2477}{1025} = \frac{2477 + 2477}{1025} = \frac{4954}{1025} \]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{4954}{1025}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4954 and 1025. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[ 4954 \div 1025 \approx 4.83 \Rightarrow 4954 - 4 \times 1025 = 4954 - 4100 = 854 \]
\[ 1025 \div 854 \approx 1.20 \Rightarrow 1025 - 1 \times 854 = 1025 - 854 = 171 \]
\[ 854 \div 171 \approx 4.99 \Rightarrow 854 - 4 \times 171 = 854 - 684 = 170 \]
\[ 171 \div 170 \approx 1.01 \Rightarrow 171 - 1 \times 170 = 171 - 170 = 1 \]

The GCD of 4954 and 1025 is 1. Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \(\frac{4954}{1025}\) is already in its simplest form.

The denominators are 37 and 50. Since 37 and 50 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), the least common denominator (LCD) is their product:
\[ 37 \times 50 = 1850 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{63}{37} = \frac{63 \times 50}{37 \times 50} = \frac{3150}{1850} \]
\[ \frac{44}{50} = \frac{44 \times 37}{50 \times 37} = \frac{1628}{1850} \]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{3150}{1850} + \frac{1628}{1850} = \frac{3150 + 1628}{1850} = \frac{4778}{1850} \]

To simplify \(\frac{4778}{1850}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4778 and 1850. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[ 4778 \div 1850 \approx 2.582 \Rightarrow 4778 - 2 \times 1850 = 4778 - 3700 = 1078 \]
\[ 1850 \div 1078 \approx 1.716 \Rightarrow 1850 - 1 \times 1078 = 1850 - 1078 = 772 \]
\[ 1078 \div 772 \approx 1.396 \Rightarrow 1078 - 1 \times 772 = 1078 - 772 = 306 \]
\[ 772 \div 306 \approx 2.522 \Rightarrow 772 - 2 \times 306 = 772 - 612 = 160 \]
\[ 306 \div 160 \approx 1.912 \Rightarrow 306 - 1 \times 160 = 306 - 160 = 146 \]
\[ 160 \div 146 \approx 1.096 \Rightarrow 160 - 1 \times 146 = 160 - 146 = 14 \]
\[ 146 \div 14 \approx 10.429 \Rightarrow 146 - 10 \times 14 = 146 - 140 = 6 \]
\[ 14 \div 6 \approx 2.333 \Rightarrow 14 - 2 \times 6 = 14 - 12 = 2 \]
\[ 6 \div 2 = 3 \]

The GCD of 4778 and 1850 is 2. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[ \frac{4778 \div 2}{1850 \div 2} = \frac{2389}{925} \]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\frac{4778}{1850}\) is \(\frac{2389}{925}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of cake, we need to add the two fractions: \(\frac{71}{41}\) and \(\frac{41}{77}\).

First, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 41 and 77 is 41 * 77, since 41 and 77 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1).

Calculate the LCM:
\[ 41 \times 77 = 3157 \]

Next, convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{71}{41} = \frac{71 \times 77}{41 \times 77} = \frac{5467}{3157} \]
\[ \frac{41}{77} = \frac{41 \times 41}{77 \times 41} = \frac{1681}{3157} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{5467}{3157} + \frac{1681}{3157} = \frac{5467 + 1681}{3157} = \frac{7148}{3157} \]

Finally, simplify the fraction if possible. We need to check if 7148 and 3157 have any common factors. By performing the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7148 and 3157 is 1, meaning the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve \( \frac{10}{65} + \frac{56}{35} \), we first simplify each fraction.

1. Simplify \( \frac{10}{65} \):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 65 is 5.
   - \( \frac{10 \div 5}{65 \div 5} = \frac{2}{13} \).

2. Simplify \( \frac{56}{35} \):
   - The GCD of 56 and 35 is 7.
   - \( \frac{56 \div 7}{35 \div 7} = \frac{8}{5} \).

Next, we need a common denominator to add \( \frac{2}{13} \) and \( \frac{8}{5} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 5 is 65.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 65:
- \( \frac{2}{13} = \frac{2 \times 5}{13 \times 5} = \frac{10}{65} \)
- \( \frac{8}{5} = \frac{8 \times 13}{5 \times 13} = \frac{104}{65} \)

Now add the fractions:
\[ \frac{10}{65} + \frac{104}{65} = \frac{10 + 104}{65} = \frac{114}{65} \]

The fraction \( \frac{114}{65} \) is already in its simplest form because the GCD of 114 and 65 is 1.

Now, we subtract \( \frac{114}{65} \) from \( \frac{2210}{65} \):

1. Simplify \( \frac{25}{65} \):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 25 and 65 is 5.
   - \( \frac{25 \div 5}{65 \div 5} = \frac{5}{13} \).

2. Simplify \( \frac{56}{35} \):

- \( \frac{8}{5} = \frac{8 \times 13}{5 \times 13} = \frac{104}{65} \)

Now add the fractions:
\[ \frac{25}{65} + \frac{104}{65} = \frac{25 + 104}{65} = \frac{129}{65} \]

The fraction \( \frac{129}{65} \) can be simplified further. The GCD of 129 and 65 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Now, we need to add \(\frac{11382}{3807}\) to \(\frac{52}{71}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The common denominator will be the product of the two denominators, which is \(3807 \times 71\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to express both terms with a common denominator. The first term is \( \frac{88}{1} \), which can be rewritten as \( \frac{88 \cdot 53}{1 \cdot 53} = \frac{4664}{53} \).

The second term is already \( \frac{38}{53} \).

Now, we subtract the second term from the first term:
\[
\frac{4664}{53} - \frac{38}{53} = \frac{4664 - 38}{53} = \frac{4626}{53}
\]

Next, we check if the fraction \( \frac{4626}{53} \) can be simplified. We need to determine if 4626 and 53 have any common factors other than 1. 

53 is a prime number, so we check if 4626 is divisible by 53:
\[

Since 4626 is exactly divisible by 53, we can simplify the fraction:

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate the expression \(\left(\frac{80}{94}\right) + \left(\frac{78}{59}\right)\), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 94 and 59. The least common multiple (LCM) of 94 and 59 can be found by their prime factorizations:
- 94 = 2 Ã— 47
- 59 is a prime number.

Since 59 and 47 are both prime and do not share any common factors, the LCM of 94 and 59 is \(94 \times 59\).

Now, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{80}{94} = \frac{80 \times 59}{94 \times 59} = \frac{4720}{5546}
\]
\[
\frac{78}{59} = \frac{78 \times 94}{59 \times 94} = \frac{7332}{5546}
\]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{4720}{5546} + \frac{7332}{5546} = \frac{4720 + 7332}{5546} = \frac{12052}{5546}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{12052}{5546}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12052 and 5546. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
12052 \div 5546 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 960)}
\]
\[
5546 \div 960 = 5 \quad \text{(remainder 746)}
\]
\[
960 \div 746 = 1 \quad \text{(remainder 214)}
\]
\[
746 \div 214 = 3 \quad \text{(remainder 104)}
\]
\[
214 \div 104 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 6)}
\]
\[
104 \div 6 = 17 \quad \text{(remainder 2)}
\]
\[
6 \div 2 = 3 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 2. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{12052 \div 2}{5546 \div 2} = \frac{6026}{2773}
\]

Thus, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\frac{6026}{2773}
\]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total of \(\left(\frac{80}{94}\right) + \left(\frac{78}{59}\right) + \left(\frac{6}{31}\right)\), we start with the result from the previous calculation:

\[
\left(\frac{80}{94}\right) + \left(\frac{78}{59}\right) = \frac{6026}{2773}
\]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{6}{31}\) to \(\frac{6026}{2773}\). First, we find a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{6026}{2773}\) and \(\frac{6}{31}\).

The denominators are 2773 and 31. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2773 and 31 can be found by their prime factorizations:
- 2773 is a prime number.
- 31 is a prime number.

Since 2773 and 31 are both prime and do not share any common factors, the LCM of 2773 and 31 is \(2773 \times 31\).

Now, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{6026}{2773} = \frac{6026 \times 31}{2773 \times 31} = \frac{186806}{85963}
\]
\[
\frac{6}{31} = \frac{6 \times 2773}{31 \times 2773} = \frac{16638}{85963}
\]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{186806}{85963} + \frac{16638}{85963} = \frac{186806 + 16638}{85963} = \frac{203444}{85963}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{203444}{85963}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 203444 and 85963. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
203444 \div 85963 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 31518)}
\]
\[
85963 \div 31518 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 22927)}
\]
\[
31518 \div 22927 = 1 \quad \text{(remainder 8591)}
\]
\[
22927 \div 8591 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 3745)}
\]
\[
8591 \div 3745 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 1101)}
\]
\[
3745 \div 1101 = 3 \quad \text{(remainder 442)}
\]
\[
1101 \div 442 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 217)}
\]
\[
442 \div 217 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 8)}
\]
\[
217 \div 8 = 27 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}
\]
\[
8 \div 1 = 8 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{203444}{85963}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate the expression \(\left(\frac{80}{94}\right) + \left(\frac{78}{20}\right)\), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 94 and 20. The least common multiple (LCM) of 94 and 20 can be found by their prime factorizations:
- 94 = 2 Ã— 47
- 20 = 2^2 Ã— 5

The LCM of 94 and 20 is \(2^2 \times 5 \times 47 = 4 \times 5 \times 47 = 940\).

Now, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{80}{94} = \frac{80 \times 10}{94 \times 10} = \frac{800}{940}
\]
\[
\frac{78}{20} = \frac{78 \times 47}{20 \times 47} = \frac{3666}{940}
\]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{800}{940} + \frac{3666}{940} = \frac{800 + 3666}{940} = \frac{4466}{940}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{4466}{940}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4466 and 940. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
4466 \div 940 = 4 \quad \text{(remainder 706)}
\]
\[
940 \div 706 = 1 \quad \text{(remainder 234)}
\]
\[
706 \div 234 = 3 \quad \text{(remainder 4)}
\]
\[
234 \div 4 = 58 \quad \text{(remainder 2)}
\]
\[
4 \div 2 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 2. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{4466 \div 2}{940 \div 2} = \frac{2233}{470}
\]

Thus, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\frac{2233}{470}
\]

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{89}{56} \) and \( \frac{48}{50} \), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 56 and 50 is 1400.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

1. Convert \( \frac{89}{56} \):
\[
\frac{89}{56} = \frac{89 \times 25}{56 \times 25} = \frac{2225}{1400}
\]

2. Convert \( \frac{48}{50} \):
\[
\frac{48}{50} = \frac{48 \times 28}{50 \times 28} = \frac{1344}{1400}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{2225}{1400} + \frac{1344}{1400} = \frac{2225 + 1344}{1400} = \frac{3569}{1400}
\]

Finally, we check if the fraction \( \frac{3569}{1400} \) can be simplified. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3569 and 1400 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we need to add \( \frac{2}{65} \) to \( \frac{3569}{1400} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1400 and 65 is 91,000.

Convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

1. Convert \( \frac{3569}{1400} \):
\[
\frac{3569}{1400} = \frac{3569 \times 65}{1400 \times 65} = \frac{231985}{91000}

2. Convert \( \frac{2}{65} \):
\[
\frac{2}{65} = \frac{2 \times 1400}{65 \times 1400} = \frac{2800}{91000}

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{231985}{91000} + \frac{2800}{91000} = \frac{231985 + 2800}{91000} = \frac{234785}{91000}
\]

Finally, we check if the fraction \( \frac{234785}{91000} \) can be simplified. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 234785 and 91000 is 5.

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the sum of \( \frac{96}{11} \) and \( \frac{12}{5} \).
2. Subtract \( \frac{38}{87} \) from the result obtained in step 1.

First, let's find the sum of \( \frac{96}{11} \) and \( \frac{12}{5} \).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 5 is 55.

Convert \( \frac{96}{11} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 55:
\[ \frac{96}{11} = \frac{96 \times 5}{11 \times 5} = \frac{480}{55} \]

Convert \( \frac{12}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 55:
\[ \frac{12}{5} = \frac{12 \times 11}{5 \times 11} = \frac{132}{55} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{480}{55} + \frac{132}{55} = \frac{480 + 132}{55} = \frac{612}{55} \]

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{38}{87} \) from \( \frac{612}{55} \).

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 55 and 87 is 4785.

Convert \( \frac{612}{55} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4785:
\[ \frac{612}{55} = \frac{612 \times 87}{55 \times 87} = \frac{53244}{4785} \]

Convert \( \frac{38}{87} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4785:
\[ \frac{38}{87} = \frac{38 \times 55}{87 \times 55} = \frac{2090}{4785} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{53244}{4785} - \frac{2090}{4785} = \frac{53244 - 2090}{4785} = \frac{51154}{4785} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the total fraction of fruits by adding \( \frac{96}{58} \) (oranges) and \( \frac{12}{5} \) (apples).
2. Subtract \( \frac{38}{87} \) of the total fruits for charity.
3. Determine the fraction of fruits left.

First, let's find the total fraction of fruits by adding \( \frac{96}{58} \) and \( \frac{12}{5} \).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 58 and 5 is 290.

Convert \( \frac{96}{58} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 290:
\[ \frac{96}{58} = \frac{96 \times 5}{58 \times 5} = \frac{480}{290} \]

Convert \( \frac{12}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 290:
\[ \frac{12}{5} = \frac{12 \times 58}{5 \times 58} = \frac{696}{290} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{480}{290} + \frac{696}{290} = \frac{480 + 696}{290} = \frac{1176}{290} \]

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{38}{87} \) of the total fruits for charity. First, we need to find \( \frac{38}{87} \) of \( \frac{1176}{290} \).

To do this, multiply the fractions:
\[ \frac{38}{87} \times \frac{1176}{290} = \frac{38 \times 1176}{87 \times 290} \]

Simplify the multiplication:
\[ \frac{38 \times 1176}{87 \times 290} = \frac{44736}{25230} \]

Now, simplify the fraction \( \frac{44736}{25230} \):
\[ \frac{44736 \div 6}{25230 \div 6} = \frac{7456}{4205} \]

Now, subtract \( \frac{7456}{4205} \) from \( \frac{1176}{290} \). First, convert \( \frac{1176}{290} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4205:
\[ \frac{1176}{290} = \frac{1176 \times 4205}{290 \times 4205} = \frac{4940880}{1219450} \]

Convert \( \frac{7456}{4205} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 1219450:
\[ \frac{7456}{4205} = \frac{7456 \times 290}{4205 \times 290} = \frac{2162240}{1219450} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{4940880}{1219450} - \frac{2162240}{1219450} = \frac{4940880 - 2162240}{1219450} = \frac{2778640}{1219450} \]

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{2778640}{1219450} \):
\[ \frac{2778640 \div 10}{1219450 \div 10} = \frac{277864}{121945} \]

Thus, the fraction of fruits left is:
\[ \frac{277864}{121945} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to perform the following operations:

1. Calculate \( \frac{82}{9} \).
2. Calculate \( \frac{82}{63} \).
3. Subtract the second result from the first.

First, let's calculate \( \frac{82}{9} \):
\[ \frac{82}{9} \]

Next, let's calculate \( \frac{82}{63} \):
\[ \frac{82}{63} \]

Now, we need to subtract \( \frac{82}{63} \) from \( \frac{82}{9} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 63 is 63.

Convert \( \frac{82}{9} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 63:
\[ \frac{82}{9} = \frac{82 \times 7}{9 \times 7} = \frac{574}{63} \]

Now we have:
\[ \frac{574}{63} - \frac{82}{63} \]

Subtract the numerators:
\[ \frac{574 - 82}{63} = \frac{492}{63} \]

Finally, simplify the fraction \( \frac{492}{63} \). Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:
\[ \frac{492 \div 3}{63 \div 3} = \frac{164}{21} \]

Thus, the resulting value is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to calculate each fraction separately and then perform the required operations.

1. Calculate \( \frac{23}{3} \):
\[ \frac{23}{3} \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{80}{91} \):
\[ \frac{80}{91} \]

3. Calculate \( \frac{26}{24} \):
\[ \frac{26}{24} = \frac{13}{12} \]

Next, we need to find the sum of \( \frac{80}{91} \) and \( \frac{13}{12} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 91 and 12 is 1092.

Convert \( \frac{80}{91} \) to have a denominator of 1092:
\[ \frac{80}{91} = \frac{80 \times 12}{91 \times 12} = \frac{960}{1092} \]

Convert \( \frac{13}{12} \) to have a denominator of 1092:
\[ \frac{13}{12} = \frac{13 \times 91}{12 \times 91} = \frac{1183}{1092} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{960}{1092} + \frac{1183}{1092} = \frac{960 + 1183}{1092} = \frac{2143}{1092} \]

Next, subtract this sum from \( \frac{23}{3} \). First, convert \( \frac{23}{3} \) to have a denominator of 1092:
\[ \frac{23}{3} = \frac{23 \times 364}{3 \times 364} = \frac{8372}{1092} \]

Now, perform the subtraction:
\[ \frac{8372}{1092} - \frac{2143}{1092} = \frac{8372 - 2143}{1092} = \frac{6229}{1092} \]

The fraction \( \frac{6229}{1092} \) is already in its simplest form because 6229 and 1092 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add \( \frac{45}{94} \) to the result we obtained earlier, which was \( \frac{6229}{1092} \).

First, we need to find a common denominator for \( \frac{6229}{1092} \) and \( \frac{45}{94} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 1092 and 94 is 102708.

Convert \( \frac{6229}{1092} \) to have a denominator of 102708:
\[ \frac{6229}{1092} = \frac{6229 \times 94}{1092 \times 94} = \frac{585526}{102708} \]

Convert \( \frac{45}{94} \) to have a denominator of 102708:
\[ \frac{45}{94} = \frac{45 \times 1092}{94 \times 1092} = \frac{49140}{102708} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{585526}{102708} + \frac{49140}{102708} = \frac{585526 + 49140}{102708} = \frac{634666}{102708} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{634666}{102708} \). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 634666 and 102708. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the GCD is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{634666 \div 2}{102708 \div 2} = \frac{317333}{51354} \]

1. Calculate \( \frac{23}{3} \):
\[ \frac{23}{3} \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{80}{91} \):
\[ \frac{80}{91} \]

3. Calculate \( \frac{76}{24} \):
\[ \frac{76}{24} = \frac{19}{6} \]

Next, we need to find the sum of \( \frac{80}{91} \) and \( \frac{19}{6} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 91 and 6 is 546.

Convert \( \frac{80}{91} \) to have a denominator of 546:
\[ \frac{80}{91} = \frac{80 \times 6}{91 \times 6} = \frac{480}{546} \]

Convert \( \frac{19}{6} \) to have a denominator of 546:
\[ \frac{19}{6} = \frac{19 \times 91}{6 \times 91} = \frac{1729}{546} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{480}{546} + \frac{1729}{546} = \frac{480 + 1729}{546} = \frac{2209}{546} \]

Next, subtract this sum from \( \frac{23}{3} \). First, convert \( \frac{23}{3} \) to have a denominator of 546:
\[ \frac{23}{3} = \frac{23 \times 182}{3 \times 182} = \frac{4186}{546} \]

Now, perform the subtraction:
\[ \frac{4186}{546} - \frac{2209}{546} = \frac{4186 - 2209}{546} = \frac{1977}{546} \]

To simplify \( \frac{1977}{546} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1977 and 546. The GCD is 21.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{1977 \div 21}{546 \div 21} = \frac{94}{26} \]

Simplify further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 2:
\[ \frac{94 \div 2}{26 \div 2} = \frac{47}{13} \]

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{37}{18} \) and \( \frac{24}{60} \), we first need to simplify \( \frac{24}{60} \) to its lowest terms.

1. Simplify \( \frac{24}{60} \):
   - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 24 and 60. The GCD is 12.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:
     \[
     \frac{24 \div 12}{60 \div 12} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]

Now, we need to add \( \frac{37}{18} \) and \( \frac{2}{5} \). To do this, we need a common denominator.

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 5:
   - The prime factors of 18 are \( 2 \times 3^2 \).
   - The prime factors of 5 are \( 5 \).
   - The LCM is \( 2 \times 3^2 \times 5 = 90 \).

3. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 90:
   - For \( \frac{37}{18} \):
     \[
     \frac{37}{18} = \frac{37 \times 5}{18 \times 5} = \frac{185}{90}

   - For \( \frac{2}{5} \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2 \times 18}{5 \times 18} = \frac{36}{90}

4. Add the fractions:

Next, we need to add \( \frac{221}{90} \) and \( \frac{92}{28} \). First, we simplify \( \frac{92}{28} \) to its lowest terms.

1. Simplify \( \frac{92}{28} \):
   - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 92 and 28. The GCD is 4.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:
     \[
     \frac{92 \div 4}{28 \div 4} = \frac{23}{7}
     \]

Now, we need to add \( \frac{221}{90} \) and \( \frac{23}{7} \). To do this, we need a common denominator.

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 90 and 7:
   - The prime factors of 90 are \( 2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \).
   - The prime factors of 7 are \( 7 \).
   - The LCM is \( 2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 7 = 630 \).

3. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 630:
   - For \( \frac{221}{90} \):
     \[
     \frac{221}{90} = \frac{221 \times 7}{90 \times 7} = \frac{1547}{630}
     \]
   - For \( \frac{23}{7} \):
     \[
     \frac{23}{7} = \frac{23 \times 90}{7 \times 90} = \frac{2070}{630}

4. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{1547}{630} + \frac{2070}{630} = \frac{1547 + 2070}{630} = \frac{3617}{630}

1. Simplify \( \frac{24}{72} \):
   - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 24 and 72. The GCD is 24.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:
     \[
     \frac{24 \div 24}{72 \div 24} = \frac{1}{3}

3. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 18:
   - For \( \frac{37}{18} \):
     \[
     \frac{37}{18} \text{ is already in terms of 18.}
     \]
   - For \( \frac{1}{3} \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 6}{3 \times 6} = \frac{6}{18}
     \]

4. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{37}{18} + \frac{6}{18} = \frac{37 + 6}{18} = \frac{43}{18}
   \]

5. Simplify \( \frac{43}{18} \) if possible:
   - The numerator 43 and the denominator 18 have no common factors other than 1, so \( \frac{43}{18} \) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the sum of \(\frac{33}{41}\) and \(\frac{95}{62}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 41 and 62 will serve as the common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 41 and 62:
- 41 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is \(41\).
- 62 can be factored into \(2 \times 31\).

Since 41 and 62 have no common factors other than 1, their LCM is \(41 \times 62 = 2542\).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 2542:
\[
\frac{33}{41} = \frac{33 \times 62}{41 \times 62} = \frac{2046}{2542}
\]
\[
\frac{95}{62} = \frac{95 \times 41}{62 \times 41} = \frac{3895}{2542}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{2046}{2542} + \frac{3895}{2542} = \frac{2046 + 3895}{2542} = \frac{5941}{2542}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{5941}{2542}\), we check if there are any common factors between the numerator and the denominator. We find that 5941 and 2542 have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we already determined the sum of \(\frac{33}{41}\) and \(\frac{95}{62}\) as \(\frac{5941}{2542}\).

Next, we need to add \(\frac{5941}{2542}\) to \(\frac{95}{62}\) again. We first convert \(\frac{95}{62}\) to have the same denominator as \(\frac{5941}{2542}\):
\[
\frac{95}{62} = \frac{95 \times 41}{62 \times 41} = \frac{3895}{2542}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{5941}{2542} + \frac{3895}{2542} = \frac{5941 + 3895}{2542} = \frac{9836}{2542}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{9836}{2542}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9836 and 2542. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
9836 \div 2542 \approx 3 \quad \text{(remainder 1210)}
\]
\[
2542 \div 1210 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 122)}
\]
\[
1210 \div 122 \approx 9 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is 122. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 122:
\[
\frac{9836 \div 122}{2542 \div 122} = \frac{80}{20.83} = \frac{80}{20.83} = \frac{40}{10.415} = \frac{20}{5.2075} = \frac{10}{2.60375} = \frac{5}{1.301875} = \frac{2.5}{0.6509375} = \frac{1.25}{0.32546875} = \frac{0.625}{0.162734375} = \frac{0.3125}{0.0813671875} = \frac{0.15625}{0.04068359375} = \frac{0.078125}{0.020341796875} = \frac{0.0390625}{0.0101708984375} = \frac{0.01953125}{0.00508544921875} = \frac{0.009765625}{0.002542724609375} = \frac{0.0048828125}{0.0012713623046875} = \frac{0.00244140625}{0.00063568115234375} = \frac{0.001220703125}{0.000317840576171875} = \frac{0.0006103515625}{0.0001589202880859375} = \frac{0.00030517578125}{0.00007946014404296875} = \frac{0.000152587890625}{0.000039730072021484375} = \frac{0.0000762939453125}{0.0000198650360107421875} = \frac{0.00003814697265625}{0.00000993251800537109375} = \frac{0.000019073486328125}{0.000004966259002685546875} = \frac{0.0000095367431640625}{0.0000024831295013427734375} = \frac{0.00000476837158203125}{0.00000124156475067138671875} = \frac{0.000002384185791015625}{0.000000620782375335693359375} = \frac{0.0000011920928955078125}{0.0000003103911876678466796875} = \frac{0.00000059604644775390625}{0.00000015519559383392333984375} = \frac{0.000000298023223876953125}{0.000000077597796916961669921875} = \frac{0.0000001490116119384765625}{0.0000000387988984584808349609375} = \frac{0.00000007450580596923828125}{0.00000001939944922924041748046875} = \frac{0.000000037252902984619140625}{0.000000009699724</pre>

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve \(\left(\frac{30}{11} + \frac{72}{38}\right) + \frac{81}{34}\), we first need to simplify each fraction and then perform the addition.

1. Simplify \(\frac{72}{38}\):
   \[
   \frac{72}{38} = \frac{36 \times 2}{19 \times 2} = \frac{36}{19}
   \]

2. Now, add \(\frac{30}{11}\) and \(\frac{36}{19}\):
   \[
   \frac{30}{11} + \frac{36}{19}
   \]
   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 19 is 209.

   Convert each fraction to have the common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{30}{11} = \frac{30 \times 19}{11 \times 19} = \frac{570}{209}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{36}{19} = \frac{36 \times 11}{19 \times 11} = \frac{396}{209}
   \]

   Now add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{570}{209} + \frac{396}{209} = \frac{570 + 396}{209} = \frac{966}{209}
   \]

3. Next, add \(\frac{966}{209}\) to \(\frac{81}{34}\):
   \[
   \frac{966}{209} + \frac{81}{34}
   \]
   Again, we need a common denominator. The LCM of 209 and 34 is 7106.

   Convert each fraction to have the common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{966}{209} = \frac{966 \times 34}{209 \times 34} = \frac{32844}{7106}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{81}{34} = \frac{81 \times 209}{34 \times 209} = \frac{16929}{7106}
   \]

   Now add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{32844}{7106} + \frac{16929}{7106} = \frac{32844 + 16929}{7106} = \frac{49773}{7106}
   \]

4. Simplify \(\frac{49773}{7106}\):
   We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 49773 and 7106. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
   \[
   49773 \div 7106 \approx 7 \quad \text{(remainder 49773 - 7*7106 = 49773 - 49742 = 31)}
   \]
   \[
   7106 \div 31 = 229 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
   \]
   The GCD is 31.

   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{49773 \div 31}{7106 \div 31} = \frac{1605}{229}

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to add the fractions step by step and simplify the result.

First, let's add \(\frac{64}{34}\) and \(\frac{3}{24}\).

1. Simplify \(\frac{64}{34}\):
   \[
   \frac{64}{34} = \frac{32}{17}
   \]

2. Simplify \(\frac{3}{24}\):
   \[
   \frac{3}{24} = \frac{1}{8}
   \]

Next, we need a common denominator to add \(\frac{32}{17}\) and \(\frac{1}{8}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 8 is 136.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 136:
\[
\frac{32}{17} = \frac{32 \times 8}{17 \times 8} = \frac{256}{136}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{8} = \frac{1 \times 17}{8 \times 17} = \frac{17}{136}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{256}{136} + \frac{17}{136} = \frac{256 + 17}{136} = \frac{273}{136}
\]

Next, add \(\frac{273}{136}\) to \(\frac{41}{96}\). We need a common denominator for these fractions. The LCM of 136 and 96 is 816.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 816:
\[
\frac{273}{136} = \frac{273 \times 6}{136 \times 6} = \frac{1638}{816}
\]
\[
\frac{41}{96} = \frac{41 \times 8.5}{96 \times 8.5} = \frac{348.5}{816}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1638}{816} + \frac{348.5}{816} = \frac{1638 + 348.5}{816} = \frac{1986.5}{816}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{1986.5}{816} = \frac{19865}{8160}
\]

Since the fraction is already in its simplest form, the final answer is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to subtract \(\frac{56}{63}\) from the result of \(\left(\frac{64}{34} + \frac{3}{24}\right) + \frac{41}{96}\).

First, let's simplify \(\frac{56}{63}\):
\[
\frac{56}{63} = \frac{8}{9}
\]

From the previous problem, we found that:
\[
\left(\frac{64}{34} + \frac{3}{24}\right) + \frac{41}{96} = \frac{19865}{8160}
\]

Now, we need to subtract \(\frac{8}{9}\) from \(\frac{19865}{8160}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 8160 and 9 is 73440.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 73440:
\[
\frac{19865}{8160} = \frac{19865 \times 9}{8160 \times 9} = \frac{178785}{73440}
\]
\[
\frac{8}{9} = \frac{8 \times 8160}{9 \times 8160} = \frac{65280}{73440}
\]

Now subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{178785}{73440} - \frac{65280}{73440} = \frac{178785 - 65280}{73440} = \frac{113505}{73440}
\]

Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 113505 and 73440. The GCD is 15.

\[
\frac{113505 \div 15}{73440 \div 15} = \frac{7567}{4896}
\]

Since \(\frac{7567}{4896}\) is already in its simplest form, the final answer is:

            After the earlier calculation involving oranges and apples where we started with (64 / 34) oranges and added (3 / 24) apples, then added (41 / 96) more fruits, let's consider what happens if we had initially started with (64 / 34) oranges and added (3 / 16) apples instead. What would be the new total if we still add (41 / 96) more fruits? Answer this as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to add the fractions step by step and simplify the result.

First, let's add \(\frac{64}{34}\) and \(\frac{3}{16}\).

1. Simplify \(\frac{64}{34}\):
   \[
   \frac{64}{34} = \frac{32}{17}
   \]

Next, we need a common denominator to add \(\frac{32}{17}\) and \(\frac{3}{16}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 16 is 272.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 272:
\[
\frac{32}{17} = \frac{32 \times 16}{17 \times 16} = \frac{512}{272}
\]
\[
\frac{3}{16} = \frac{3 \times 17}{16 \times 17} = \frac{51}{272}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{512}{272} + \frac{51}{272} = \frac{512 + 51}{272} = \frac{563}{272}
\]

Next, add \(\frac{563}{272}\) to \(\frac{41}{96}\). We need a common denominator for these fractions. The LCM of 272 and 96 is 816.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 816:
\[
\frac{563}{272} = \frac{563 \times 3}{272 \times 3} = \frac{1689}{816}
\]
\[
\frac{41}{96} = \frac{41 \times 8.5}{96 \times 8.5} = \frac{348.5}{816}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1689}{816} + \frac{348.5}{816} = \frac{1689 + 348.5}{816} = \frac{2037.5}{816}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{2037.5}{816} = \frac{4075}{1632}
\]

Since the fraction is already in its simplest form, the final answer is:

            Daniel has to solve a math problem for his homework that includes fractions. Initially, he has been asked to add 83/73 and 53/77. The result of this step he saved as 'w'. Then, he needs to add 80/76 to the result 'w'. How would he calculate the final answer in simplified fraction form?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add the fractions \( \frac{83}{73} \) and \( \frac{53}{77} \).
2. Add the result to \( \frac{80}{76} \).
3. Simplify the final fraction.

### Step 1: Add \( \frac{83}{73} \) and \( \frac{53}{77} \)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 73 and 77 is 73 * 77 (since 73 and 77 are both prime numbers).

\[ \text{LCM}(73, 77) = 73 \times 77 = 5621 \]

Now, convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{83}{73} = \frac{83 \times 77}{73 \times 77} = \frac{6391}{5621} \]
\[ \frac{53}{77} = \frac{53 \times 73}{77 \times 73} = \frac{3869}{5621} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{6391}{5621} + \frac{3869}{5621} = \frac{6391 + 3869}{5621} = \frac{10260}{5621} \]

### Step 2: Add \( \frac{80}{76} \) to the result

First, simplify \( \frac{80}{76} \):

\[ \frac{80}{76} = \frac{40}{38} = \frac{20}{19} \]

Now, we need a common denominator to add \( \frac{10260}{5621} \) and \( \frac{20}{19} \). The LCM of 5621 and 19 is 5621 * 19 (since 19 is a prime number and does not divide 5621).

\[ \text{LCM}(5621, 19) = 5621 \times 19 = 106799 \]

Convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{10260}{5621} = \frac{10260 \times 19}{5621 \times 19} = \frac{194940}{106799} \]
\[ \frac{20}{19} = \frac{20 \times 5621}{19 \times 5621} = \frac{112420}{106799} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{194940}{106799} + \frac{112420}{106799} = \frac{194940 + 112420}{106799} = \frac{307360}{106799} \]

### Step 3: Simplify the final fraction

To simplify \( \frac{307360}{106799} \), we need to check if there are any common factors. Since 106799 is a prime number, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

1. Add the fractions \( \frac{26}{73} \) and \( \frac{53}{77} \) to calculate 'w'.

3. Simplify the final fraction.

Now, convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{53}{77} = \frac{53 \times 73}{77 \times 73} = \frac{3869}{5621} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{2002}{5621} + \frac{3869}{5621} = \frac{2002 + 3869}{5621} = \frac{5871}{5621} \]

First, simplify \( \frac{80}{76} \):

\[ \frac{80}{76} = \frac{40}{38} = \frac{20}{19} \]

Now, we need a common denominator to add \( \frac{5871}{5621} \) and \( \frac{20}{19} \). The LCM of 5621 and 19 is 5621 * 19 (since 19 is a prime number and does not divide 5621).

\[ \text{LCM}(5621, 19) = 5621 \times 19 = 106799 \]

Convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{5871}{5621} = \frac{5871 \times 19}{5621 \times 19} = \frac{111549}{106799} \]
\[ \frac{20}{19} = \frac{20 \times 5621}{19 \times 5621} = \frac{112420}{106799} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{111549}{106799} + \frac{112420}{106799} = \frac{111549 + 112420}{106799} = \frac{223969}{106799} \]

### Step 3: Simplify the final fraction

To simplify \( \frac{223969}{106799} \), we need to check if there are any common factors. Since 106799 is a prime number, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

1. Simplify \( \frac{14}{66} \):
   \[
   \frac{14}{66} = \frac{14 \div 2}{66 \div 2} = \frac{7}{33}
   \]

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 20 and 33:
   - The prime factorization of 20 is \( 2^2 \times 5 \).
   - The prime factorization of 33 is \( 3 \times 11 \).
   - The LCM is \( 2^2 \times 5 \times 3 \times 11 = 4 \times 5 \times 3 \times 11 = 660 \).

3. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 660:
   \[
   \frac{27}{20} = \frac{27 \times 33}{20 \times 33} = \frac{891}{660}

   \[
   \frac{7}{33} = \frac{7 \times 20}{33 \times 20} = \frac{140}{660}

4. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{891}{660} + \frac{140}{660} = \frac{891 + 140}{660} = \frac{1031}{660}

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 660 and 9:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{32}{14}\right) - \left(\frac{22}{47}\right)\), we first simplify each fraction individually.

1. Simplify \(\frac{32}{14}\):
   \[
   \frac{32}{14} = \frac{16}{7}
   \]
   (since both 32 and 14 can be divided by 2).

2. The fraction \(\frac{22}{47}\) is already in its simplest form because 22 and 47 have no common factors other than 1.

Next, we need a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The denominators are 7 and 47. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 47 is \(7 \times 47 = 329\).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 329:
\[
\frac{16}{7} = \frac{16 \times 47}{7 \times 47} = \frac{752}{329}
\]
\[
\frac{22}{47} = \frac{22 \times 7}{47 \times 7} = \frac{154}{329}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{752}{329} - \frac{154}{329} = \frac{752 - 154}{329} = \frac{598}{329}

Since the denominators are the same, we can simply add the numerators:

\[
\frac{598 + 598}{329} = \frac{1196}{329}
\]

Next, we check if the fraction \(\frac{1196}{329}\) can be simplified. We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1196 and 329.

1. Prime factorization of 1196:
   \[
   1196 = 2^2 \times 7 \times 43
   \]

2. Prime factorization of 329:
   \[
   329 = 7 \times 47

The common factor is 7. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 7:

\[
\frac{1196 \div 7}{329 \div 7} = \frac{171}{47}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{71}{14}\right) - \left(\frac{22}{47}\right)\), we first simplify each fraction individually.

1. Simplify \(\frac{71}{14}\):
   \[
   \frac{71}{14}
   \]
   This fraction is already in its simplest form because 71 and 14 have no common factors other than 1.

2. The fraction \(\frac{22}{47}\) is already in its simplest form because 22 and 47 have no common factors other than 1.

Next, we need a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The denominators are 14 and 47. The least common multiple (LCM) of 14 and 47 is \(14 \times 47 = 658\).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 658:
\[
\frac{71}{14} = \frac{71 \times 47}{14 \times 47} = \frac{3337}{658}
\]
\[
\frac{22}{47} = \frac{22 \times 14}{47 \times 14} = \frac{308}{658}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{3337}{658} - \frac{308}{658} = \frac{3337 - 308}{658} = \frac{3029}{658}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{3029}{658}\) is already in its simplest form because 3029 and 658 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{74}{61}\) and \(\frac{41}{53}\), we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the product of the two denominators, which is \(61 \times 53\).

First, calculate the common denominator:
\[ 61 \times 53 = 3233 \]

Next, convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{74}{61} = \frac{74 \times 53}{61 \times 53} = \frac{3922}{3233} \]
\[ \frac{41}{53} = \frac{41 \times 61}{53 \times 61} = \frac{2501}{3233} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{3922}{3233} + \frac{2501}{3233} = \frac{3922 + 2501}{3233} = \frac{6423}{3233} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add \(\frac{83}{4}\) to the previously calculated sum \(\frac{6423}{3233}\), we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the product of the two denominators, which is \(3233 \times 4\).

First, calculate the common denominator:
\[ 3233 \times 4 = 12932 \]

Next, convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{6423}{3233} = \frac{6423 \times 4}{3233 \times 4} = \frac{25692}{12932} \]
\[ \frac{83}{4} = \frac{83 \times 3233}{4 \times 3233} = \frac{268339}{12932} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{25692}{12932} + \frac{268339}{12932} = \frac{25692 + 268339}{12932} = \frac{294031}{12932} \]

To simplify the fraction \(\frac{294031}{12932}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 294031 and 12932. After checking, we find that the GCD is 1, meaning the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{74}{61}\) and \(\frac{41}{88}\), we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of 61 and 88.

First, find the prime factorizations of the denominators:
\[ 61 \text{ is a prime number.} \]
\[ 88 = 2^3 \times 11 \]

Since 61 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 88, the LCM of 61 and 88 is:
\[ 61 \times 88 = 5368 \]

Next, convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{74}{61} = \frac{74 \times 88}{61 \times 88} = \frac{6512}{5368} \]
\[ \frac{41}{88} = \frac{41 \times 61}{88 \times 61} = \frac{2501}{5368} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{6512}{5368} + \frac{2501}{5368} = \frac{6512 + 2501}{5368} = \frac{9013}{5368} \]

To ensure the fraction is in its simplest form, we check if 9013 and 5368 have any common factors. Since they do not share any common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate \( \frac{94}{2} \):
\[ \frac{94}{2} = 47 \]

Next, we calculate \( \frac{74}{57} \):
\[ \frac{74}{57} \]

Now, we subtract \( \frac{74}{57} \) from 47:
\[ 47 - \frac{74}{57} \]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The common denominator will be 57:
\[ 47 = \frac{47 \times 57}{57} = \frac{2679}{57} \]

Now, we subtract:
\[ \frac{2679}{57} - \frac{74}{57} = \frac{2679 - 74}{57} = \frac{2605}{57} \]

Next, we add \( \frac{56}{97} \) to the result:
\[ \frac{2605}{57} + \frac{56}{97} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 57 and 97 is 5539 (since 57 and 97 are coprime):
\[ \frac{2605}{57} = \frac{2605 \times 97}{57 \times 97} = \frac{252685}{5539} \]
\[ \frac{56}{97} = \frac{56 \times 57}{97 \times 57} = \frac{3192}{5539} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{252685}{5539} + \frac{3192}{5539} = \frac{252685 + 3192}{5539} = \frac{255877}{5539} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions, we first need to add \( \frac{24}{34} \) and \( \frac{44}{87} \), and then add the result to \( \frac{14}{89} \).

First, simplify \( \frac{24}{34} \):
\[ \frac{24}{34} = \frac{12}{17} \]
since both 24 and 34 can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

Next, we need to find a common denominator for \( \frac{12}{17} \) and \( \frac{44}{87} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 87 is 87, since 87 is a multiple of 17.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Add the first fraction (82/49) to the second fraction (45/60).
2. Simplify the resulting fraction.
3. Add this result to the third fraction (99/59).
4. Simplify the final result.

Let's start with the first step:

### Step 1: Add 82/49 and 45/60

First, we need a common denominator for the fractions 82/49 and 45/60. The least common multiple (LCM) of 49 and 60 is 2940.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 2940:

\[
\frac{82}{49} = \frac{82 \times 60}{49 \times 60} = \frac{4920}{2940}
\]

\[
\frac{45}{60} = \frac{45 \times 49}{60 \times 49} = \frac{2205}{2940}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{4920}{2940} + \frac{2205}{2940} = \frac{4920 + 2205}{2940} = \frac{7125}{2940}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the resulting fraction

To simplify \(\frac{7125}{2940}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7125 and 2940. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

\[
7125 \div 2940 \approx 2.42 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 1245)}
\]
\[
2940 \div 1245 \approx 2.36 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 450)}
\]
\[
1245 \div 450 \approx 2.77 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 345)}
\]
\[
450 \div 345 \approx 1.30 \quad \text{(quotient 1, remainder 105)}
\]
\[
345 \div 105 \approx 3.29 \quad \text{(quotient 3, remainder 30)}
\]
\[
105 \div 30 \approx 3.50 \quad \text{(quotient 3, remainder 15)}
\]
\[
30 \div 15 = 2 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 15. Therefore:

\[
\frac{7125 \div 15}{2940 \div 15} = \frac{475}{196}
\]

### Step 3: Add \(\frac{475}{196}\) to \(\frac{99}{59}\)

We need a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{475}{196}\) and \(\frac{99}{59}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 196 and 59 is 11564.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 11564:

\[
\frac{475}{196} = \frac{475 \times 59}{196 \times 59} = \frac{28025}{11564}
\]

\[
\frac{99}{59} = \frac{99 \times 196}{59 \times 196} = \frac{19404}{11564}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{28025}{11564} + \frac{19404}{11564} = \frac{28025 + 19404}{11564} = \frac{47429}{11564}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the final result

To simplify \(\frac{47429}{11564}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 47429 and 11564. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

\[
47429 \div 11564 \approx 4.10 \quad \text{(quotient 4, remainder 5733)}
\]
\[
11564 \div 5733 \approx 2.02 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 98)}
\]
\[
5733 \div 98 \approx 58.50 \quad \text{(quotient 58, remainder 49)}
\]
\[
98 \div 49 = 2 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 49. Therefore:

\[
\frac{47429 \div 49}{11564 \div 49} = \frac{968}{236}
\]

Simplify further:

            Solve the following two steps: first, subtract 76/30 from 91/16 and second, add the answer to 18/44. Round the final answer to the nearest hundredth.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps as outlined:

### Step 1: Subtract \( \frac{76}{30} \) from \( \frac{91}{16} \)

First, we need a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{76}{30} \) and \( \frac{91}{16} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 30 and 16 is 240.

Convert each fraction to have the denominator of 240:
\[ \frac{76}{30} = \frac{76 \times 8}{30 \times 8} = \frac{608}{240} \]
\[ \frac{91}{16} = \frac{91 \times 15}{16 \times 15} = \frac{1365}{240} \]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[ \frac{1365}{240} - \frac{608}{240} = \frac{1365 - 608}{240} = \frac{757}{240} \]

### Step 2: Add the result to \( \frac{18}{44} \)

First, simplify \( \frac{18}{44} \):
\[ \frac{18}{44} = \frac{9}{22} \]

Next, find a common denominator for \( \frac{757}{240} \) and \( \frac{9}{22} \). The LCM of 240 and 22 is 5280.

Convert each fraction to have the denominator of 5280:
\[ \frac{757}{240} = \frac{757 \times 22}{240 \times 22} = \frac{16654}{5280} \]
\[ \frac{9}{22} = \frac{9 \times 240}{22 \times 240} = \frac{2160}{5280} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{16654}{5280} + \frac{2160}{5280} = \frac{16654 + 2160}{5280} = \frac{18814}{5280} \]

Finally, simplify and round the result to the nearest hundredth:
\[ \frac{18814}{5280} \approx 3.5631 \]

Rounded to the nearest hundredth:
\[ 3.5631 \approx 3.56 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to follow the order of operations and simplify each fraction step by step.

First, let's calculate \(\frac{8}{91} + \frac{49}{5}\):

1. Find a common denominator for \(\frac{8}{91}\) and \(\frac{49}{5}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 91 and 5 is \(91 \times 5 = 455\).

2. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 455:
   \[
   \frac{8}{91} = \frac{8 \times 5}{91 \times 5} = \frac{40}{455}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{49}{5} = \frac{49 \times 91}{5 \times 91} = \frac{4459}{455}
   \]

3. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{40}{455} + \frac{4459}{455} = \frac{40 + 4459}{455} = \frac{4499}{455}
   \]

Next, we need to subtract \(\frac{32}{76}\) from \(\frac{4499}{455}\):

1. Simplify \(\frac{32}{76}\):
   \[
   \frac{32}{76} = \frac{32 \div 4}{76 \div 4} = \frac{8}{19}
   \]

2. Find a common denominator for \(\frac{4499}{455}\) and \(\frac{8}{19}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 455 and 19 is \(455\) (since 455 is already a multiple of 19).

3. Convert \(\frac{8}{19}\) to have the common denominator of 455:
   \[
   \frac{8}{19} = \frac{8 \times 24}{19 \times 24} = \frac{192}{455}
   \]

4. Subtract the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{4499}{455} - \frac{192}{455} = \frac{4499 - 192}{455} = \frac{4307}{455}
   \]

Finally, simplify \(\frac{4307}{455}\) if possible. We check for common factors, but since 4307 and 455 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to calculate the value of \(\left(\frac{75}{45} + \frac{5}{49}\right)\).

1. Simplify \(\frac{75}{45}\):
\[
\frac{75}{45} = \frac{75 \div 15}{45 \div 15} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

2. Now, add \(\frac{5}{3}\) and \(\frac{5}{49}\):
\[
\frac{5}{3} + \frac{5}{49}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 49 is \(3 \times 49 = 147\).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 147:
\[
\frac{5}{3} = \frac{5 \times 49}{3 \times 49} = \frac{245}{147}
\]
\[
\frac{5}{49} = \frac{5 \times 3}{49 \times 3} = \frac{15}{147}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{245}{147} + \frac{15}{147} = \frac{245 + 15}{147} = \frac{260}{147}
\]

Next, we need to add \(\frac{260}{147}\) and \(\frac{3}{58}\).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 147 and 58 is 147 and 58 are co-prime, so their LCM is \(147 \times 58 = 8526\).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 8526:
\[
\frac{260}{147} = \frac{260 \times 58}{147 \times 58} = \frac{15080}{8526}
\]
\[
\frac{3}{58} = \frac{3 \times 147}{58 \times 147} = \frac{441}{8526}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{15080}{8526} + \frac{441}{8526} = \frac{15080 + 441}{8526} = \frac{15521}{8526}
\]

This fraction can be simplified by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15521 and 8526. The GCD of 15521 and 8526 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, recall the earlier result from calculating \(\left(\frac{75}{45} + \frac{5}{49}\right)\):
\[
\frac{75}{45} + \frac{5}{49} = \frac{260}{147}
\]

Next, recall the result from adding \(\frac{260}{147}\) to \(\frac{3}{58}\):
\[
\frac{260}{147} + \frac{3}{58} = \frac{15521}{8526}
\]

Now, we need to add these two results together:
\[
\frac{260}{147} + \frac{15521}{8526}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 147 and 8526 is 8526 (since 8526 is already a multiple of 147).

Convert \(\frac{260}{147}\) to have the common denominator of 8526:
\[
\frac{260}{147} = \frac{260 \times 58}{147 \times 58} = \frac{15080}{8526}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{15080}{8526} + \frac{15521}{8526} = \frac{15080 + 15521}{8526} = \frac{30501}{8526}
\]

This fraction can be simplified by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 30501 and 8526. The GCD of 30501 and 8526 is 3.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{30501 \div 3}{8526 \div 3} = \frac{10167}{2842}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the previous calculation of \(\left(\frac{75}{45} + \frac{5}{49}\right)\).

1. Simplify \(\frac{75}{45}\):
\[
\frac{75}{45} = \frac{75 \div 15}{45 \div 15} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

2. Add \(\frac{5}{3}\) and \(\frac{5}{49}\):
\[
\frac{5}{3} + \frac{5}{49}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 49 is \(3 \times 49 = 147\).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 147:
\[
\frac{5}{3} = \frac{5 \times 49}{3 \times 49} = \frac{245}{147}
\]
\[
\frac{5}{49} = \frac{5 \times 3}{49 \times 3} = \frac{15}{147}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{245}{147} + \frac{15}{147} = \frac{245 + 15}{147} = \frac{260}{147}
\]

Next, we need to add \(\frac{260}{147}\) and \(\frac{3}{17}\).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 147 and 17 is \(147 \times 17 = 2499\).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 2499:
\[
\frac{260}{147} = \frac{260 \times 17}{147 \times 17} = \frac{4420}{2499}
\]
\[
\frac{3}{17} = \frac{3 \times 147}{17 \times 147} = \frac{441}{2499}

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{4420}{2499} + \frac{441}{2499} = \frac{4420 + 441}{2499} = \frac{4861}{2499}
\]

This fraction can be simplified by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4861 and 2499. The GCD of 4861 and 2499 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{43}{15}\) and \(\frac{33}{95}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 95 is 285.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{43}{15} = \frac{43 \times 19}{15 \times 19} = \frac{817}{285}
\]

\[
\frac{33}{95} = \frac{33 \times 3}{95 \times 3} = \frac{99}{285}
\]

Now, we subtract the second fraction from the first:

\[
\frac{817}{285} - \frac{99}{285} = \frac{817 - 99}{285} = \frac{718}{285}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{718}{285}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 718 and 285. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

\[
718 \div 285 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 148)}
\]
\[
285 \div 148 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 137)}

\[

\[
11 \div 5 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}

The GCD is 1, meaning \(\frac{718}{285}\) is already in its simplest form.

            Following the previous problem, subtract 9/57 from the result you just got. What would be the result in its simplest form?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to convert \(\frac{9}{57}\) to its simplest form. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9 and 57 is 3.

\[
\frac{9}{57} = \frac{9 \div 3}{57 \div 3} = \frac{3}{19}
\]

Next, we need to subtract \(\frac{3}{19}\) from \(\frac{718}{285}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 285 and 19 is 5415.

Convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{718}{285} = \frac{718 \times 19}{285 \times 19} = \frac{13642}{5415}
\]

\[
\frac{3}{19} = \frac{3 \times 285}{19 \times 285} = \frac{855}{5415}
\]

Now, subtract the second fraction from the first:

\[
\frac{13642}{5415} - \frac{855}{5415} = \frac{13642 - 855}{5415} = \frac{12787}{5415}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{12787}{5415}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12787 and 5415. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

\[
12787 \div 5415 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 2957)}
\]
\[
5415 \div 2957 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 2458)}
\]
\[
2957 \div 2458 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 499)}
\]
\[
2458 \div 499 \approx 4 \quad \text{(remainder 462)}
\]
\[
499 \div 462 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 37)}
\]
\[
462 \div 37 \approx 12 \quad \text{(remainder 18)}
\]
\[
37 \div 18 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}
\]
\[
18 \div 1 \approx 18 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 1, meaning \(\frac{12787}{5415}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{58}{15}\) and \(\frac{33}{95}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 95 is 285.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{58}{15} = \frac{58 \times 19}{15 \times 19} = \frac{1102}{285}
\]

\[
\frac{33}{95} = \frac{33 \times 3}{95 \times 3} = \frac{99}{285}
\]

Now, we subtract the second fraction from the first:

\[
\frac{1102}{285} - \frac{99}{285} = \frac{1102 - 99}{285} = \frac{1003}{285}

To simplify \(\frac{1003}{285}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1003 and 285. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

            What is the sum of ((78 / 45) + (89 / 36)) added to itself? Answer as a simple fraction.

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify each fraction individually.

1. Simplify \(\frac{78}{45}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 78 and 45 is 3.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
     \[
     \frac{78 \div 3}{45 \div 3} = \frac{26}{15}
     \]

2. Simplify \(\frac{89}{36}\):
   - The GCD of 89 and 36 is 1 (since 89 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 36 other than 1).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{89}{36}\) is already in its simplest form.

Next, we add the two simplified fractions:
\[
\frac{26}{15} + \frac{89}{36}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 36 is 180.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 180:
\[
\frac{26}{15} = \frac{26 \times 12}{15 \times 12} = \frac{312}{180}
\]
\[
\frac{89}{36} = \frac{89 \times 5}{36 \times 5} = \frac{445}{180}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{312}{180} + \frac{445}{180} = \frac{312 + 445}{180} = \frac{757}{180}
\]

Since we need to add this sum to itself:
\[
2 \times \frac{757}{180} = \frac{2 \times 757}{180} = \frac{1514}{180}
\]

Finally, simplify \(\frac{1514}{180}\):
- The GCD of 1514 and 180 is 2.
- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
  \[
  \frac{1514 \div 2}{180 \div 2} = \frac{757}{90}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the sum of \(\left(\frac{78}{45} + \frac{89}{36}\right)\) that we previously calculated:

\[
\frac{26}{15} + \frac{89}{36} = \frac{757}{180}
\]

We also found that adding this sum to itself results in:

\[
2 \times \frac{757}{180} = \frac{1514}{180} = \frac{757}{90}
\]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{757}{90}\) to the original sum \(\frac{757}{180}\).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 90 and 180 is 180.

Convert \(\frac{757}{90}\) to have the common denominator of 180:
\[
\frac{757}{90} = \frac{757 \times 2}{90 \times 2} = \frac{1514}{180}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1514}{180} + \frac{757}{180} = \frac{1514 + 757}{180} = \frac{2271}{180}
\]

Finally, simplify \(\frac{2271}{180}\):
- The GCD of 2271 and 180 is 3.
- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
  \[
  \frac{2271 \div 3}{180 \div 3} = \frac{757}{60}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify each fraction individually.

1. Simplify \(\frac{78}{93}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 78 and 93 is 3.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
     \[
     \frac{78 \div 3}{93 \div 3} = \frac{26}{31}
     \]

2. Simplify \(\frac{89}{36}\):
   - The GCD of 89 and 36 is 1 (since 89 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 36 other than 1).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{89}{36}\) is already in its simplest form.

Next, we add the two simplified fractions:
\[
\frac{26}{31} + \frac{89}{36}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 31 and 36 is 1116.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1116:
\[
\frac{26}{31} = \frac{26 \times 36}{31 \times 36} = \frac{936}{1116}
\]
\[
\frac{89}{36} = \frac{89 \times 31}{36 \times 31} = \frac{2759}{1116}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{936}{1116} + \frac{2759}{1116} = \frac{936 + 2759}{1116} = \frac{3695}{1116}
\]

Since we need to add this sum to itself:
\[
2 \times \frac{3695}{1116} = \frac{2 \times 3695}{1116} = \frac{7390}{1116}
\]

Finally, simplify \(\frac{7390}{1116}\):
- The GCD of 7390 and 1116 is 2.
- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
  \[
  \frac{7390 \div 2}{1116 \div 2} = \frac{3695}{558}

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to express 93 divided by 34 as a fraction:

\[ \frac{93}{34} \]

Next, we need to subtract the fraction \(\frac{77}{74}\) from \(\frac{93}{34}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 34 and 74 is 2 * 17 * 37 = 1258.

We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{93}{34} = \frac{93 \times 37}{34 \times 37} = \frac{3441}{1258} \]

\[ \frac{77}{74} = \frac{77 \times 17}{74 \times 17} = \frac{1309}{1258} \]

Now, we subtract the second fraction from the first:

\[ \frac{3441}{1258} - \frac{1309}{1258} = \frac{3441 - 1309}{1258} = \frac{2132}{1258} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{2132}{1258}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2132 and 1258, which is 2:

\[ \frac{2132 \div 2}{1258 \div 2} = \frac{1066}{629} \]

We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{1066}{629} = \frac{1066 \times 70}{629 \times 70} = \frac{74620}{44030} \]

\[ \frac{64}{70} = \frac{64 \times 629}{70 \times 629} = \frac{40256}{44030} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[ \frac{74620}{44030} + \frac{40256}{44030} = \frac{74620 + 40256}{44030} = \frac{114876}{44030} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{114876}{44030}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 114876 and 44030, which is 2:

Next, we need to subtract the fraction \(\frac{77}{51}\) from \(\frac{93}{34}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 34 and 51 is 34 * 51 / GCD(34, 51). The GCD of 34 and 51 is 17, so the LCM is:

\[ \frac{34 \times 51}{17} = 102 \]

We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{93}{34} = \frac{93 \times 3}{34 \times 3} = \frac{279}{102} \]

\[ \frac{77}{51} = \frac{77 \times 2}{51 \times 2} = \frac{154}{102} \]

Now, we subtract the second fraction from the first:

\[ \frac{279}{102} - \frac{154}{102} = \frac{279 - 154}{102} = \frac{125}{102} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{86}{35}\) and \(\frac{68}{85}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 35 and 85 will serve as the common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 35 and 85:
- \(35 = 5 \times 7\)
- \(85 = 5 \times 17\)

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present:
- LCM = \(5 \times 7 \times 17 = 595\)

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 595:
\[
\frac{86}{35} = \frac{86 \times 17}{35 \times 17} = \frac{1462}{595}
\]
\[
\frac{68}{85} = \frac{68 \times 7}{85 \times 7} = \frac{476}{595}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1462}{595} + \frac{476}{595} = \frac{1462 + 476}{595} = \frac{1938}{595}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{1938}{595}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1938 and 595. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
1938 \div 595 \approx 3 \quad \text{(remainder 153)}
\]
\[
595 \div 153 \approx 3 \quad \text{(remainder 136)}
\]
\[
153 \div 136 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 17)}
\]
\[
136 \div 17 = 8 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 17. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 17:
\[
\frac{1938 \div 17}{595 \div 17} = \frac{114}{35}
\]

Thus, the simplified sum of the fractions is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we start with the sum of \(\frac{86}{35}\) and \(\frac{68}{85}\) that we previously calculated and simplified to \(\frac{114}{35}\).

Now, we need to add \(\frac{114}{35}\) to \(\frac{86}{35}\):
\[
\frac{114}{35} + \frac{86}{35} = \frac{114 + 86}{35} = \frac{200}{35}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{200}{35}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 200 and 35. The prime factorizations are:
- \(200 = 2^3 \times 5^2\)
- \(35 = 5 \times 7\)

The common factor is 5. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
\[
\frac{200 \div 5}{35 \div 5} = \frac{40}{7}

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present:

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1275:
\[

\]
\[
\frac{68}{85} = \frac{68 \times 15}{85 \times 15} = \frac{1020}{1275}

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1462}{1275} + \frac{1020}{1275} = \frac{1462 + 1020}{1275} = \frac{2482}{1275}

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{99}{53}\) and \(\frac{67}{94}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 53 and 94 will serve as the common denominator.

First, let's determine the LCM of 53 and 94. Since 53 is a prime number, we check if it divides 94:
\[ 94 \div 53 \approx 1.77 \]
Since 53 does not divide 94 evenly, the LCM is simply \(53 \times 94\).

Calculating the product:
\[ 53 \times 94 = 4982 \]

Now, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 4982:
\[ \frac{99}{53} = \frac{99 \times 94}{53 \times 94} = \frac{9306}{4982} \]
\[ \frac{67}{94} = \frac{67 \times 53}{94 \times 53} = \frac{3551}{4982} \]

Next, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{9306}{4982} + \frac{3551}{4982} = \frac{9306 + 3551}{4982} = \frac{12857}{4982} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{12857}{4982}\). We check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12857 and 4982. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[ 12857 \div 4982 \approx 2.58 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 2893)} \]
\[ 4982 \div 2893 \approx 1.72 \quad \text{(quotient 1, remainder 2089)} \]
\[ 2893 \div 2089 \approx 1.38 \quad \text{(quotient 1, remainder 804)} \]
\[ 2089 \div 804 \approx 2.60 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 481)} \]
\[ 804 \div 481 \approx 1.67 \quad \text{(quotient 1, remainder 323)} \]
\[ 481 \div 323 \approx 1.49 \quad \text{(quotient 1, remainder 158)} \]
\[ 323 \div 158 \approx 2.04 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 7)} \]
\[ 158 \div 7 = 22.57 \quad \text{(quotient 22, remainder 4)} \]
\[ 7 \div 4 = 1.75 \quad \text{(quotient 1, remainder 3)} \]
\[ 4 \div 3 = 1.33 \quad \text{(quotient 1, remainder 1)} \]
\[ 3 \div 1 = 3 \quad \text{(quotient 3, remainder 0)} \]

The GCD is 1, so the fraction \(\frac{12857}{4982}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fraction \(\frac{50}{56}\) to the sum \(\frac{12857}{4982}\), we first need to simplify \(\frac{50}{56}\).

Simplifying \(\frac{50}{56}\):
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 50 and 56 is 2.
\[ \frac{50}{56} = \frac{50 \div 2}{56 \div 2} = \frac{25}{28} \]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{25}{28}\) to \(\frac{12857}{4982}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4982 and 28 will serve as the common denominator.

First, let's determine the LCM of 4982 and 28. We can use the prime factorization method:
- Prime factorization of 4982: \(4982 = 2 \times 2491 = 2 \times 47 \times 53\)
- Prime factorization of 28: \(28 = 2^2 \times 7\)

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
\[ \text{LCM}(4982, 28) = 2^2 \times 7 \times 47 \times 53 = 4 \times 7 \times 47 \times 53 \]

Calculating the product:
\[ 4 \times 7 = 28 \]
\[ 28 \times 47 = 1316 \]
\[ 1316 \times 53 = 69748 \]

So, the common denominator is 69748.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 69748:
\[ \frac{12857}{4982} = \frac{12857 \times 14}{4982 \times 14} = \frac{180398}{69748} \]
\[ \frac{25}{28} = \frac{25 \times 2491}{28 \times 2491} = \frac{62275}{69748} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{180398}{69748} + \frac{62275}{69748} = \frac{180398 + 62275}{69748} = \frac{242673}{69748} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{242673}{69748}\). We check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 242673 and 69748. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[ 242673 \div 69748 \approx 3.48 \quad \text{(quotient 3, remainder 33529)} \]
\[ 69748 \div 33529 \approx 2.08 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 2689)} \]
\[ 33529 \div 2689 \approx 12.47 \quad \text{(quotient 12, remainder 1161)} \]
\[ 2689 \div 1161 \approx 2.32 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 367)} \]
\[ 1161 \div 367 \approx 3.16 \quad \text{(quotient 3, remainder 60)} \]
\[ 367 \div 60 \approx 6.12 \quad \text{(quotient 6, remainder 7)} \]
\[ 60 \div 7 \approx 8.57 \quad \text{(quotient 8, remainder 4)} \]
\[ 7 \div 4 = 1.75 \quad \text{(quotient 1, remainder 3)} \]
\[ 4 \div 3 = 1.33 \quad \text{(quotient 1, remainder 1)} \]
\[ 3 \div 1 = 3 \quad \text{(quotient 3, remainder 0)} \]

The GCD is 1, so the fraction \(\frac{242673}{69748}\) is already in its simplest form.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

1. Convert \( \frac{74}{27} \):
\[ \frac{74}{27} = \frac{74 \times 11}{27 \times 11} = \frac{814}{297} \]

2. Convert \( \frac{56}{33} \):
\[ \frac{56}{33} = \frac{56 \times 9}{33 \times 9} = \frac{504}{297} \]

Now, we subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{814}{297} - \frac{504}{297} = \frac{814 - 504}{297} = \frac{310}{297} \]

To simplify \( \frac{310}{297} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 310 and 297. The GCD of 310 and 297 is 1, meaning the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we start with the result from the previous calculation:
\[ \frac{310}{297} \]

Next, we need to add \( \frac{92}{70} \) to this fraction. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 297 and 70 is 20790.

Convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

1. Convert \( \frac{310}{297} \):
\[ \frac{310}{297} = \frac{310 \times 70}{297 \times 70} = \frac{21700}{20790} \]

2. Convert \( \frac{92}{70} \):
\[ \frac{92}{70} = \frac{92 \times 297}{70 \times 297} = \frac{27324}{20790} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{21700}{20790} + \frac{27324}{20790} = \frac{21700 + 27324}{20790} = \frac{49024}{20790} \]

To simplify \( \frac{49024}{20790} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 49024 and 20790. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the GCD is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{49024 \div 2}{20790 \div 2} = \frac{24512}{10395} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the sum of \( \frac{96}{40} \) and \( \frac{11}{99} \).

1. Simplify \( \frac{96}{40} \):
   \[
   \frac{96}{40} = \frac{96 \div 8}{40 \div 8} = \frac{12}{5}
   \]

2. The fraction \( \frac{11}{99} \) can be simplified:
   \[
   \frac{11}{99} = \frac{11 \div 11}{99 \div 11} = \frac{1}{9}
   \]

Next, we need to find a common denominator to add \( \frac{12}{5} \) and \( \frac{1}{9} \). The least common multiple of 5 and 9 is 45.

3. Convert \( \frac{12}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 45:
   \[
   \frac{12}{5} = \frac{12 \times 9}{5 \times 9} = \frac{108}{45}
   \]

4. Convert \( \frac{1}{9} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 45:
   \[
   \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1 \times 5}{9 \times 5} = \frac{5}{45}
   \]

5. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{108}{45} + \frac{5}{45} = \frac{108 + 5}{45} = \frac{113}{45}
   \]

Now, we need to subtract \( \frac{91}{65} \) from \( \frac{113}{45} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 45 and 65 is 2925.

6. Convert \( \frac{113}{45} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 2925:
   \[
   \frac{113}{45} = \frac{113 \times 65}{45 \times 65} = \frac{7345}{2925}
   \]

7. Convert \( \frac{91}{65} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 2925:
   \[
   \frac{91}{65} = \frac{91 \times 45}{65 \times 45} = \frac{4095}{2925}
   \]

8. Subtract the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{7345}{2925} - \frac{4095}{2925} = \frac{7345 - 4095}{2925} = \frac{3250}{2925}
   \]

Finally, simplify \( \frac{3250}{2925} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3250 and 2925 is 25.

9. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{3250}{2925} = \frac{3250 \div 25}{2925 \div 25} = \frac{130}{117}
   \]

10. Check if \( \frac{130}{117} \) can be simplified further. The GCD of 130 and 117 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add \( \frac{130}{117} \) and \( \frac{86}{73} \), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 117 and 73 is 117 * 73, since 117 and 73 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1).

1. Calculate the common denominator:
   \[
   117 \times 73 = 8541
   \]

2. Convert \( \frac{130}{117} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 8541:
   \[
   \frac{130}{117} = \frac{130 \times 73}{117 \times 73} = \frac{9490}{8541}
   \]

3. Convert \( \frac{86}{73} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 8541:
   \[
   \frac{86}{73} = \frac{86 \times 117}{73 \times 117} = \frac{10062}{8541}
   \]

4. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{9490}{8541} + \frac{10062}{8541} = \frac{9490 + 10062}{8541} = \frac{19552}{8541}
   \]

Next, we need to simplify \( \frac{19552}{8541} \). We check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 19552 and 8541. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

- \( 19552 \div 8541 \approx 2 \) with a remainder of \( 2470 \)
- \( 8541 \div 2470 \approx 3 \) with a remainder of \( 1131 \)
- \( 2470 \div 1131 \approx 2 \) with a remainder of \( 208 \)
- \( 1131 \div 208 \approx 5 \) with a remainder of \( 131 \)
- \( 208 \div 131 \approx 1 \) with a remainder of \( 77 \)
- \( 131 \div 77 \approx 1 \) with a remainder of \( 54 \)
- \( 77 \div 54 \approx 1 \) with a remainder of \( 23 \)
- \( 54 \div 23 \approx 2 \) with a remainder of \( 8 \)
- \( 23 \div 8 \approx 2 \) with a remainder of \( 7 \)
- \( 8 \div 7 \approx 1 \) with a remainder of \( 1 \)
- \( 7 \div 1 = 7 \) with a remainder of \( 0 \)

The GCD is 1, so \( \frac{19552}{8541} \) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's correct the problem by adding \( \frac{96}{40} \) and \( \frac{11}{99} \) correctly, and then subtracting \( \frac{91}{65} \).

First, simplify \( \frac{96}{40} \):
\[
\frac{96}{40} = \frac{96 \div 8}{40 \div 8} = \frac{12}{5}
\]

Next, simplify \( \frac{11}{99} \):
\[
\frac{11}{99} = \frac{11 \div 11}{99 \div 11} = \frac{1}{9}
\]

Now, find a common denominator to add \( \frac{12}{5} \) and \( \frac{1}{9} \). The least common multiple of 5 and 9 is 45.

Convert \( \frac{12}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 45:
\[
\frac{12}{5} = \frac{12 \times 9}{5 \times 9} = \frac{108}{45}
\]

Convert \( \frac{1}{9} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 45:
\[
\frac{1}{9} = \frac{1 \times 5}{9 \times 5} = \frac{5}{45}
\]

Add the fractions:
\[
\frac{108}{45} + \frac{5}{45} = \frac{108 + 5}{45} = \frac{113}{45}
\]

Now, subtract \( \frac{91}{65} \) from \( \frac{113}{45} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 45 and 65 is 2925.

Convert \( \frac{113}{45} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 2925:
\[
\frac{113}{45} = \frac{113 \times 65}{45 \times 65} = \frac{7345}{2925}
\]

Convert \( \frac{91}{65} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 2925:
\[
\frac{91}{65} = \frac{91 \times 45}{65 \times 45} = \frac{4095}{2925}
\]

Subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{7345}{2925} - \frac{4095}{2925} = \frac{7345 - 4095}{2925} = \frac{3250}{2925}
\]

Simplify \( \frac{3250}{2925} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3250 and 2925 is 25.

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{3250}{2925} = \frac{3250 \div 25}{2925 \div 25} = \frac{130}{117}
\]

Check if \( \frac{130}{117} \) can be simplified further. The GCD of 130 and 117 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to divide 10 by 5:
\[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]

2. Next, we need to divide 35 by 27:
\[ \frac{35}{27} \]

3. We add these two results to get \( h \):
\[ h = 2 + \frac{35}{27} \]

4. Now, we need to add 47 divided by 99 to \( h \):
\[ \frac{47}{99} \]

5. So, the value \( p \) is:
\[ p = 2 + \frac{35}{27} + \frac{47}{99} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 27 and 99 is 297.

First, convert \(\frac{35}{27}\) to have a denominator of 297:
\[ \frac{35}{27} = \frac{35 \times 11}{27 \times 11} = \frac{385}{297} \]

Next, convert \(\frac{47}{99}\) to have a denominator of 297:
\[ \frac{47}{99} = \frac{47 \times 3}{99 \times 3} = \frac{141}{297} \]

Now, add these fractions:
\[ \frac{385}{297} + \frac{141}{297} = \frac{385 + 141}{297} = \frac{526}{297} \]

Now, add this result to 2:
\[ p = 2 + \frac{526}{297} \]

Convert 2 to a fraction with a denominator of 297:
\[ 2 = \frac{2 \times 297}{297} = \frac{594}{297} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ p = \frac{594}{297} + \frac{526}{297} = \frac{594 + 526}{297} = \frac{1120}{297} \]

First, simplify \( \frac{68}{98} \):
\[ \frac{68}{98} = \frac{34 \times 2}{49 \times 2} = \frac{34}{49} \]

Next, we add this result to the previously obtained value \( p = \frac{1120}{297} \).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 297 and 49 is 14553.

First, convert \( \frac{1120}{297} \) to have a denominator of 14553:
\[ \frac{1120}{297} = \frac{1120 \times 49}{297 \times 49} = \frac{54880}{14553} \]

Next, convert \( \frac{34}{49} \) to have a denominator of 14553:

Now, add these fractions:
\[ \frac{54880}{14553} + \frac{10098}{14553} = \frac{54880 + 10098}{14553} = \frac{64978}{14553} \]

\[ \frac{35}{27} \]

3. We add these two results to get \( h \):
\[ h = 2 + \frac{35}{27} \]

4. Now, we need to add 50 divided by 99 to \( h \):

5. So, the new value \( p \) is:
\[ p = 2 + \frac{35}{27} + \frac{50}{99} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 27 and 99 is 297.

First, convert \(\frac{35}{27}\) to have a denominator of 297:
\[ \frac{35}{27} = \frac{35 \times 11}{27 \times 11} = \frac{385}{297} \]

Next, convert \(\frac{50}{99}\) to have a denominator of 297:
\[ \frac{50}{99} = \frac{50 \times 3}{99 \times 3} = \frac{150}{297} \]

Now, add these fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{90}{81} \). Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 9:

\[
\frac{90 \div 9}{81 \div 9} = \frac{10}{9}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{2}{66} \). Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

\[
\frac{2 \div 2}{66 \div 2} = \frac{1}{33}
\]

Now, we need to add \( \frac{10}{9} \) and \( \frac{1}{33} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 33 is 99. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{10}{9} = \frac{10 \times 11}{9 \times 11} = \frac{110}{99}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{33} = \frac{1 \times 3}{33 \times 3} = \frac{3}{99}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{110}{99} + \frac{3}{99} = \frac{110 + 3}{99} = \frac{113}{99}
\]

The fraction \( \frac{113}{99} \) is already in its simplest form because 113 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 99 other than 1.

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{7006}{6138} + \frac{7623}{6138} = \frac{7006 + 7623}{6138} = \frac{14629}{6138}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{14629}{6138} \), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14629 and 6138. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 14629 \div 6138 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 4353.
2. \( 6138 \div 4353 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1785.
3. \( 4353 \div 1785 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 783.
4. \( 1785 \div 783 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 219.
5. \( 783 \div 219 \) gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 126.
6. \( 219 \div 126 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 93.
7. \( 126 \div 93 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 33.
8. \( 93 \div 33 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 27.
9. \( 33 \div 27 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 6.
10. \( 27 \div 6 \) gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 3.
11. \( 6 \div 3 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0.

The GCD is 3. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{14629 \div 3}{6138 \div 3} = \frac{4876.33}{2046}
\]

Since 4876.33 is not an integer, it indicates a mistake in the Euclidean algorithm steps. Let's correct it:

1. \( 14629 \div 6138 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 4353.
2. \( 6138 \div 4353 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1785.
3. \( 4353 \div 1785 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 783.
4. \( 1785 \div 783 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 219.
5. \( 783 \div 219 \) gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 126.
6. \( 219 \div 126 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 93.
7. \( 126 \div 93 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 33.
8. \( 93 \div 33 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 27.
9. \( 33 \div 27 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 6.
10. \( 27 \div 6 \) gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 3.
11. \( 6 \div 3 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0.

The GCD is indeed 3. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{14629 \div 3}{6138 \div 3} = \frac{4876.33}{2046}
\]

            Previously, you calculated the sum of the fraction 90/81 and 2/66. In a new scenario, what if you started with 90/39 instead of 90/81 then added it with 2/66? What would be the result in the simplest form?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{90}{39} \). Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

\[
\frac{90 \div 3}{39 \div 3} = \frac{30}{13}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{2}{66} \). Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

\[
\frac{2 \div 2}{66 \div 2} = \frac{1}{33}
\]

Now, we need to add \( \frac{30}{13} \) and \( \frac{1}{33} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 33 is 429. We convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{30}{13} = \frac{30 \times 33}{13 \times 33} = \frac{990}{429}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{33} = \frac{1 \times 13}{33 \times 13} = \frac{13}{429}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{990}{429} + \frac{13}{429} = \frac{990 + 13}{429} = \frac{1003}{429}
\]

The fraction \( \frac{1003}{429} \) is already in its simplest form because 1003 and 429 do not share any common factors other than 1.

Each piece of ribbon is \( \frac{56}{41} \) yards long.

Since the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators directly:

Each piece of ribbon is \( \frac{56}{41} \) yards long, so the total length is:

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of \( \frac{92}{75} + \frac{66}{92} \), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 75 and 92 will be our common denominator.

1. **Find the LCM of 75 and 92:**
   - The prime factorization of 75 is \( 3 \times 5^2 \).
   - The prime factorization of 92 is \( 2^2 \times 23 \).

   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
   - \( 2^2 \) (from 92)
   - \( 3 \) (from 75)
   - \( 5^2 \) (from 75)
   - \( 23 \) (from 92)

   Therefore, the LCM is \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \times 23 = 4 \times 3 \times 25 \times 23 = 6900 \).

2. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 6900:**
   - For \( \frac{92}{75} \):
     \[
     \frac{92}{75} = \frac{92 \times 92}{75 \times 92} = \frac{8464}{6900}
     \]

   - For \( \frac{66}{92} \):
     \[
     \frac{66}{92} = \frac{66 \times 75}{92 \times 75} = \frac{4950}{6900}
     \]

3. **Add the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{8464}{6900} + \frac{4950}{6900} = \frac{8464 + 4950}{6900} = \frac{13414}{6900}
   \]

4. **Simplify the fraction:**
   - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 13414 and 6900. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
     \[
     \text{GCD}(13414, 6900) = 2
     \]

   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
     \[
     \frac{13414 \div 2}{6900 \div 2} = \frac{6707}{3450}

1. **Express \( \frac{97}{17} \) with the same denominator as \( \frac{6707}{3450} \):**
   - The least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 3450 is 3450 because 3450 is already a multiple of 17.
   - Convert \( \frac{97}{17} \) to have the denominator 3450:
     \[
     \frac{97}{17} = \frac{97 \times 203}{17 \times 203} = \frac{19711}{3450}
     \]

2. **Subtract \( \frac{6707}{3450} \) from \( \frac{19711}{3450} \):**
   \[
   \frac{19711}{3450} - \frac{6707}{3450} = \frac{19711 - 6707}{3450} = \frac{13004}{3450}
   \]

3. **Simplify the fraction \( \frac{13004}{3450} \):**
   - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 13004 and 3450. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
     \[
     \text{GCD}(13004, 3450) = 2

   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
     \[
     \frac{13004 \div 2}{3450 \div 2} = \frac{6502}{1725}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{32}{65}\) and \(\frac{73}{22}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 65 and 22 will be our common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 65 and 22:
- 65 = 5 Ã— 13
- 22 = 2 Ã— 11

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
- LCM = 2 Ã— 5 Ã— 11 Ã— 13 = 1430

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1430:
- \(\frac{32}{65}\) needs to be multiplied by \(\frac{22}{22}\):
  \[
  \frac{32}{65} \times \frac{22}{22} = \frac{32 \times 22}{65 \times 22} = \frac{704}{1430}
  \]

- \(\frac{73}{22}\) needs to be multiplied by \(\frac{65}{65}\):
  \[
  \frac{73}{22} \times \frac{65}{65} = \frac{73 \times 65}{22 \times 65} = \frac{4745}{1430}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{704}{1430} + \frac{4745}{1430} = \frac{704 + 4745}{1430} = \frac{5449}{1430}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \(\frac{5449}{1430}\) and \(\frac{24}{71}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1430 and 71 will be our common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 1430 and 71:
- 1430 = 2 Ã— 5 Ã— 11 Ã— 13
- 71 is a prime number

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
- LCM = 2 Ã— 5 Ã— 11 Ã— 13 Ã— 71 = 101530

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 101530:
- \(\frac{5449}{1430}\) needs to be multiplied by \(\frac{71}{71}\):
  \[
  \frac{5449}{1430} \times \frac{71}{71} = \frac{5449 \times 71}{1430 \times 71} = \frac{386879}{101530}
  \]

- \(\frac{24}{71}\) needs to be multiplied by \(\frac{1430}{1430}\):
  \[
  \frac{24}{71} \times \frac{1430}{1430} = \frac{24 \times 1430}{71 \times 1430} = \frac{34320}{101530}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{386879}{101530} + \frac{34320}{101530} = \frac{386879 + 34320}{101530} = \frac{421199}{101530}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{53}{65}\) and \(\frac{73}{22}\), we again need to find a common denominator. As before, the least common multiple (LCM) of 65 and 22 is 1430.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1430:
- \(\frac{53}{65}\) needs to be multiplied by \(\frac{22}{22}\):
  \[
  \frac{53}{65} \times \frac{22}{22} = \frac{53 \times 22}{65 \times 22} = \frac{1166}{1430}
  \]

- \(\frac{73}{22}\) needs to be multiplied by \(\frac{65}{65}\):
  \[
  \frac{73}{22} \times \frac{65}{65} = \frac{73 \times 65}{22 \times 65} = \frac{4745}{1430}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1166}{1430} + \frac{4745}{1430} = \frac{1166 + 4745}{1430} = \frac{5911}{1430}

            What is the difference between 51/34 and 12/86? Express your answer in its simplest form.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the difference between the fractions \( \frac{51}{34} \) and \( \frac{12}{86} \), we first need to express them with a common denominator.

1. **Simplify the fractions if possible:**
   - \( \frac{51}{34} \) is already in its simplest form.
   - \( \frac{12}{86} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
     \[
     \frac{12 \div 2}{86 \div 2} = \frac{6}{43}
     \]

2. **Find a common denominator:**
   - The denominators are 34 and 43. The least common multiple (LCM) of 34 and 43 is 34 * 43 = 1462 (since 34 and 43 are coprime).

3. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator:**
   - For \( \frac{51}{34} \):
     \[
     \frac{51}{34} = \frac{51 \times 43}{34 \times 43} = \frac{2193}{1462}
     \]
   - For \( \frac{6}{43} \):
     \[
     \frac{6}{43} = \frac{6 \times 34}{43 \times 34} = \frac{204}{1462}
     \]

4. **Subtract the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{2193}{1462} - \frac{204}{1462} = \frac{2193 - 204}{1462} = \frac{1989}{1462}
   \]

5. **Simplify the resulting fraction:**
   - To simplify \( \frac{1989}{1462} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1989 and 1462. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
     \[
     1989 \div 1462 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 527)}
     \]
     \[
     1462 \div 527 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 408)}
     \]
     \[
     527 \div 408 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 119)}
     \]
     \[
     408 \div 119 \approx 3 \quad \text{(remainder 51)}
     \]
     \[
     119 \div 51 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 17)}
     \]
     \[
     51 \div 17 \approx 3 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
     \]
     The GCD is 17.

   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 17:
     \[
     \frac{1989 \div 17}{1462 \div 17} = \frac{117}{86}
     \]

6. **Simplify further if possible:**
   - The fraction \( \frac{117}{86} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 1 (since 117 and 86 are coprime).

Thus, the simplest form of the difference is \( \frac{117}{86} \).

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the difference between \( \frac{51}{34} \) and \( \frac{12}{86} \):**

   As previously calculated, the difference is:
   \[
   \frac{51}{34} - \frac{12}{86} = \frac{117}{86}
   \]

2. **Subtract \( \frac{30}{91} \) from \( \frac{117}{86} \):**

   To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 86 and 91. The least common multiple (LCM) of 86 and 91 is 86 * 91 = 7826 (since 86 and 91 are coprime).

3. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator:**
   - For \( \frac{117}{86} \):
     \[
     \frac{117}{86} = \frac{117 \times 91}{86 \times 91} = \frac{10647}{7826}
     \]
   - For \( \frac{30}{91} \):
     \[
     \frac{30}{91} = \frac{30 \times 86}{91 \times 86} = \frac{2580}{7826}
     \]

4. **Subtract the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{10647}{7826} - \frac{2580}{7826} = \frac{10647 - 2580}{7826} = \frac{8067}{7826}
   \]

5. **Simplify the resulting fraction:**
   - To simplify \( \frac{8067}{7826} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8067 and 7826. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
     \[
     8067 \div 7826 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 241)}
     \]
     \[
     7826 \div 241 \approx 32 \quad \text{(remainder 94)}
     \]
     \[
     241 \div 94 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 53)}
     \]
     \[
     94 \div 53 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 41)}
     \]
     \[
     53 \div 41 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 12)}
     \]
     \[
     41 \div 12 \approx 3 \quad \text{(remainder 5)}
     \]
     \[
     12 \div 5 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 2)}
     \]
     \[
     5 \div 2 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}
     \]
     \[
     2 \div 1 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
     \]
     The GCD is 1.

   - Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \( \frac{8067}{7826} \) is already in its simplest form.

     \[

     \[
     425 \div 187 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 51)}

     \[

     \[

     The GCD is 17.

   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 17:
     \[
     \frac{1887 \div 17}{1462 \div 17} = \frac{111}{86}

Thus, the simplest form of the difference is \( \frac{111}{86} \).

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's add the whole number 51 to the fraction \( \frac{93}{8} \).

Convert 51 to a fraction with the same denominator as \( \frac{93}{8} \):
\[ 51 = \frac{51 \times 8}{8} = \frac{408}{8} \]

Now add \( \frac{408}{8} \) and \( \frac{93}{8} \):
\[ \frac{408}{8} + \frac{93}{8} = \frac{408 + 93}{8} = \frac{501}{8} \]

Next, we need to add \( \frac{501}{8} \) to \( \frac{58}{44} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 44 is 88.

Convert \( \frac{501}{8} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 88:
\[ \frac{501}{8} = \frac{501 \times 11}{8 \times 11} = \frac{5511}{88} \]

Convert \( \frac{58}{44} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 88:
\[ \frac{58}{44} = \frac{58 \times 2}{44 \times 2} = \frac{116}{88} \]

Now add \( \frac{5511}{88} \) and \( \frac{116}{88} \):
\[ \frac{5511}{88} + \frac{116}{88} = \frac{5511 + 116}{88} = \frac{5627}{88} \]

Finally, we need to simplify \( \frac{5627}{88} \). Since 5627 and 88 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add \( \frac{38}{53} \) to our previous result \( \frac{5627}{88} \), we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 88 and 53 is 88 * 53, since 88 and 53 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1).

First, calculate the LCM:
\[ 88 \times 53 = 4664 \]

Convert \( \frac{5627}{88} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4664:
\[ \frac{5627}{88} = \frac{5627 \times 53}{88 \times 53} = \frac{298231}{4664} \]

Convert \( \frac{38}{53} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4664:
\[ \frac{38}{53} = \frac{38 \times 88}{53 \times 88} = \frac{3344}{4664} \]

Now add \( \frac{298231}{4664} \) and \( \frac{3344}{4664} \):
\[ \frac{298231}{4664} + \frac{3344}{4664} = \frac{298231 + 3344}{4664} = \frac{301575}{4664} \]

Finally, we need to simplify \( \frac{301575}{4664} \). We check for common factors, but since 301575 and 4664 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the fraction subtraction \( \frac{82}{5} - \frac{98}{25} \), we first need to have a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 25 is 25.

First, we convert \( \frac{82}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 25:
\[ \frac{82}{5} = \frac{82 \times 5}{5 \times 5} = \frac{410}{25} \]

Now, we can perform the subtraction:
\[ \frac{410}{25} - \frac{98}{25} = \frac{410 - 98}{25} = \frac{312}{25} \]

Next, we check if the fraction \( \frac{312}{25} \) can be simplified. Since 312 and 25 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many oranges you would have left, we need to subtract \( \frac{98}{90} \) from \( \frac{82}{5} \).

First, let's convert \( \frac{82}{5} \) to a fraction with a common denominator with \( \frac{98}{90} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 90 is 90.

Convert \( \frac{82}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 90:
\[ \frac{82}{5} = \frac{82 \times 18}{5 \times 18} = \frac{1476}{90} \]

Now, we can perform the subtraction:
\[ \frac{1476}{90} - \frac{98}{90} = \frac{1476 - 98}{90} = \frac{1378}{90} \]

Next, we simplify \( \frac{1378}{90} \). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1378 and 90. 

The prime factorization of 1378 is:
\[ 1378 = 2 \times 689 \]

The prime factorization of 90 is:
\[ 90 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \]

The common factor is 2. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[ \frac{1378 \div 2}{90 \div 2} = \frac{689}{45} \]

Since 689 and 45 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is in its simplest form.

Next, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 50 and 22 is 1100. We will convert each fraction to have this common denominator.

For \(\frac{64}{50}\):

First, we need to calculate \( s \).

1. Calculate \( \frac{24}{6} \):

2. Calculate \( \frac{40}{53} \):

3. Add the two results to find \( s \):
   \[
   s = 4 + \frac{40}{53} \approx 4 + 0.7547 = 4.7547

Next, we need to find \( b \) by adding \( s \) to itself:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we simplify each fraction individually.

1. Simplify \( \frac{80}{90} \):
\[ \frac{80}{90} = \frac{8}{9} \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{52}{11} \):
\[ \frac{52}{11} \]

Next, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{8}{9} + \frac{52}{11} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 11 is 99.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 99:
\[ \frac{8}{9} = \frac{8 \times 11}{9 \times 11} = \frac{88}{99} \]
\[ \frac{52}{11} = \frac{52 \times 9}{11 \times 9} = \frac{468}{99} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{88}{99} + \frac{468}{99} = \frac{88 + 468}{99} = \frac{556}{99} \]

Next, we simplify \( \frac{556}{99} \):
\[ \frac{556}{99} \]

To express this as a mixed number, we perform the division:
\[ 556 \div 99 \approx 5 \text{ remainder } 61 \]

So, \( \frac{556}{99} \) can be written as:

Next, we need to add this to \( \frac{100}{13} \).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 99 and 13 is 1287.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1287:
\[ \frac{556}{99} = \frac{556 \times 13}{99 \times 13} = \frac{7228}{1287} \]
\[ \frac{100}{13} = \frac{100 \times 99}{13 \times 99} = \frac{9900}{1287} \]

Now, add the fractions:

Next, we simplify \( \frac{17128}{1287} \):
\[ \frac{17128}{1287} \]

To express this as a mixed number, we perform the division:
\[ 17128 \div 1287 \approx 13 \text{ remainder } 397 \]

So, \( \frac{17128}{1287} \) can be written as:

1. Simplify \( \frac{12}{18} \):
   \[
   \frac{12}{18} = \frac{12 \div 6}{18 \div 6} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

2. Now, we need to find a common denominator for \( \frac{2}{3} \) and \( \frac{91}{74} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 74 is 222.

3. Convert \( \frac{2}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 222:

2. Simplify \( \frac{842}{222} \):
   - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 842 and 222.

   \frac{962}{222} + \frac{273}{222} = \frac{962 + 273}{222} = \frac{1235}{222}

6. Simplify \( \frac{1235}{222} \) if possible. We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1235 and 222. The GCD is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{7}{2} \) and \( \frac{51}{25} \), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 25 is 50.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 50:

\[
\frac{7}{2} = \frac{7 \times 25}{2 \times 25} = \frac{175}{50}
\]

\[
\frac{51}{25} = \frac{51 \times 2}{25 \times 2} = \frac{102}{50}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{175}{50} + \frac{102}{50} = \frac{175 + 102}{50} = \frac{277}{50}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{277}{50}\) is already in its simplest form because 277 and 50 have no common factors other than 1.

Now, we need to add \( \frac{86}{39} \) to \( \frac{277}{50} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 50 and 39 is 1950.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1950:

\[
\frac{277}{50} = \frac{277 \times 39}{50 \times 39} = \frac{10803}{1950}

\[
\frac{86}{39} = \frac{86 \times 50}{39 \times 50} = \frac{4300}{1950}

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[

Now, we add the two fractions:

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify each part of the expression step by step.

1. Simplify \(\frac{68}{69}\):
   \[
   \frac{68}{69} \text{ (This fraction is already in its simplest form)}
   \]

2. Simplify \(\frac{93}{7}\):
   \[
   \frac{93}{7} \text{ (This fraction is also in its simplest form)}
   \]

Next, add these two fractions:
\[
\frac{68}{69} + \frac{93}{7}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 69 and 7 is \(69 \times 7 = 483\).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 483:
\[
\frac{68}{69} = \frac{68 \times 7}{69 \times 7} = \frac{476}{483}
\]
\[
\frac{93}{7} = \frac{93 \times 69}{7 \times 69} = \frac{6417}{483}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{476}{483} + \frac{6417}{483} = \frac{476 + 6417}{483} = \frac{6893}{483}
\]

Next, add \(\frac{3}{46}\) to the result:
\[
\frac{6893}{483} + \frac{3}{46}
\]

Again, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 483 and 46 is 22134.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 22134:
\[
\frac{6893}{483} = \frac{6893 \times 46}{483 \times 46} = \frac{316058}{22134}
\]
\[
\frac{3}{46} = \frac{3 \times 483}{46 \times 483} = \frac{1449}{22134}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{316058}{22134} + \frac{1449}{22134} = \frac{316058 + 1449}{22134} = \frac{317507}{22134}
\]

The resulting fraction \(\frac{317507}{22134}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify the fraction \( \frac{60}{4} \).

\[
\frac{60}{4} = 15
\]

Next, we need to add \( \frac{31}{98} \) to 15. To do this, we convert 15 to a fraction with a denominator of 98.

\[
15 = \frac{15 \times 98}{98} = \frac{1470}{98}
\]

Now, we add \( \frac{31}{98} \) to \( \frac{1470}{98} \):

\[
\frac{1470}{98} + \frac{31}{98} = \frac{1470 + 31}{98} = \frac{1501}{98}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the sum of \( \frac{31}{98} \) and \( \frac{60}{4} \) from the previous problem:

\[
\frac{31}{98} + 15 = \frac{31}{98} + \frac{1470}{98} = \frac{1501}{98}
\]

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{41}{52} \) from \( \frac{1501}{98} \). To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 98 and 52 is 2548.

Convert both fractions to have the denominator 2548:

\[
\frac{1501}{98} = \frac{1501 \times 26}{98 \times 26} = \frac{39026}{2548}
\]

\[
\frac{41}{52} = \frac{41 \times 49}{52 \times 49} = \frac{2009}{2548}
\]

Now, subtract \( \frac{2009}{2548} \) from \( \frac{39026}{2548} \):

\[
\frac{39026}{2548} - \frac{2009}{2548} = \frac{39026 - 2009}{2548} = \frac{37017}{2548}
\]

Finally, we simplify \( \frac{37017}{2548} \). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 37017 and 2548. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the GCD is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we need to add \( \frac{31}{98} \) to \( \frac{83}{4} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 98 is 196.

Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 196:

\[

\[
\frac{31}{98} = \frac{31 \times 2}{98 \times 2} = \frac{62}{196}

Now, add the two fractions:

            Firstly, calculate the sum of 92/54 and 90/13, then from the result take away 46/41. What's the result as a simplified fraction?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate the sum of \( \frac{92}{54} \) and \( \frac{90}{13} \).
2. Subtract \( \frac{46}{41} \) from the result obtained in step 1.
3. Simplify the final result.

Let's start with step 1:

First, we need a common denominator to add \( \frac{92}{54} \) and \( \frac{90}{13} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 54 and 13 is 702.

Convert \( \frac{92}{54} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 702:
\[ \frac{92}{54} = \frac{92 \times 13}{54 \times 13} = \frac{1196}{702} \]

Convert \( \frac{90}{13} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 702:
\[ \frac{90}{13} = \frac{90 \times 54}{13 \times 54} = \frac{4860}{702} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{1196}{702} + \frac{4860}{702} = \frac{1196 + 4860}{702} = \frac{6056}{702} \]

Next, simplify \( \frac{6056}{702} \):
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6056 and 702 is 2.
\[ \frac{6056 \div 2}{702 \div 2} = \frac{3028}{351} \]

Now, we move to step 2:

Subtract \( \frac{46}{41} \) from \( \frac{3028}{351} \). We need a common denominator for these fractions. The LCM of 351 and 41 is 14421.

Convert \( \frac{3028}{351} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 14421:
\[ \frac{3028}{351} = \frac{3028 \times 41}{351 \times 41} = \frac{124148}{14421} \]

Convert \( \frac{46}{41} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 14421:
\[ \frac{46}{41} = \frac{46 \times 351}{41 \times 351} = \frac{16146}{14421} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{124148}{14421} - \frac{16146}{14421} = \frac{124148 - 16146}{14421} = \frac{108002}{14421} \]

Finally, simplify \( \frac{108002}{14421} \):
The GCD of 108002 and 14421 is 1 (since they are relatively prime).

Thus, the fraction is already in its simplest form:
\[ \frac{108002}{14421} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{58}{23} \). We check if the numerator and the denominator have any common factors. Since 23 is a prime number and does not divide 58 evenly, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Convert both fractions to have the common denominator of 115:

\[
\frac{58}{23} = \frac{58 \times 5}{23 \times 5} = \frac{290}{115}
\]

\[
\frac{32}{5} = \frac{32 \times 23}{5 \times 23} = \frac{736}{115}

Now, subtract the two fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{29}{20}\) and \(\frac{17}{72}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 72 will be our common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 20 and 72:
- \(20 = 2^2 \times 5\)
- \(72 = 2^3 \times 3^2\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- \(2^3\) (from 72)
- \(3^2\) (from 72)
- \(5\) (from 20)

Thus, the LCM of 20 and 72 is \(2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5 = 8 \times 9 \times 5 = 360\).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 360:
- \(\frac{29}{20} = \frac{29 \times 18}{20 \times 18} = \frac{522}{360}\)
- \(\frac{17}{72} = \frac{17 \times 5}{72 \times 5} = \frac{85}{360}\)

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{522}{360} + \frac{85}{360} = \frac{522 + 85}{360} = \frac{607}{360}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{607}{360}\) is already in its simplest form because 607 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 360.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we start with the sum of \(\frac{29}{20}\) and \(\frac{17}{72}\) which we previously found to be \(\frac{607}{360}\).

Next, we need to subtract \(\frac{9}{68}\) from \(\frac{607}{360}\). To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{607}{360}\) and \(\frac{9}{68}\).

First, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of 360 and 68. We start with their prime factorizations:
- \(360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5\)
- \(68 = 2^2 \times 17\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- \(2^3\) (from 360)
- \(3^2\) (from 360)
- \(5\) (from 360)
- \(17\) (from 68)

Thus, the LCM of 360 and 68 is \(2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 17 = 8 \times 9 \times 5 \times 17 = 6120\).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 6120:
- \(\frac{607}{360} = \frac{607 \times 17}{360 \times 17} = \frac{10319}{6120}\)
- \(\frac{9}{68} = \frac{9 \times 90}{68 \times 90} = \frac{810}{6120}\)

Now, we subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{10319}{6120} - \frac{810}{6120} = \frac{10319 - 810}{6120} = \frac{9509}{6120}
\]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{9509}{6120}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9509 and 6120. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
- \(9509 \div 6120 \approx 1\) remainder \(3389\)
- \(6120 \div 3389 \approx 1\) remainder \(2731\)
- \(3389 \div 2731 \approx 1\) remainder \(658\)
- \(2731 \div 658 \approx 4\) remainder \(99\)
- \(658 \div 99 \approx 6\) remainder \(64\)
- \(99 \div 64 \approx 1\) remainder \(35\)
- \(64 \div 35 \approx 1\) remainder \(29\)
- \(35 \div 29 \approx 1\) remainder \(6\)
- \(29 \div 6 \approx 4\) remainder \(5\)
- \(6 \div 5 \approx 1\) remainder \(1\)
- \(5 \div 1 = 5\) remainder \(0\)

The GCD is 1, so the fraction \(\frac{9509}{6120}\) is already in its simplest form.

2. Calculate \( \frac{80}{10} \):
\[ \frac{80}{10} = 8 \]

3. Add the results from steps 1 and 2:
\[ \frac{4}{3} + 8 \]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 3 and 1 is 3:
\[ 8 = \frac{8 \times 3}{1 \times 3} = \frac{24}{3} \]

First, convert each fraction to have the common denominator 20856:

1. Convert \(\frac{1993}{237}\):
\[ \frac{1993}{237} = \frac{1993 \times 88}{237 \times 88} = \frac{175784}{20856} \]

Now, add the two fractions:

2. \( 179813 - 8 \times 20856 = 179813 - 166848 = 12965 \)
3. \( 20856 \div 12965 \approx 1.61 \) (integer part is 1)
4. \( 20856 - 1 \times 12965 = 20856 - 12965 = 7891 \)
5. \( 12965 \div 7891 \approx 1.64 \) (integer part is 1)
6. \( 12965 - 1 \times 7891 = 12965 - 7891 = 5074 \)
7. \( 7891 \div 5074 \approx 1.55 \) (integer part is 1)
8. \( 7891 - 1 \times 5074 = 7891 - 5074 = 2817 \)
9. \( 5074 \div 2817 \approx 1.80 \) (integer part is 1)
10. \( 5074 - 1 \times 2817 = 5074 - 2817 = 2257 \)
11. \( 2817 \div 2257 \approx 1.25 \) (integer part is 1)
12. \( 2817 - 1 \times 2257 = 2817 - 2257 = 560 \)
13. \( 2257 \div 560 \approx 4.03 \) (integer part is 4)
14. \( 2257 - 4 \times 560 = 2257 - 2240 = 17 \)
15. \( 560 \div 17 \approx 32.94 \) (integer part is 32)
16. \( 560 - 32 \times 17 = 560 - 544 = 16 \)
17. \( 17 \div 16 \approx 1.06 \) (integer part is 1)
18. \( 17 - 1 \times 16 = 17 - 16 = 1 \)

The GCD is 1, so the fraction \(\frac{179813}{20856}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{21}{75} + \frac{74}{43}\right) + \frac{10}{62}\), we need to add the fractions step by step.

First, let's simplify each fraction if possible:
- \(\frac{21}{75}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:
  \[
  \frac{21 \div 3}{75 \div 3} = \frac{7}{25}
  \]

- \(\frac{74}{43}\) is already in its simplest form because 74 and 43 have no common divisors other than 1.

- \(\frac{10}{62}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 2:
  \[
  \frac{10 \div 2}{62 \div 2} = \frac{5}{31}
  \]

Now, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 25, 43, and 31 is 33275.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 33275:
- \(\frac{7}{25}\):
  \[
  \frac{7 \times 1331}{25 \times 1331} = \frac{9317}{33275}
  \]

- \(\frac{74}{43}\):
  \[
  \frac{74 \times 775}{43 \times 775} = \frac{57350}{33275}
  \]

- \(\frac{5}{31}\):
  \[
  \frac{5 \times 1075}{31 \times 1075} = \frac{5375}{33275}
  \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{9317}{33275} + \frac{57350}{33275} + \frac{5375}{33275} = \frac{9317 + 57350 + 5375}{33275} = \frac{72042}{33275}
\]

Finally, simplify the fraction \(\frac{72042}{33275}\) by finding the GCD of 72042 and 33275, which is 1 (since they are relatively prime):
\[
\frac{72042}{33275}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compute \(\left(\frac{75}{66}\right) + \left(\frac{81}{61}\right)\), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 66 and 61. Since 66 and 61 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), their least common multiple (LCM) is simply their product:
\[ 66 \times 61 = 4026 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{75}{66} = \frac{75 \times 61}{66 \times 61} = \frac{4575}{4026} \]
\[ \frac{81}{61} = \frac{81 \times 66}{61 \times 66} = \frac{5346}{4026} \]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{4575}{4026} + \frac{5346}{4026} = \frac{4575 + 5346}{4026} = \frac{9921}{4026} \]

To reduce this fraction to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9921 and 4026. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[ 9921 \div 4026 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 1869)} \]
\[ 4026 \div 1869 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 288)} \]
\[ 1869 \div 288 \approx 6 \quad \text{(remainder 165)} \]
\[ 288 \div 165 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 123)} \]
\[ 165 \div 123 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 42)} \]
\[ 123 \div 42 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 39)} \]
\[ 42 \div 39 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 3)} \]
\[ 39 \div 3 = 13 \quad \text{(remainder 0)} \]

The GCD is 3. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[ \frac{9921 \div 3}{4026 \div 3} = \frac{3307}{1342} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we have already computed \(\left(\frac{75}{66}\right) + \left(\frac{81}{61}\right)\) and found it to be \(\frac{3307}{1342}\).

Next, we need to add \(\frac{47}{19}\) to this result. To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{3307}{1342}\) and \(\frac{47}{19}\).

The denominators are 1342 and 19. Since 19 is a prime number, we check if 19 divides 1342:
\[ 1342 \div 19 = 70.6316 \quad \text{(not an integer)} \]

Thus, the least common multiple (LCM) of 1342 and 19 is:
\[ 1342 \times 19 = 25498 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{3307}{1342} = \frac{3307 \times 19}{1342 \times 19} = \frac{62833}{25498} \]
\[ \frac{47}{19} = \frac{47 \times 1342}{19 \times 1342} = \frac{63074}{25498} \]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{62833}{25498} + \frac{63074}{25498} = \frac{62833 + 63074}{25498} = \frac{125907}{25498} \]

To reduce this fraction to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 125907 and 25498. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[ 125907 \div 25498 \approx 4 \quad \text{(remainder 24015)} \]
\[ 25498 \div 24015 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 1483)} \]
\[ 24015 \div 1483 \approx 16 \quad \text{(remainder 287)} \]
\[ 1483 \div 287 \approx 5 \quad \text{(remainder 28)} \]
\[ 287 \div 28 \approx 10 \quad \text{(remainder 7)} \]
\[ 28 \div 7 = 4 \quad \text{(remainder 0)} \]

The GCD is 7. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 7:
\[ \frac{125907 \div 7}{25498 \div 7} = \frac{17987}{3642} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{53}{18}\) and \(\frac{21}{99}\).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 99 is 198. We will convert each fraction to have this common denominator.

1. Convert \(\frac{53}{18}\) to a fraction with denominator 198:
\[
\frac{53}{18} = \frac{53 \times 11}{18 \times 11} = \frac{583}{198}
\]

2. Convert \(\frac{21}{99}\) to a fraction with denominator 198:
\[
\frac{21}{99} = \frac{21 \times 2}{99 \times 2} = \frac{42}{198}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{583}{198} + \frac{42}{198} = \frac{583 + 42}{198} = \frac{625}{198}
\]

Since \(t\) is the sum of these fractions, we have:
\[
t = \frac{625}{198}
\]

We need to find the total sum \(l\) of two identical fractions \(t\):
\[
l = 2t = 2 \times \frac{625}{198} = \frac{2 \times 625}{198} = \frac{1250}{198}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{1250}{198}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1250 and 198. The GCD is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{1250 \div 2}{198 \div 2} = \frac{625}{99}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, recall that the total sum \( l \) of the two identical fractions \( t \) was found to be:
\[
l = \frac{625}{99}
\]

Now, we need to add the fraction \(\frac{99}{92}\) to \( l \):
\[
c = \frac{625}{99} + \frac{99}{92}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 99 and 92 is 9108. We will convert each fraction to have this common denominator.

1. Convert \(\frac{625}{99}\) to a fraction with denominator 9108:
\[
\frac{625}{99} = \frac{625 \times 92}{99 \times 92} = \frac{57500}{9108}

2. Convert \(\frac{99}{92}\) to a fraction with denominator 9108:
\[
\frac{99}{92} = \frac{99 \times 99}{92 \times 99} = \frac{9801}{9108}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[

\]

To simplify \(\frac{67301}{9108}\), we need to check if there is a common divisor for 67301 and 9108. After checking, we find that the greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1, meaning the fraction is already in its simplest form.

1. Convert \(\frac{76}{18}\) to a fraction with denominator 198:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate \( \frac{58}{49} + \frac{31}{34} \).
2. Add the result to \( \frac{74}{38} \).
3. Simplify the final result.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \frac{58}{49} + \frac{31}{34} \)

First, find a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{58}{49} \) and \( \frac{31}{34} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 49 and 34 is 1666.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 1666:

\[
\frac{58}{49} = \frac{58 \times 34}{49 \times 34} = \frac{1972}{1666}
\]

\[
\frac{31}{34} = \frac{31 \times 49}{34 \times 49} = \frac{1519}{1666}
\]

Now, add the fractions:

\[
\frac{1972}{1666} + \frac{1519}{1666} = \frac{1972 + 1519}{1666} = \frac{3491}{1666}
\]

### Step 2: Add the result to \( \frac{74}{38} \)

First, simplify \( \frac{74}{38} \):

\[
\frac{74}{38} = \frac{74 \div 2}{38 \div 2} = \frac{37}{19}
\]

Convert \( \frac{37}{19} \) to have the common denominator 1666:

\[
\frac{37}{19} = \frac{37 \times 88}{19 \times 88} = \frac{3256}{1666}
\]

Now, add \( \frac{3491}{1666} \) and \( \frac{3256}{1666} \):

\[
\frac{3491}{1666} + \frac{3256}{1666} = \frac{3491 + 3256}{1666} = \frac{6747}{1666}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the final result

To simplify \( \frac{6747}{1666} \), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6747 and 1666. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

\[
6747 \div 1666 \approx 4 \quad \text{(remainder 83)}
\]
\[
1666 \div 83 \approx 20 \quad \text{(remainder 6)}
\]
\[
83 \div 6 \approx 13 \quad \text{(remainder 5)}
\]
\[
6 \div 5 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}
\]
\[
5 \div 1 = 5 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 1, so \( \frac{6747}{1666} \) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to calculate each division separately.

1. Calculate \( \frac{100}{76} \):
\[ \frac{100}{76} = \frac{25}{19} \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{29}{14} \):
\[ \frac{29}{14} \]

Now, we need to add these two fractions:
\[ \frac{25}{19} + \frac{29}{14} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 19 and 14 is 266.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 266:
\[ \frac{25}{19} = \frac{25 \times 14}{19 \times 14} = \frac{350}{266} \]
\[ \frac{29}{14} = \frac{29 \times 19}{14 \times 19} = \frac{551}{266} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{350}{266} + \frac{551}{266} = \frac{350 + 551}{266} = \frac{901}{266} \]

Thus, the sum of \( \frac{100}{76} \) and \( \frac{29}{14} \) is \( \frac{901}{266} \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the sum from the previous question:
\[ \frac{100}{76} + \frac{29}{14} = \frac{901}{266} \]

Next, we need to calculate \( \frac{98}{84} \) and subtract it from \( \frac{901}{266} \).

1. Simplify \( \frac{98}{84} \):
\[ \frac{98}{84} = \frac{49}{42} = \frac{7}{6} \]

Now, we need to subtract \( \frac{7}{6} \) from \( \frac{901}{266} \).

To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 266 and 6 is 798.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 798:
\[ \frac{901}{266} = \frac{901 \times 3}{266 \times 3} = \frac{2703}{798} \]
\[ \frac{7}{6} = \frac{7 \times 133}{6 \times 133} = \frac{931}{798} \]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[ \frac{2703}{798} - \frac{931}{798} = \frac{2703 - 931}{798} = \frac{1772}{798} \]

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{1772}{798} \):
Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:
\[ \frac{1772 \div 2}{798 \div 2} = \frac{886}{399} \]

Thus, the new final value is \( \frac{886}{399} \).

\[ \frac{29}{54} \]

Now, we need to add these two fractions:
\[ \frac{25}{19} + \frac{29}{54} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 19 and 54 is 1026.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1026:
\[ \frac{25}{19} = \frac{25 \times 54}{19 \times 54} = \frac{1350}{1026} \]
\[ \frac{29}{54} = \frac{29 \times 19}{54 \times 19} = \frac{551}{1026} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{1350}{1026} + \frac{551}{1026} = \frac{1350 + 551}{1026} = \frac{1901}{1026} \]

Thus, the sum of \( \frac{100}{76} \) and \( \frac{29}{54} \) is \( \frac{1901}{1026} \).

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1901 and 1026. The GCD of 1901 and 1026 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fractions given in the problem.

Evan has read \( \frac{51}{18} \) of his novel. We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 51 and 18.

The prime factorization of 51 is \( 3 \times 17 \).
The prime factorization of 18 is \( 2 \times 3^2 \).

The GCD of 51 and 18 is 3. Therefore, we can simplify \( \frac{51}{18} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[ \frac{51 \div 3}{18 \div 3} = \frac{17}{6} \]

So, Evan has read \( \frac{17}{6} \) of his novel.

Next, Olivia has read \( \frac{8}{42} \) of the novel after reading the same amount as Evan. We can simplify \( \frac{8}{42} \) by finding the GCD of 8 and 42.

The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).
The prime factorization of 42 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 7 \).

The GCD of 8 and 42 is 2. Therefore, we can simplify \( \frac{8}{42} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[ \frac{8 \div 2}{42 \div 2} = \frac{4}{21} \]

So, Olivia has read \( \frac{4}{21} \) of the novel after reading the same amount as Evan.

To find the total amount Olivia has read, we need to add the amount she read initially (same as Evan) and the additional amount:

\[ \frac{17}{6} + \frac{4}{21} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 21 is 42.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 42:

\[ \frac{17}{6} = \frac{17 \times 7}{6 \times 7} = \frac{119}{42} \]
\[ \frac{4}{21} = \frac{4 \times 2}{21 \times 2} = \frac{8}{42} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{119}{42} + \frac{8}{42} = \frac{119 + 8}{42} = \frac{127}{42} \]

The fraction \( \frac{127}{42} \) is already in its simplest form because 127 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 42.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">From the previous question, we know that Olivia has read a total of \( \frac{127}{42} \) of the novel.

Evan initially read \( \frac{17}{6} \) of the novel. We need to add the amount he read initially to the additional amount he read, which is the same as Olivia's total reading:

\[ \frac{17}{6} + \frac{127}{42} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 42 is 42.

Convert \( \frac{17}{6} \) to have a denominator of 42:

\[ \frac{17}{6} = \frac{17 \times 7}{6 \times 7} = \frac{119}{42} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{119}{42} + \frac{127}{42} = \frac{119 + 127}{42} = \frac{246}{42} \]

Next, simplify \( \frac{246}{42} \) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 246 and 42.

The prime factorization of 246 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 41 \).
The prime factorization of 42 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 7 \).

The GCD of 246 and 42 is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \). Therefore, we can simplify \( \frac{246}{42} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 6:

The prime factorization of 18 is \( 2 \times 3^2 \).

The GCD of 51 and 18 is 3. Therefore, we can simplify \( \frac{51}{18} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[ \frac{51 \div 3}{18 \div 3} = \frac{17}{6} \]

So, Evan has read \( \frac{17}{6} \) of his novel.

Next, Olivia initially read \( \frac{3}{42} \) of the novel. We can simplify \( \frac{3}{42} \) by finding the GCD of 3 and 42.

The prime factorization of 3 is \( 3 \).
The prime factorization of 42 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 7 \).

The GCD of 3 and 42 is 3. Therefore, we can simplify \( \frac{3}{42} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[ \frac{3 \div 3}{42 \div 3} = \frac{1}{14} \]

So, Olivia initially read \( \frac{1}{14} \) of the novel.

To find the total amount Olivia has read, we need to add the amount she read initially and the amount she read after reading the same as Evan:

\[ \frac{1}{14} + \frac{17}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 14 and 6 is 42.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 42:

\[ \frac{1}{14} = \frac{1 \times 3}{14 \times 3} = \frac{3}{42} \]
\[ \frac{17}{6} = \frac{17 \times 7}{6 \times 7} = \frac{119}{42} \]

Now, add the fractions:

\[ \frac{3}{42} + \frac{119}{42} = \frac{3 + 119}{42} = \frac{122}{42} \]

We can simplify \( \frac{122}{42} \) by finding the GCD of 122 and 42.

The prime factorization of 122 is \( 2 \times 61 \).
The prime factorization of 42 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 7 \).

The GCD of 122 and 42 is 2. Therefore, we can simplify \( \frac{122}{42} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

2. Subtract this sum from \( \frac{27}{6} \).

### Step 1: Find the value of \( \frac{24}{86} + \frac{76}{77} \)

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{24}{86} \) and \( \frac{76}{77} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 86 and 77 is 86 * 77 (since they are co-prime).

\[ 86 \times 77 = 6622 \]

Now, convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{76}{77} = \frac{76 \times 86}{77 \times 86} = \frac{6536}{6622} \]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[ \frac{1848}{6622} + \frac{6536}{6622} = \frac{1848 + 6536}{6622} = \frac{8384}{6622} \]

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{8384}{6622} \):

Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:

\[ \frac{8384 \div 2}{6622 \div 2} = \frac{4192}{3311} \]

### Step 2: Subtract this sum from \( \frac{27}{6} \)

First, simplify \( \frac{27}{6} \):

\[ \frac{27}{6} = \frac{9 \times 3}{2 \times 3} = \frac{9}{2} \]

Convert \( \frac{9}{2} \) to a fraction with the same denominator as \( \frac{4192}{3311} \):

\[ \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9 \times 3311}{2 \times 3311} = \frac{29899.5}{6622} \]

Now, subtract \( \frac{4192}{3311} \) from \( \frac{29899.5}{6622} \):

\[ \frac{29899.5}{6622} - \frac{4192}{3311} = \frac{29899.5 - 8384}{6622} = \frac{21515.5}{6622} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{73}{39}\) and \(\frac{49}{14}\), we first need to find a common denominator.

1. Identify the denominators: 39 and 14.
2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 39 and 14.

The prime factorization of 39 is \(3 \times 13\).
The prime factorization of 14 is \(2 \times 7\).

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved:
\[ \text{LCM}(39, 14) = 2 \times 3 \times 7 \times 13 = 546 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 546.

For \(\frac{73}{39}\):
\[ \frac{73}{39} = \frac{73 \times 14}{39 \times 14} = \frac{1022}{546} \]

For \(\frac{49}{14}\):
\[ \frac{49}{14} = \frac{49 \times 39}{14 \times 39} = \frac{1911}{546} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{1022}{546} + \frac{1911}{546} = \frac{1022 + 1911}{546} = \frac{2933}{546} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{2933}{546}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2933 and 546.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[ 2933 \div 546 \approx 5 \quad \text{(remainder 203)} \]
\[ 546 \div 203 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 140)} \]
\[ 203 \div 140 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 63)} \]
\[ 140 \div 63 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 14)} \]
\[ 63 \div 14 \approx 4 \quad \text{(remainder 7)} \]
\[ 14 \div 7 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 0)} \]

The GCD is 7.

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{2933 \div 7}{546 \div 7} = \frac{419}{78} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add \(\frac{419}{78}\) and \(\frac{21}{80}\), we need to find a common denominator.

1. Identify the denominators: 78 and 80.
2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 78 and 80.

The prime factorization of 78 is \(2 \times 3 \times 13\).
The prime factorization of 80 is \(2^4 \times 5\).

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved:
\[ \text{LCM}(78, 80) = 2^4 \times 3 \times 5 \times 13 = 1560 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1560.

For \(\frac{419}{78}\):
\[ \frac{419}{78} = \frac{419 \times 20}{78 \times 20} = \frac{8380}{1560} \]

For \(\frac{21}{80}\):
\[ \frac{21}{80} = \frac{21 \times 19.5}{80 \times 19.5} = \frac{409.5}{1560} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{8380}{1560} + \frac{409.5}{1560} = \frac{8380 + 409.5}{1560} = \frac{8789.5}{1560} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{8789.5}{1560}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8789.5 and 1560.

Since 8789.5 is not an integer, it seems there was a mistake in the multiplication step. Let's correct it:

For \(\frac{21}{80}\):
\[ \frac{21}{80} = \frac{21 \times 19.5}{80 \times 19.5} = \frac{409.5}{1560} \]

This should be:
\[ \frac{21}{80} = \frac{21 \times 19.5}{80 \times 19.5} = \frac{409.5}{1560} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{8380}{1560} + \frac{409.5}{1560} = \frac{8789.5}{1560} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{8789.5}{1560}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8789.5 and 1560.

This should be:

Now, we add the two fractions:

The prime factorization of 6 is \(2 \times 3\).
The prime factorization of 14 is \(2 \times 7\).

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved:
\[ \text{LCM}(6, 14) = 2 \times 3 \times 7 = 42 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 42.

For \(\frac{73}{6}\):
\[ \frac{73}{6} = \frac{73 \times 7}{6 \times 7} = \frac{511}{42} \]

For \(\frac{49}{14}\):
\[ \frac{49}{14} = \frac{49 \times 3}{14 \times 3} = \frac{147}{42} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{511}{42} + \frac{147}{42} = \frac{511 + 147}{42} = \frac{658}{42} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{658}{42}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 658 and 42.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[ 658 \div 42 \approx 15 \quad \text{(remainder 28)} \]
\[ 42 \div 28 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 14)} \]
\[ 28 \div 14 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 0)} \]

The GCD is 14.

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{658 \div 14}{42 \div 14} = \frac{47}{3} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{75}{65}\) and \(\frac{7}{39}\), we first simplify each fraction.

1. Simplify \(\frac{75}{65}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 75 and 65 is 5.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
     \[
     \frac{75 \div 5}{65 \div 5} = \frac{15}{13}
     \]

2. Simplify \(\frac{7}{39}\):
   - The GCD of 7 and 39 is 1 (since 7 is a prime number and does not divide 39).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{7}{39}\) is already in its simplest form.

Next, we need to find a common denominator to add the fractions \(\frac{15}{13}\) and \(\frac{7}{39}\).

3. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 39:
   - Since 39 is a multiple of 13, the LCM is 39.

4. Convert \(\frac{15}{13}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 39:
   - Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
     \[

Now, add the fractions \(\frac{45}{39}\) and \(\frac{7}{39}\):
\[
\frac{45}{39} + \frac{7}{39} = \frac{45 + 7}{39} = \frac{52}{39}

Finally, simplify \(\frac{52}{39}\):
- The GCD of 52 and 39 is 1 (since 52 and 39 have no common factors other than 1).

1. The fractions we need to add are \(\frac{52}{39}\) and \(\frac{65}{97}\).

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 39 and 97:
   - Since 39 and 97 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM is simply their product:
     \[
     39 \times 97 = 3783
     \]

3. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 3783:
   - For \(\frac{52}{39}\):

   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5:

2. Simplify \(\frac{7}{47}\):
   - The GCD of 7 and 47 is 1 (since 7 and 47 are both prime numbers and do not divide each other).

3. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 47:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate \( \frac{79}{1} - \frac{30}{92} \).

1. \( \frac{79}{1} \) is simply 79.
2. To subtract \( \frac{30}{92} \) from 79, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 and 92 is 92.

So, we convert 79 to a fraction with a denominator of 92:
\[ 79 = \frac{79 \times 92}{92} = \frac{7268}{92} \]

Now, we subtract \( \frac{30}{92} \) from \( \frac{7268}{92} \):
\[ \frac{7268}{92} - \frac{30}{92} = \frac{7268 - 30}{92} = \frac{7238}{92} \]

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{61}{63} \) from \( \frac{7238}{92} \).

To do this, we need a common denominator for 92 and 63. The least common multiple (LCM) of 92 and 63 is 5796.

Convert both fractions to have the denominator 5796:
\[ \frac{7238}{92} = \frac{7238 \times 63}{92 \times 63} = \frac{456994}{5796} \]
\[ \frac{61}{63} = \frac{61 \times 92}{63 \times 92} = \frac{5612}{5796} \]

Now, subtract \( \frac{5612}{5796} \) from \( \frac{456994}{5796} \):
\[ \frac{456994}{5796} - \frac{5612}{5796} = \frac{456994 - 5612}{5796} = \frac{451382}{5796} \]

Simplify the fraction \( \frac{451382}{5796} \):
\[ \frac{451382}{5796} = 77.88 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to calculate the value of each fraction separately:

\[
\frac{58}{26}
\]

We can simplify \(\frac{58}{26}\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 58 and 26. The GCD of 58 and 26 is 2. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[
\frac{58 \div 2}{26 \div 2} = \frac{29}{13}
\]

Now, we need to add the two simplified fractions:

\[
\frac{29}{13} + \frac{29}{13}
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators directly:

\[
\frac{29 + 29}{13} = \frac{58}{13}
\]

Thus, the simplest form of \((\frac{58}{26}) + (\frac{58}{26})\) is:

\[
\frac{58}{13}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we have already calculated twice the fraction \(\frac{58}{26}\) in the previous problem, which is:

\[
2 \times \frac{58}{26} = \frac{58}{13}
\]

Next, we need to add \(\frac{49}{66}\) to \(\frac{58}{13}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 66 is 66.

We convert \(\frac{58}{13}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 66:

\[
\frac{58}{13} = \frac{58 \times 5}{13 \times 5} = \frac{290}{66}
\]

Now, we add \(\frac{290}{66}\) and \(\frac{49}{66}\):

\[
\frac{290}{66} + \frac{49}{66} = \frac{290 + 49}{66} = \frac{339}{66}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{339}{66}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 339 and 66. The GCD of 339 and 66 is 3. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{339 \div 3}{66 \div 3} = \frac{113}{22}

Thus, the final simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of orange juice Alex has, we need to add the fractions step by step.

First, let's add the initial amounts:
\[ \frac{69}{63} + \frac{77}{5} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 63 and 5 is 315.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 315:
\[ \frac{69}{63} = \frac{69 \times 5}{63 \times 5} = \frac{345}{315} \]
\[ \frac{77}{5} = \frac{77 \times 63}{5 \times 63} = \frac{4851}{315} \]

Now add these fractions:
\[ \frac{345}{315} + \frac{4851}{315} = \frac{345 + 4851}{315} = \frac{5196}{315} \]

Next, simplify the fraction \(\frac{5196}{315}\):
\[ \frac{5196 \div 3}{315 \div 3} = \frac{1732}{105} \]

Now, Alex received an additional \(\frac{47}{71}\) gallons from Sally. We need to add this to the previous total:
\[ \frac{1732}{105} + \frac{47}{71} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The LCM of 105 and 71 is 7455.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 7455:
\[ \frac{1732}{105} = \frac{1732 \times 71}{105 \times 71} = \frac{122972}{7455} \]
\[ \frac{47}{71} = \frac{47 \times 105}{71 \times 105} = \frac{4935}{7455} \]

Now add these fractions:
\[ \frac{122972}{7455} + \frac{4935}{7455} = \frac{122972 + 4935}{7455} = \frac{127907}{7455} \]

Simplify the fraction \(\frac{127907}{7455}\):
\[ \frac{127907 \div 1}{7455 \div 1} = \frac{127907}{7455} \]

Since 127907 and 7455 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 276835:

First, let's add the initial amounts:
\[ \frac{69}{63} + \frac{77}{47} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 63 and 47 is 2961.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 2961:
\[ \frac{69}{63} = \frac{69 \times 47}{63 \times 47} = \frac{3243}{2961} \]
\[ \frac{77}{47} = \frac{77 \times 63}{47 \times 63} = \frac{4851}{2961} \]

Now add these fractions:
\[ \frac{3243}{2961} + \frac{4851}{2961} = \frac{3243 + 4851}{2961} = \frac{8094}{2961} \]

Next, simplify the fraction \(\frac{8094}{2961}\):
\[ \frac{8094 \div 3}{2961 \div 3} = \frac{2698}{987} \]

Now, Alex received an additional \(\frac{47}{71}\) gallons from Sally. We need to add this to the previous total:

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The LCM of 987 and 71 is 70077.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 70077:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{100}{61}\right) + \left(\frac{39}{6}\right) + \left(\frac{67}{49}\right)\), we need to add the fractions step by step.

First, let's simplify each fraction individually if possible:

1. \(\frac{100}{61}\) is already in its simplest form.
2. \(\frac{39}{6}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
   \[
   \frac{39}{6} = \frac{39 \div 3}{6 \div 3} = \frac{13}{2}
   \]
3. \(\frac{67}{49}\) is already in its simplest form.

Now, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 61, 2, and 49 is 5978.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 5978:

1. \(\frac{100}{61}\):
   \[
   \frac{100}{61} = \frac{100 \times 98}{61 \times 98} = \frac{9800}{5978}
   \]

2. \(\frac{13}{2}\):
   \[
   \frac{13}{2} = \frac{13 \times 2989}{2 \times 2989} = \frac{38857}{5978}
   \]

3. \(\frac{67}{49}\):
   \[
   \frac{67}{49} = \frac{67 \times 122}{49 \times 122} = \frac{8174}{5978}
   \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{9800}{5978} + \frac{38857}{5978} + \frac{8174}{5978} = \frac{9800 + 38857 + 8174}{5978} = \frac{56831}{5978}

\[

\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{113662}{5978}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 113662 and 5978. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(113662 \div 5978 \approx 19\) (quotient), remainder \(113662 - 19 \times 5978 = 0\).

Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is 5978.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{100}{61}\right) + \left(\frac{39}{42}\right) + \left(\frac{67}{49}\right)\), we need to add the fractions step by step.

First, let's simplify each fraction individually if possible:

1. \(\frac{100}{61}\) is already in its simplest form.
2. \(\frac{39}{42}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
   \[
   \frac{39}{42} = \frac{39 \div 3}{42 \div 3} = \frac{13}{14}
   \]
3. \(\frac{67}{49}\) is already in its simplest form.

Now, we need to find a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 61, 14, and 49 is 4214.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 4214:

1. \(\frac{100}{61}\):
   \[
   \frac{100}{61} = \frac{100 \times 69}{61 \times 69} = \frac{6900}{4214}
   \]

2. \(\frac{13}{14}\):
   \[
   \frac{13}{14} = \frac{13 \times 301}{14 \times 301} = \frac{3913}{4214}
   \]

3. \(\frac{67}{49}\):
   \[
   \frac{67}{49} = \frac{67 \times 86}{49 \times 86} = \frac{5762}{4214}
   \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{6900}{4214} + \frac{3913}{4214} + \frac{5762}{4214} = \frac{6900 + 3913 + 5762}{4214} = \frac{16575}{4214}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{16575}{4214}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 (since 16575 and 4214 have no common factors other than 1).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \( \frac{85}{1} \) and \( \frac{83}{69} \), we first recognize that \( \frac{85}{1} \) is simply 85.

Next, we need to add \( 85 \) and \( \frac{83}{69} \). To do this, we convert 85 to a fraction with a common denominator of 69:

\[ 85 = \frac{85 \times 69}{69} = \frac{5865}{69} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[ \frac{5865}{69} + \frac{83}{69} = \frac{5865 + 83}{69} = \frac{5948}{69} \]

To simplify \( \frac{5948}{69} \), we check if the numerator and the denominator have any common factors. We find that 5948 divided by 69 equals 86:

\[ \frac{5948}{69} = 86 \]

Thus, the sum of \( \frac{85}{1} \) and \( \frac{83}{69} \) simplifies to 86.

            What is the sum of 92/13 and 43/86 as a simplified fraction?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify each fraction individually.

1. Simplify \( \frac{92}{13} \):
   - Since 92 divided by 13 equals 7 with no remainder, \( \frac{92}{13} = 7 \).

2. Simplify \( \frac{43}{86} \):
   - Notice that 43 is a factor of 86, specifically \( 86 = 2 \times 43 \).
   - Therefore, \( \frac{43}{86} = \frac{43}{2 \times 43} = \frac{1}{2} \).

Now, we add the simplified fractions:
\[ 7 + \frac{1}{2} \]

To add these, we convert 7 to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[ 7 = \frac{14}{2} \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{14}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{14 + 1}{2} = \frac{15}{2} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \(\frac{67}{32}\) and \(\frac{10}{98}\), we first need to express both fractions with a common denominator.

1. Simplify \(\frac{10}{98}\):
   \[
   \frac{10}{98} = \frac{10 \div 2}{98 \div 2} = \frac{5}{49}
   \]

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 32 and 49:
   - The prime factorization of 32 is \(2^5\).
   - The prime factorization of 49 is \(7^2\).
   - The LCM is \(2^5 \times 7^2 = 32 \times 49 = 1568\).

3. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 1568:
   \[
   \frac{67}{32} = \frac{67 \times 49}{32 \times 49} = \frac{3283}{1568}

   \[
   \frac{5}{49} = \frac{5 \times 32}{49 \times 32} = \frac{160}{1568}

4. Add the fractions:

5. Simplify \(\frac{3443}{1568}\) if possible:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \(\frac{67}{32}\), \(\frac{10}{98}\), and \(\frac{14}{59}\), we first need to add \(\frac{67}{32}\) and \(\frac{10}{98}\) as we did previously, and then add \(\frac{14}{59}\) to the result.

From the previous calculation, we have:
\[
\frac{67}{32} + \frac{10}{98} = \frac{3443}{1568}
\]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{14}{59}\) to \(\frac{3443}{1568}\).

1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 1568 and 59:
   - The prime factorization of 1568 is \(2^5 \times 7^2\).
   - The prime factorization of 59 is \(59\) (since 59 is a prime number).
   - The LCM is \(2^5 \times 7^2 \times 59 = 1568 \times 59 = 92512\).

2. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 92512:
   \[
   \frac{3443}{1568} = \frac{3443 \times 59}{1568 \times 59} = \frac{203137}{92512}

   \[
   \frac{14}{59} = \frac{14 \times 1568}{59 \times 1568} = \frac{21952}{92512}

3. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{203137}{92512} + \frac{21952}{92512} = \frac{203137 + 21952}{92512} = \frac{225089}{92512}
   \]

4. Simplify \(\frac{225089}{92512}\) if possible:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 225089 and 92512 is 1 (since 225089 is a prime number and does not share any factors with 92512).

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{59}{52}\) and \(\frac{70}{32}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 52 and 32 will be our common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 52 and 32:
- \(52 = 2^2 \times 13\)
- \(32 = 2^5\)

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^5\)
- The highest power of 13 is \(13\)

Thus, the LCM of 52 and 32 is \(2^5 \times 13 = 32 \times 13 = 416\).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 416:
- For \(\frac{59}{52}\):
  \[
  \frac{59}{52} = \frac{59 \times 8}{52 \times 8} = \frac{472}{416}
  \]

- For \(\frac{70}{32}\):
  \[
  \frac{70}{32} = \frac{70 \times 13}{32 \times 13} = \frac{910}{416}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{472}{416} + \frac{910}{416} = \frac{472 + 910}{416} = \frac{1382}{416}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{1382}{416}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1382 and 416. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
- \(1382 \div 416 = 3\) remainder \(134\)
- \(416 \div 134 = 3\) remainder \(14\)
- \(134 \div 14 = 9\) remainder \(8\)
- \(14 \div 8 = 1\) remainder \(6\)
- \(8 \div 6 = 1\) remainder \(2\)
- \(6 \div 2 = 3\) remainder \(0\)

The GCD is 2. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{1382 \div 2}{416 \div 2} = \frac{691}{208}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is \(\frac{691}{208}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already found the sum of \(\frac{59}{52}\) and \(\frac{70}{32}\) to be \(\frac{691}{208}\). Now, we need to add this to \(\frac{42}{41}\).

First, we need a common denominator for \(\frac{691}{208}\) and \(\frac{42}{41}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 208 and 41 will be our common denominator.

Since 41 is a prime number and does not divide 208, the LCM is simply \(208 \times 41\):
\[
208 \times 41 = 8528
\]

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 8528:
- For \(\frac{691}{208}\):
  \[
  \frac{691}{208} = \frac{691 \times 41}{208 \times 41} = \frac{28331}{8528}
  \]

- For \(\frac{42}{41}\):
  \[
  \frac{42}{41} = \frac{42 \times 208}{41 \times 208} = \frac{8736}{8528}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{28331}{8528} + \frac{8736}{8528} = \frac{28331 + 8736}{8528} = \frac{37067}{8528}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{37067}{8528}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 37067 and 8528. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
- \(37067 \div 8528 = 4\) remainder \(3875\)
- \(8528 \div 3875 = 2\) remainder \(778\)
- \(3875 \div 778 = 4\) remainder \(863\)
- \(778 \div 863 = 0\) remainder \(778\)
- \(863 \div 778 = 1\) remainder \(85\)
- \(778 \div 85 = 9\) remainder \(13\)
- \(85 \div 13 = 6\) remainder \(7\)
- \(13 \div 7 = 1\) remainder \(6\)
- \(7 \div 6 = 1\) remainder \(1\)
- \(6 \div 1 = 6\) remainder \(0\)

The GCD is 1, meaning \(\frac{37067}{8528}\) is already in its simplest form.

To simplify \(\frac{1502}{416}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1502 and 416. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
- \(1502 \div 416 = 3\) remainder \(254\)
- \(416 \div 254 = 1\) remainder \(162\)
- \(254 \div 162 = 1\) remainder \(92\)
- \(162 \div 92 = 1\) remainder \(70\)
- \(92 \div 70 = 1\) remainder \(22\)
- \(70 \div 22 = 3\) remainder \(4\)
- \(22 \div 4 = 5\) remainder \(2\)
- \(4 \div 2 = 2\) remainder \(0\)

The GCD is 2. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{1502 \div 2}{416 \div 2} = \frac{751}{208}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is \(\frac{751}{208}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to perform the division operations:

1. Calculate \( \frac{48}{5} \):
\[ \frac{48}{5} = 9.6 \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{11}{65} \):
\[ \frac{11}{65} \approx 0.1692 \]

Next, we subtract the result of \( \frac{48}{5} \) from \( \frac{11}{65} \):
\[ 0.1692 - 9.6 = -9.4308 \]

Now, we need to add this result to \( \frac{28}{2} \):
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Finally, add \( -9.4308 \) to \( 14 \):
\[ 14 + (-9.4308) = 14 - 9.4308 = 4.5692 \]

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions \( \frac{20}{52} \) and \( \frac{75}{82} \), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 52 and 82 can be found by determining their prime factorizations:

- \( 52 = 2^2 \times 13 \)
- \( 82 = 2 \times 41 \)

The LCM is \( 2^2 \times 13 \times 41 = 2132 \).

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{20}{52} = \frac{20 \times 41}{52 \times 41} = \frac{820}{2132} \]
\[ \frac{75}{82} = \frac{75 \times 26}{82 \times 26} = \frac{1950}{2132} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[ \frac{820}{2132} + \frac{1950}{2132} = \frac{820 + 1950}{2132} = \frac{2770}{2132} \]

To simplify \( \frac{2770}{2132} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2770 and 2132. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 2770 \div 2132 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 638.
2. \( 2132 \div 638 \) gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 218.
3. \( 638 \div 218 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 202.
4. \( 218 \div 202 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 16.
5. \( 202 \div 16 \) gives a quotient of 12 and a remainder of 10.
6. \( 16 \div 10 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 6.
7. \( 10 \div 6 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 4.
8. \( 6 \div 4 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2.
9. \( 4 \div 2 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0.

The GCD is 2. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[ \frac{2770 \div 2}{2132 \div 2} = \frac{1385}{1066} \]

Thus, the simplified form of \( \frac{20}{52} + \frac{75}{82} \) is \( \frac{1385}{1066} \).

Next, we need to add \( \frac{41}{75} \) to \( \frac{1385}{1066} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1066 and 75 can be found by determining their prime factorizations:

- \( 1066 = 2 \times 533 \)
- \( 75 = 3 \times 5^2 \)

The LCM is \( 2 \times 533 \times 3 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 3 \times 25 \times 533 = 79950 \).

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{1385}{1066} = \frac{1385 \times 75}{1066 \times 75} = \frac{103875}{79950} \]
\[ \frac{41}{75} = \frac{41 \times 1066}{75 \times 1066} = \frac{43706}{79950} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:

To simplify \( \frac{147581}{79950} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 147581 and 79950. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 147581 \div 79950 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 67631.
2. \( 79950 \div 67631 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 12319.
3. \( 67631 \div 12319 \) gives a quotient of 5 and a remainder of 1036.
4. \( 12319 \div 1036 \) gives a quotient of 11 and a remainder of 263.
5. \( 1036 \div 263 \) gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 247.
6. \( 263 \div 247 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 16.

9. \( 7 \div 2 \) gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 1.
10. \( 2 \div 1 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0.

The GCD is 1. Therefore, \( \frac{147581}{79950} \) is already in its simplest form.

1. Simplify \(\frac{92}{84}\):

   \frac{92}{84} = \frac{92 \div 4}{84 \div 4} = \frac{23}{21}
   \]

2. Now, we need to subtract \(\frac{23}{21}\) from \(\frac{31}{5}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 21 is 105.

3. Convert both fractions to have the common denominator of 105:

   \frac{67}{84} \text{ is already in its simplest form since 67 and 84 have no common factors other than 1.}
   \]

2. Now, we need to subtract \(\frac{67}{84}\) from \(\frac{31}{5}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 84 is 420.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{81}{90} \) and \( \frac{94}{49} \).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 90 and 49. The least common multiple (LCM) of 90 and 49 is 4410.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 4410:

\[
\frac{81}{90} = \frac{81 \times 49}{90 \times 49} = \frac{3969}{4410}
\]

\[
\frac{94}{49} = \frac{94 \times 90}{49 \times 90} = \frac{8460}{4410}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{3969}{4410} + \frac{8460}{4410} = \frac{3969 + 8460}{4410} = \frac{12429}{4410}
\]

Next, we need to double this sum:

\[
2 \times \frac{12429}{4410} = \frac{2 \times 12429}{4410} = \frac{24858}{4410}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{24858}{4410} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 24858 and 4410. The GCD is 6.

\[
\frac{24858 \div 6}{4410 \div 6} = \frac{4143}{735}

Thus, the simplified form of \( \frac{24858}{4410} \) is \( \frac{4143}{735} \).

\[
2 \times \left( \frac{81}{90} + \frac{94}{49} \right) = \frac{4143}{735}
\]

Now, we need to subtract \( \frac{36}{43} \) from \( \frac{4143}{735} \).

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 735 and 43. The least common multiple (LCM) of 735 and 43 is 31605.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 31605:

\[
\frac{4143}{735} = \frac{4143 \times 43}{735 \times 43} = \frac{178149}{31605}
\]

\[
\frac{36}{43} = \frac{36 \times 735}{43 \times 735} = \frac{26460}{31605}
\]

Now, we subtract the two fractions:

\[
\frac{178149}{31605} - \frac{26460}{31605} = \frac{178149 - 26460}{31605} = \frac{151689}{31605}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{151689}{31605} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 151689 and 31605. The GCD is 21.

\[
\frac{151689 \div 21}{31605 \div 21} = \frac{7223}{1505}

Thus, the simplified form of \( \frac{151689}{31605} \) is \( \frac{7223}{1505} \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{98}{90} \) and \( \frac{94}{49} \).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 90 and 49. The least common multiple (LCM) of 90 and 49 is 4410.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 4410:

\[
\frac{98}{90} = \frac{98 \times 49}{90 \times 49} = \frac{4802}{4410}
\]

\[
\frac{94}{49} = \frac{94 \times 90}{49 \times 90} = \frac{8460}{4410}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{4802}{4410} + \frac{8460}{4410} = \frac{4802 + 8460}{4410} = \frac{13262}{4410}
\]

Next, we need to double this sum:

\[
2 \times \frac{13262}{4410} = \frac{2 \times 13262}{4410} = \frac{26524}{4410}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{26524}{4410} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 26524 and 4410. The GCD is 2.

\[
\frac{26524 \div 2}{4410 \div 2} = \frac{13262}{2205}
\]

Thus, the simplified form of \( \frac{26524}{4410} \) is \( \frac{13262}{2205} \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the difference between \(\frac{69}{21}\) and \(\frac{10}{92}\), we first need to simplify each fraction if possible.

1. Simplify \(\frac{69}{21}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 69 and 21 is 3.
   - \(\frac{69 \div 3}{21 \div 3} = \frac{23}{7}\).

2. Simplify \(\frac{10}{92}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 92 is 2.
   - \(\frac{10 \div 2}{92 \div 2} = \frac{5}{46}\).

Next, we need to find a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 46 is 322.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 322:
- \(\frac{23}{7} = \frac{23 \times 46}{7 \times 46} = \frac{1058}{322}\)
- \(\frac{5}{46} = \frac{5 \times 7}{46 \times 7} = \frac{35}{322}\)

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{1058}{322} - \frac{35}{322} = \frac{1058 - 35}{322} = \frac{1023}{322}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{1023}{322}\) is already in its simplest form because 1023 and 322 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the difference between \(\frac{69}{21}\) and \(\frac{10}{92}\) that we previously calculated:

\[
\frac{69}{21} - \frac{10}{92} = \frac{1023}{322}
\]

Next, we need to add \(\frac{24}{46}\) to this difference. First, simplify \(\frac{24}{46}\):

- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 24 and 46 is 2.
- \(\frac{24 \div 2}{46 \div 2} = \frac{12}{23}\).

Now, we need to add \(\frac{1023}{322}\) and \(\frac{12}{23}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 322 and 23 is 322.

Convert \(\frac{12}{23}\) to have the common denominator of 322:
\[
\frac{12}{23} = \frac{12 \times 14}{23 \times 14} = \frac{168}{322}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1023}{322} + \frac{168}{322} = \frac{1023 + 168}{322} = \frac{1191}{322}

The fraction \(\frac{1191}{322}\) is already in its simplest form because 1191 and 322 have no common factors other than 1.

1. Simplify \(\frac{63}{21}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 63 and 21 is 21.
   - \(\frac{63 \div 21}{21 \div 21} = \frac{3}{1} = 3\).

2. Simplify \(\frac{10}{92}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 92 is 2.
   - \(\frac{10 \div 2}{92 \div 2} = \frac{5}{46}\).

Next, we need to subtract these fractions. Since \(\frac{3}{1}\) is an integer, we can convert it to a fraction with the same denominator as \(\frac{5}{46}\):

\[
3 = \frac{3 \times 46}{1 \times 46} = \frac{138}{46}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{138}{46} - \frac{5}{46} = \frac{138 - 5}{46} = \frac{133}{46}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the result of \(\frac{26}{87} + \frac{92}{88}\).

1. Calculate \(\frac{26}{87}\):
   \[
   \frac{26}{87} = \frac{2 \times 13}{3 \times 29} = \frac{2}{3 \times 29/13} = \frac{2}{3 \times 2.23} \approx 0.29885
   \]

2. Calculate \(\frac{92}{88}\):
   \[
   \frac{92}{88} = \frac{92 \div 4}{88 \div 4} = \frac{23}{22} \approx 1.04545
   \]

3. Add the two results:
   \[
   0.29885 + 1.04545 \approx 1.3443
   \]

Next, we need to add this result to \(\frac{26}{57}\).

4. Calculate \(\frac{26}{57}\):
   \[
   \frac{26}{57} = \frac{2 \times 13}{3 \times 19} = \frac{2}{3 \times 1.52} \approx 0.45614
   \]

5. Add the result from step 3 to \(\frac{26}{57}\):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions \( \frac{78}{66} \), \( \frac{28}{6} \), and \( \frac{90}{34} \) together, we first need to simplify each fraction and then find a common denominator.

1. Simplify \( \frac{78}{66} \):
   \[
   \frac{78}{66} = \frac{78 \div 6}{66 \div 6} = \frac{13}{11}
   \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{28}{6} \):
   \[
   \frac{28}{6} = \frac{28 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{14}{3}
   \]

3. Simplify \( \frac{90}{34} \):
   \[
   \frac{90}{34} = \frac{90 \div 2}{34 \div 2} = \frac{45}{17}
   \]

Next, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{13}{11} \), \( \frac{14}{3} \), and \( \frac{45}{17} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 11, 3, and 17 is 561.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 561:

1. Convert \( \frac{13}{11} \):
   \[
   \frac{13}{11} = \frac{13 \times 51}{11 \times 51} = \frac{663}{561}

2. Convert \( \frac{14}{3} \):
   \[
   \frac{14}{3} = \frac{14 \times 187}{3 \times 187} = \frac{2618}{561}

3. Convert \( \frac{45}{17} \):
   \[
   \frac{45}{17} = \frac{45 \times 33}{17 \times 33} = \frac{1485}{561}

Now, add the fractions together:

The least common multiple (LCM) of 561 and 61 is 34221.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 34221:

1. Convert \( \frac{4766}{561} \):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve \(\frac{12}{7} - \frac{9}{23}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 23 is 161 (since 7 and 23 are both prime numbers).

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 161:

\[
\frac{12}{7} = \frac{12 \times 23}{7 \times 23} = \frac{276}{161}
\]

\[
\frac{9}{23} = \frac{9 \times 7}{23 \times 7} = \frac{63}{161}
\]

Now, we subtract the two fractions:

\[
\frac{276}{161} - \frac{63}{161} = \frac{276 - 63}{161} = \frac{213}{161}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{213}{161}\) is already in its simplest form because 213 and 161 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the result of \(\frac{12}{7} - \frac{9}{23}\), which we found to be \(\frac{213}{161}\). We will use this as \(t\).

Now, we need to calculate \(\frac{40}{11} - t\), where \(t = \frac{213}{161}\).

First, we need to find a common denominator for \(\frac{40}{11}\) and \(\frac{213}{161}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 161 is 1771 (since 161 = 7 Ã— 23 and 11 is a prime number).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1771:

\[
\frac{40}{11} = \frac{40 \times 161}{11 \times 161} = \frac{6440}{1771}
\]

\[
\frac{213}{161} = \frac{213 \times 11}{161 \times 11} = \frac{2343}{1771}
\]

Now, we subtract the two fractions:

\[
\frac{6440}{1771} - \frac{2343}{1771} = \frac{6440 - 2343}{1771} = \frac{4097}{1771}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{4097}{1771}\) is already in its simplest form because 4097 and 1771 have no common factors other than 1.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 336:

\[
\frac{12}{7} = \frac{12 \times 48}{7 \times 48} = \frac{576}{336}
\]

\[
\frac{9}{48} = \frac{9 \times 7}{48 \times 7} = \frac{63}{336}
\]

Now, we subtract the two fractions:

\[
\frac{576}{336} - \frac{63}{336} = \frac{576 - 63}{336} = \frac{513}{336}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{513}{336}\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 513 and 336. The GCD of 513 and 336 is 3.

\[
\frac{513 \div 3}{336 \div 3} = \frac{171}{112}

Thus, the simplified form of the fraction is \(\frac{171}{112}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \( \frac{95}{18} \) and \( \frac{51}{61} \), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 61 is 1098, since 18 and 61 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1098:

1. For \( \frac{95}{18} \):
\[ \frac{95}{18} = \frac{95 \times 61}{18 \times 61} = \frac{5795}{1098} \]

2. For \( \frac{51}{61} \):
\[ \frac{51}{61} = \frac{51 \times 18}{61 \times 18} = \frac{918}{1098} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{5795}{1098} + \frac{918}{1098} = \frac{5795 + 918}{1098} = \frac{6713}{1098} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify the fraction \( \frac{45}{27} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 45 and 27 is 9, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 9:

Next, we need to add \( \frac{6713}{1098} \) and \( \frac{5}{3} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1098 and 3 is 1098.

Convert \( \frac{5}{3} \) to have the denominator 1098:

Now, add the two fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the subtraction of the fractions \(\frac{93}{46}\) and \(\frac{51}{84}\), we first simplify each fraction.

1. Simplify \(\frac{93}{46}\):
   \[
   \frac{93}{46} = \frac{93 \div 46}{46 \div 46} = \frac{2}{1} = 2
   \]

2. Simplify \(\frac{51}{84}\):
   We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 51 and 84. The prime factorization of 51 is \(3 \times 17\), and the prime factorization of 84 is \(2^2 \times 3 \times 7\). The common factor is 3.
   \[
   \frac{51}{84} = \frac{51 \div 3}{84 \div 3} = \frac{17}{28}
   \]

Now, we perform the subtraction:
\[
2 - \frac{17}{28}
\]

To subtract these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 1 and 28 is 28. Convert 2 to a fraction with a denominator of 28:
\[
2 = \frac{2 \times 28}{1 \times 28} = \frac{56}{28}
\]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{56}{28} - \frac{17}{28} = \frac{56 - 17}{28} = \frac{39}{28}

The fraction \(\frac{39}{28}\) is already in its simplest form because 39 and 28 have no common factors other than 1.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \( \frac{12}{70} \) and \( \frac{84}{9} \), we first need to find a common denominator. However, since the denominators 70 and 9 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), the common denominator will be their product, which is \( 70 \times 9 = 630 \).

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

1. Convert \( \frac{12}{70} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 630:
\[
\frac{12}{70} = \frac{12 \times 9}{70 \times 9} = \frac{108}{630}
\]

2. Convert \( \frac{84}{9} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 630:
\[
\frac{84}{9} = \frac{84 \times 70}{9 \times 70} = \frac{5880}{630}
\]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{108}{630} + \frac{5880}{630} = \frac{108 + 5880}{630} = \frac{5988}{630}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{5988}{630} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5988 and 630. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 5988 \div 630 \approx 9 \) (remainder 288)
2. \( 630 \div 288 \approx 2 \) (remainder 54)
3. \( 288 \div 54 \approx 5 \) (remainder 18)
4. \( 54 \div 18 = 3 \) (remainder 0)

The GCD is 18. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 18:
\[
\frac{5988 \div 18}{630 \div 18} = \frac{333}{35}
\]

Thus, the simplified form of the sum is:
\[
\frac{333}{35}

1. Subtract \( \frac{40}{92} \) from \( \frac{32}{3} \).
2. Double the result.

First, let's simplify \( \frac{40}{92} \):

\[ \frac{40}{92} = \frac{40 \div 4}{92 \div 4} = \frac{10}{23} \]

Now, we need to subtract \( \frac{10}{23} \) from \( \frac{32}{3} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 23 is 69.

Convert both fractions to have the common denominator of 69:

\[ \frac{32}{3} = \frac{32 \times 23}{3 \times 23} = \frac{736}{69} \]
\[ \frac{10}{23} = \frac{10 \times 3}{23 \times 3} = \frac{30}{69} \]

Now, subtract the fractions:

\[ \frac{736}{69} - \frac{30}{69} = \frac{736 - 30}{69} = \frac{706}{69} \]

Next, double the result:

\[ 2 \times \frac{706}{69} = \frac{2 \times 706}{69} = \frac{1412}{69} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{1412}{69} = \frac{1412 \div 1}{69 \div 1} = \frac{1412}{69} \]

Since 1412 and 69 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

\[ \frac{1412}{69} = \frac{1412 \times 60}{69 \times 60} = \frac{84720}{4140} \]
\[ \frac{79}{60} = \frac{79 \times 69}{60 \times 69} = \frac{5451}{4140} \]

Now, add the fractions:

4. \( 2069 \div 2 \approx 1034 \) remainder \( 1 \)
5. \( 2 \div 1 = 2 \) remainder \( 0 \)

The GCD is 1, so the fraction \(\frac{90171}{4140}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Subtract \( \frac{40}{92} \) from \( \frac{65}{3} \).
2. Double the result.

First, let's simplify \( \frac{40}{92} \):

\[ \frac{40}{92} = \frac{40 \div 4}{92 \div 4} = \frac{10}{23} \]

Now, we need to subtract \( \frac{10}{23} \) from \( \frac{65}{3} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 23 is 69.

Convert both fractions to have the common denominator of 69:

\[ \frac{65}{3} = \frac{65 \times 23}{3 \times 23} = \frac{1495}{69} \]
\[ \frac{10}{23} = \frac{10 \times 3}{23 \times 3} = \frac{30}{69} \]

Now, subtract the fractions:

\[ \frac{1495}{69} - \frac{30}{69} = \frac{1495 - 30}{69} = \frac{1465}{69} \]

Next, double the result:

\[ 2 \times \frac{1465}{69} = \frac{2 \times 1465}{69} = \frac{2930}{69} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \frac{2930}{69} = \frac{2930 \div 1}{69 \div 1} = \frac{2930}{69} \]

Since 2930 and 69 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \( \frac{79}{24} \) and \( \frac{79}{24} \), we add the numerators while keeping the denominator the same:

\[
\frac{79}{24} + \frac{79}{24} = \frac{79 + 79}{24} = \frac{158}{24}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{158}{24} \). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 158 and 24. 

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 158 is \( 2 \times 79 \)
- 24 is \( 2^3 \times 3 \)

The common factor is 2. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[
\frac{158 \div 2}{24 \div 2} = \frac{79}{12}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{91}{76} \) and \( \frac{12}{22} \), we first need to find a common denominator.

1. Simplify \( \frac{12}{22} \):
   \[
   \frac{12}{22} = \frac{6}{11}
   \]

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 76 and 11. Since 76 is \( 4 \times 19 \) and 11 is a prime number, the LCM is \( 76 \times 11 = 836 \).

3. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 836:
   \[
   \frac{91}{76} = \frac{91 \times 11}{76 \times 11} = \frac{1001}{836}

   \[
   \frac{6}{11} = \frac{6 \times 76}{11 \times 76} = \frac{456}{836}

1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 836 and 59. Since 836 is \( 4 \times 209 \) and 59 is a prime number, the LCM is \( 836 \times 59 = 49324 \).

2. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 49324:

1. Add \( \frac{88}{93} \) to \( \frac{6}{47} \).
2. Add the result to \( \frac{92}{4} \).

First, let's find a common denominator for \( \frac{88}{93} \) and \( \frac{6}{47} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 93 and 47 is 4371.

Convert \( \frac{88}{93} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4371:
\[ \frac{88}{93} = \frac{88 \times 47}{93 \times 47} = \frac{4136}{4371} \]

Convert \( \frac{6}{47} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4371:
\[ \frac{6}{47} = \frac{6 \times 93}{47 \times 93} = \frac{558}{4371} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{4136}{4371} + \frac{558}{4371} = \frac{4136 + 558}{4371} = \frac{4694}{4371} \]

Next, simplify \( \frac{4694}{4371} \):
\[ \frac{4694}{4371} = 1 + \frac{323}{4371} \]

Now, add this result to \( \frac{92}{4} \):
\[ \frac{92}{4} = 23 \]

So, we need to add:
\[ 23 + 1 + \frac{323}{4371} = 24 + \frac{323}{4371} \]

Thus, the final result is:

2. Add the result to \( \frac{92}{4} \).
3. Subtract \( \frac{77}{74} \) from the result obtained in step 2.

First, let's find a common denominator for \( \frac{88}{93} \) and \( \frac{6}{47} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 93 and 47 is 4371.

Convert \( \frac{88}{93} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4371:

Convert \( \frac{6}{47} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4371:
\[ \frac{6}{47} = \frac{6 \times 93}{47 \times 93} = \frac{558}{4371} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{4136}{4371} + \frac{558}{4371} = \frac{4136 + 558}{4371} = \frac{4694}{4371} \]

Next, simplify \( \frac{4694}{4371} \):
\[ \frac{4694}{4371} = 1 + \frac{323}{4371} \]

Now, add this result to \( \frac{92}{4} \):
\[ \frac{92}{4} = 23 \]

So, we need to add:
\[ 23 + 1 + \frac{323}{4371} = 24 + \frac{323}{4371} \]

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{77}{74} \) from \( 24 + \frac{323}{4371} \). First, convert \( 24 + \frac{323}{4371} \) to a single fraction with a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4371 and 74 is 323454.

Convert \( 24 + \frac{323}{4371} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 323454:
\[ 24 = \frac{24 \times 4371}{4371} = \frac{104904}{4371} \]
\[ 24 + \frac{323}{4371} = \frac{104904 + 323}{4371} = \frac{105227}{4371} \]

Convert \( \frac{105227}{4371} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 323454:
\[ \frac{105227}{4371} = \frac{105227 \times 74}{4371 \times 74} = \frac{7786798}{323454} \]

Convert \( \frac{77}{74} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 323454:
\[ \frac{77}{74} = \frac{77 \times 4371}{74 \times 4371} = \frac{336567}{323454} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{7786798}{323454} - \frac{336567}{323454} = \frac{7786798 - 336567}{323454} = \frac{7450231}{323454} \]

Thus, the final result is:

\[ \frac{84}{93} = \frac{84 \times 47}{93 \times 47} = \frac{3948}{4371} \]

Convert \( \frac{6}{47} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4371:
\[ \frac{6}{47} = \frac{6 \times 93}{47 \times 93} = \frac{558}{4371} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{3948}{4371} + \frac{558}{4371} = \frac{3948 + 558}{4371} = \frac{4506}{4371} \]

Next, simplify \( \frac{4506}{4371} \):
\[ \frac{4506}{4371} = 1 + \frac{135}{4371} \]

Now, add this result to \( \frac{92}{4} \):
\[ \frac{92}{4} = 23 \]

So, we need to add:
\[ 23 + 1 + \frac{135}{4371} = 24 + \frac{135}{4371} \]

Thus, the final result is:
\[ 24 + \frac{135}{4371} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the fractions \( \frac{95}{83} \) and \( \frac{52}{21} + \frac{75}{67} \).

First, let's find the sum of \( \frac{52}{21} \) and \( \frac{75}{67} \).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 67 is 1407 (since 21 and 67 are coprime).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1407:
\[ \frac{52}{21} = \frac{52 \times 67}{21 \times 67} = \frac{3484}{1407} \]
\[ \frac{75}{67} = \frac{75 \times 21}{67 \times 21} = \frac{1575}{1407} \]

Now, add these fractions:
\[ \frac{3484}{1407} + \frac{1575}{1407} = \frac{3484 + 1575}{1407} = \frac{5059}{1407} \]

Next, we need to add \( \frac{95}{83} \) to \( \frac{5059}{1407} \).

The least common multiple (LCM) of 83 and 1407 is 116781 (since 83 and 1407 are coprime).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 116781:
\[ \frac{95}{83} = \frac{95 \times 1407}{83 \times 1407} = \frac{133665}{116781} \]
\[ \frac{5059}{1407} = \frac{5059 \times 83}{1407 \times 83} = \frac{419897}{116781} \]

Now, add these fractions:
\[ \frac{133665}{116781} + \frac{419897}{116781} = \frac{133665 + 419897}{116781} = \frac{553562}{116781} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{553562}{116781} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 553562 and 116781 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 116781 and 68 is 7937108 (since 116781 and 68 are coprime).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 7937108:
\[ \frac{553562}{116781} = \frac{553562 \times 68}{116781 \times 68} = \frac{37642216}{7937108} \]
\[ \frac{25}{68} = \frac{25 \times 116781}{68 \times 116781} = \frac{2919525}{7937108} \]

Now, subtract these fractions:
\[ \frac{37642216}{7937108} - \frac{2919525}{7937108} = \frac{37642216 - 2919525}{7937108} = \frac{34722691}{7937108} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{34722691}{7937108} \). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 34722691 and 7937108 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 67 is 1407 (since 21 and 67 are coprime).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1407:

\[ \frac{75}{67} = \frac{75 \times 21}{67 \times 21} = \frac{1575}{1407} \]

Now, add these fractions:
\[ \frac{3752}{1407} + \frac{1575}{1407} = \frac{3752 + 1575}{1407} = \frac{5327}{1407} \]

Next, we need to add \( \frac{95}{83} \) to \( \frac{5327}{1407} \).

The least common multiple (LCM) of 83 and 1407 is 116781 (since 83 and 1407 are coprime).

\[ \frac{5327}{1407} = \frac{5327 \times 83}{1407 \times 83} = \frac{442141}{116781} \]

Now, add these fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the value of the expression \(\left(\frac{73}{27}\right) - \left(\frac{23}{48}\right)\), we need to perform the subtraction of these two fractions. First, we need a common denominator.

The denominators are 27 and 48. The least common multiple (LCM) of 27 and 48 can be found by determining the prime factorizations:
- 27 = \(3^3\)
- 48 = \(2^4 \times 3\)

The LCM is the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- LCM = \(2^4 \times 3^3 = 16 \times 27 = 432\)

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 432:
\[
\frac{73}{27} = \frac{73 \times 16}{27 \times 16} = \frac{1168}{432}
\]
\[
\frac{23}{48} = \frac{23 \times 9}{48 \times 9} = \frac{207}{432}
\]

Now, we subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{1168}{432} - \frac{207}{432} = \frac{1168 - 207}{432} = \frac{961}{432}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{961}{432}\) is already in its simplest form because 961 and 432 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the value of the expression \(\left(\frac{73}{27}\right) - \left(\frac{23}{48}\right) - \frac{61}{59}\), we first need to use the result from the previous calculation:

\[
\left(\frac{73}{27}\right) - \left(\frac{23}{48}\right) = \frac{961}{432}
\]

Now, we need to subtract \(\frac{61}{59}\) from \(\frac{961}{432}\). To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{961}{432}\) and \(\frac{61}{59}\).

The denominators are 432 and 59. The least common multiple (LCM) of 432 and 59 can be found by determining the prime factorizations:
- 432 = \(2^4 \times 3^3\)
- 59 is a prime number.

The LCM is the product of these numbers since they have no common factors:
- LCM = \(432 \times 59 = 25488\)

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 25488:
\[
\frac{961}{432} = \frac{961 \times 59}{432 \times 59} = \frac{56799}{25488}
\]
\[
\frac{61}{59} = \frac{61 \times 432}{59 \times 432} = \frac{26352}{25488}
\]

Now, we subtract the fractions:
\[
\frac{56799}{25488} - \frac{26352}{25488} = \frac{56799 - 26352}{25488} = \frac{30447}{25488}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{30447}{25488}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 30447 and 25488. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
30447 \div 25488 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 4959)}
\]
\[
25488 \div 4959 \approx 5 \quad \text{(remainder 273)}
\]
\[
4959 \div 273 \approx 18 \quad \text{(remainder 45)}
\]
\[
273 \div 45 \approx 6 \quad \text{(remainder 3)}
\]
\[
45 \div 3 = 15 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 3. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[
\frac{30447 \div 3}{25488 \div 3} = \frac{10149}{8496}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:
\[
\frac{10149}{8496}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the result from the previous problem:
\[
39 - \frac{70}{23} \approx 35.956521739130435
\]

Now, we need to add this result to \(\frac{92}{67}\).

First, let's convert the previous result into a fraction. We have:
\[
39 - \frac{70}{23} = \frac{897}{23} - \frac{70}{23} = \frac{827}{23}
\]

Next, we need to add \(\frac{827}{23}\) to \(\frac{92}{67}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 23 and 67 is \(23 \times 67 = 1541\).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1541:
\[
\frac{827}{23} = \frac{827 \times 67}{23 \times 67} = \frac{55409}{1541}
\]
\[
\frac{92}{67} = \frac{92 \times 23}{67 \times 23} = \frac{2116}{1541}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{55409}{1541} + \frac{2116}{1541} = \frac{55409 + 2116}{1541} = \frac{57525}{1541}
\]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{57525}{1541}\). Since 57525 and 1541 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

First, convert \( \frac{34}{1} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[ \frac{34}{1} = \frac{34 \times 4}{1 \times 4} = \frac{136}{4} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{136}{4} + \frac{53}{4} = \frac{136 + 53}{4} = \frac{189}{4} \]

Next, we convert \( \frac{189}{4} \) to a mixed number. We do this by dividing 189 by 4:
\[ 189 \div 4 = 47 \text{ remainder } 1 \]

So, \( \frac{189}{4} \) can be written as:

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the result from the previous problem, which was \( 47 \frac{1}{4} \). We can express this as an improper fraction:
\[ 47 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{47 \times 4 + 1}{4} = \frac{188 + 1}{4} = \frac{189}{4} \]

Now, we need to add \( \frac{24}{67} \) to \( \frac{189}{4} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 67 is 268.

Convert both fractions to have the denominator 268:
\[ \frac{189}{4} = \frac{189 \times 67}{4 \times 67} = \frac{12663}{268} \]
\[ \frac{24}{67} = \frac{24 \times 4}{67 \times 4} = \frac{96}{268} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{12663}{268} + \frac{96}{268} = \frac{12663 + 96}{268} = \frac{12759}{268} \]

Next, we convert \( \frac{12759}{268} \) to a mixed number. We do this by dividing 12759 by 268:
\[ 12759 \div 268 \approx 47 \text{ remainder } 155 \]

So, \( \frac{12759}{268} \) can be written as:
\[ 47 \frac{155}{268} \]

We can simplify \( \frac{155}{268} \) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 155 and 268, which is 1 (since 155 and 268 are relatively prime).

Thus, the simplified form is:
\[ 47 \frac{155}{268} \]

First, convert each fraction to have the denominator 388:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \( \frac{3}{36} \) and \( \frac{97}{96} \), we first need to simplify \( \frac{3}{36} \).

1. Simplify \( \frac{3}{36} \):

   \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}
   \]

2. Now, we need a common denominator to add \( \frac{1}{12} \) and \( \frac{97}{96} \). The least common multiple of 12 and 96 is 96.

3. Convert \( \frac{1}{12} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 96:

To add \( \frac{35}{32} \) and \( \frac{55}{69} \), we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 32 and 69 is 2208.

1. Convert \( \frac{35}{32} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 2208:
   \[
   \frac{35}{32} = \frac{35 \times 69}{32 \times 69} = \frac{2415}{2208}

2. Convert \( \frac{55}{69} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 2208:

1. The denominators are 38 and 96. The least common multiple (LCM) of 38 and 96 can be found by their prime factorizations:
   - 38 = 2 Ã— 19
   - 96 = 2^5 Ã— 3

   The LCM is \( 2^5 \times 3 \times 19 = 1824 \).

2. Convert \( \frac{3}{38} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 1824:
   \[
   \frac{3}{38} = \frac{3 \times 48}{38 \times 48} = \frac{144}{1824}

3. Convert \( \frac{97}{96} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 1824:
   \[

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve \(\left(\frac{92}{95}\right) + \left(\frac{4}{74}\right)\), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 95 and 74. The least common multiple (LCM) of 95 and 74 can be found by their prime factorizations:
- 95 = 5 Ã— 19
- 74 = 2 Ã— 37

Since 95 and 74 have no common prime factors, their LCM is \(95 \times 74 = 7030\).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 7030:
\[
\frac{92}{95} = \frac{92 \times 74}{95 \times 74} = \frac{6808}{7030}
\]
\[
\frac{4}{74} = \frac{4 \times 95}{74 \times 95} = \frac{380}{7030}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{6808}{7030} + \frac{380}{7030} = \frac{6808 + 380}{7030} = \frac{7188}{7030}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{7188}{7030}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7188 and 7030. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
7188 - 7030 = 158
\]
\[
7030 \div 158 = 44.4937 \quad \text{(not an integer, so we continue)}
\]
\[
7030 \mod 158 = 94
\]
\[
158 \div 94 = 1.6809 \quad \text{(not an integer, so we continue)}
\]
\[
158 \mod 94 = 64
\]
\[
94 \div 64 = 1.46875 \quad \text{(not an integer, so we continue)}
\]
\[
94 \mod 64 = 30
\]
\[
64 \div 30 = 2.1333 \quad \text{(not an integer, so we continue)}
\]
\[
64 \mod 30 = 4
\]
\[
30 \div 4 = 7.5 \quad \text{(not an integer, so we continue)}
\]
\[
30 \mod 4 = 2
\]
\[
4 \div 2 = 2 \quad \text{(integer, so we stop)}
\]

The GCD is 2. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{7188 \div 2}{7030 \div 2} = \frac{3594}{3515}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:
\[
\frac{3594}{3515}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to add the fractions \(\frac{88}{72}\) and \(\frac{69}{47}\).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 72 and 47 is 72 * 47, since 47 is a prime number and does not share any factors with 72.

Calculate the LCM:
\[ 72 \times 47 = 3384 \]

Now, convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 3384.

For \(\frac{88}{72}\):
\[ \frac{88}{72} = \frac{88 \times 47}{72 \times 47} = \frac{4136}{3384} \]

For \(\frac{69}{47}\):
\[ \frac{69}{47} = \frac{69 \times 72}{47 \times 72} = \frac{4968}{3384} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{4136}{3384} + \frac{4968}{3384} = \frac{4136 + 4968}{3384} = \frac{9104}{3384} \]

Next, simplify the fraction \(\frac{9104}{3384}\). Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9104 and 3384. The GCD is 8.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{9104 \div 8}{3384 \div 8} = \frac{1138}{423} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to add the fractions \(\frac{92}{22}\) and \(\frac{1138}{423}\).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 22 and 423 is 423, since 423 is a multiple of 22 (423 = 22 * 19.227).

Convert \(\frac{92}{22}\) to have the common denominator of 423:
\[ \frac{92}{22} = \frac{92 \times 19.227}{22 \times 19.227} = \frac{1764}{423} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{1764}{423} + \frac{1138}{423} = \frac{1764 + 1138}{423} = \frac{2902}{423} \]

Next, simplify the fraction \(\frac{2902}{423}\). Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2902 and 423. The GCD is 1, meaning the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the value of \(r\) is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much olive oil the wholesaler has left, we need to subtract the amount sold from the initial amount.

The initial amount of olive oil is \(\frac{41}{26}\) barrels.
The amount sold is \(\frac{41}{72}\) barrels.

First, we need a common denominator to subtract these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 26 and 72 is 936.

Convert \(\frac{41}{26}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 936:
\[
\frac{41}{26} = \frac{41 \times 36}{26 \times 36} = \frac{1476}{936}
\]

Convert \(\frac{41}{72}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 936:
\[
\frac{41}{72} = \frac{41 \times 13}{72 \times 13} = \frac{533}{936}
\]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1476}{936} - \frac{533}{936} = \frac{1476 - 533}{936} = \frac{943}{936}
\]

Thus, the wholesaler has \(\frac{943}{936}\) barrels of olive oil left. This fraction can be simplified further by recognizing that both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 1 (since 943 and 936 have no common factors other than 1).

The existing amount of oil is \(\frac{943}{936}\) barrels.
The new shipment contains \(\frac{68}{47}\) barrels.

First, we need a common denominator to add these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 936 and 47 is 43992.

Convert \(\frac{943}{936}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 43992:
\[
\frac{943}{936} = \frac{943 \times 47}{936 \times 47} = \frac{44321}{43992}
\]

Convert \(\frac{68}{47}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 43992:
\[
\frac{68}{47} = \frac{68 \times 936}{47 \times 936} = \frac{63648}{43992}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{44321}{43992} + \frac{63648}{43992} = \frac{44321 + 63648}{43992} = \frac{107969}{43992}
\]

Thus, the total amount of olive oil the wholesaler has is \(\frac{107969}{43992}\) barrels. This fraction can be simplified further by recognizing that both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 1 (since 107969 and 43992 have no common factors other than 1).

1. Convert \(\frac{12}{33}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 66:
\[
\frac{12}{33} = \frac{12 \times 2}{33 \times 2} = \frac{24}{66}

2. Convert \(\frac{49}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 66:
\[
\frac{49}{2} = \frac{49 \times 33}{2 \times 33} = \frac{1617}{66}

3. Add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{24}{66} + \frac{1617}{66} = \frac{24 + 1617}{66} = \frac{1641}{66}

4. Simplify \(\frac{1641}{66}\) if possible. First, we check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1641 and 66. The GCD is 3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fraction \(\frac{17}{94}\) to the previous result \(24 \frac{19}{22}\), we first need to convert \(24 \frac{19}{22}\) to an improper fraction.

1. Convert \(24 \frac{19}{22}\) to an improper fraction:
\[
24 \frac{19}{22} = \frac{24 \times 22 + 19}{22} = \frac{528 + 19}{22} = \frac{547}{22}
\]

2. Find a common denominator for \(\frac{547}{22}\) and \(\frac{17}{94}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 22 and 94 is 1034.

3. Convert \(\frac{547}{22}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 1034:
\[
\frac{547}{22} = \frac{547 \times 47}{22 \times 47} = \frac{25709}{1034}

4. Convert \(\frac{17}{94}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 1034:
\[
\frac{17}{94} = \frac{17 \times 11}{94 \times 11} = \frac{187}{1034}
\]

5. Add the two fractions:
\[

6. Simplify \(\frac{25896}{1034}\) if possible. First, we check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 25896 and 1034. The GCD is 2.

\[
\frac{25896 \div 2}{1034 \div 2} = \frac{12948}{517}

7. Convert \(\frac{12948}{517}\) to a mixed fraction:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add two fractions, we first ensure they have the same denominator. In this case, both fractions are \(\frac{78}{65}\), so they already have the same denominator.

The sum of the two fractions is:
\[
\frac{78}{65} + \frac{78}{65}
\]

When adding fractions with the same denominator, we add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:
\[
\frac{78 + 78}{65} = \frac{156}{65}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{156}{65}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 156 and 65. The GCD of 156 and 65 is 13.

We divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{156 \div 13}{65 \div 13} = \frac{12}{5}
\]

Thus, the simplified result of adding the two fractions is:
\[
\frac{12}{5}
\]

            After obtaining the result from the previous problem, where you added two fractions both equal to 78/65, what would you get if you add the result to 71/32?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add \(\frac{12}{5}\) and \(\frac{71}{32}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 32 is 160.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 160.

For \(\frac{12}{5}\):
\[
\frac{12}{5} = \frac{12 \times 32}{5 \times 32} = \frac{384}{160}
\]

For \(\frac{71}{32}\):
\[
\frac{71}{32} = \frac{71 \times 5}{32 \times 5} = \frac{355}{160}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{384}{160} + \frac{355}{160} = \frac{384 + 355}{160} = \frac{739}{160}
\]

Thus, the result of adding \(\frac{12}{5}\) and \(\frac{71}{32}\) is:
\[
\frac{739}{160}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's identify the fractions we are adding. Each fraction is \(\frac{78}{78}\).

Since \(\frac{78}{78}\) simplifies to 1 (because the numerator and the denominator are the same), we can rewrite the problem as:
\[
1 + 1
\]

Adding these two values together, we get:
\[
1 + 1 = 2

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions \(\frac{16}{7}\) and \(\frac{11}{90}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 90 is 630.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 630:

\[
\frac{16}{7} = \frac{16 \times 90}{7 \times 90} = \frac{1440}{630}
\]

\[
\frac{11}{90} = \frac{11 \times 7}{90 \times 7} = \frac{77}{630}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1440}{630} + \frac{77}{630} = \frac{1440 + 77}{630} = \frac{1517}{630}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{1517}{630}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1517 and 630. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

\[
1517 \div 630 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 257)}
\]
\[
630 \div 257 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 116)}
\]
\[
257 \div 116 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 25)}
\]
\[
116 \div 25 = 4 \quad \text{(remainder 16)}
\]
\[
25 \div 16 = 1 \quad \text{(remainder 9)}
\]
\[
16 \div 9 = 1 \quad \text{(remainder 7)}
\]
\[
9 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{(remainder 2)}
\]
\[
7 \div 2 = 3 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}
\]
\[
2 \div 1 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 1, so the fraction \(\frac{1517}{630}\) is already in its simplest form.

            After finding the sum of 16/7 and 11/90, add your answer to 38/69. What is this new sum, expressed as a simplified fraction?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we have the sum of \(\frac{16}{7}\) and \(\frac{11}{90}\) which is \(\frac{1517}{630}\).

Next, we need to add \(\frac{1517}{630}\) to \(\frac{38}{69}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 630 and 69 is 43470.

We convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 43470:

\[
\frac{1517}{630} = \frac{1517 \times 69}{630 \times 69} = \frac{104673}{43470}
\]

\[
\frac{38}{69} = \frac{38 \times 630}{69 \times 630} = \frac{23940}{43470}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{104673}{43470} + \frac{23940}{43470} = \frac{104673 + 23940}{43470} = \frac{128613}{43470}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{128613}{43470}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 128613 and 43470. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

\[
128613 \div 43470 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 41673)}
\]
\[
43470 \div 41673 = 1 \quad \text{(remainder 1797)}
\]
\[
41673 \div 1797 = 23 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 1797. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 1797:

\[
\frac{128613 \div 1797}{43470 \div 1797} = \frac{71}{24}
\]

            In the previous problem, you calculated the sum of 16/7 and 11/90. Now, let's consider if there were actually 99 parts out of 90 (as strange as that might sound) instead of 11 parts out of 90. What would be the sum of 16/7 and 99/90, expressed as a simplified fraction?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions \(\frac{16}{7}\) and \(\frac{99}{90}\), we again need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 90 is 630.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 630:

\[
\frac{16}{7} = \frac{16 \times 90}{7 \times 90} = \frac{1440}{630}
\]

\[
\frac{99}{90} = \frac{99 \times 7}{90 \times 7} = \frac{693}{630}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1440}{630} + \frac{693}{630} = \frac{1440 + 693}{630} = \frac{2133}{630}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{2133}{630}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2133 and 630. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

\[
2133 \div 630 = 3 \quad \text{(remainder 243)}
\]
\[
630 \div 243 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 144)}
\]
\[
243 \div 144 = 1 \quad \text{(remainder 99)}
\]
\[
144 \div 99 = 1 \quad \text{(remainder 45)}
\]
\[
99 \div 45 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 9)}
\]
\[
45 \div 9 = 5 \quad \text{(remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 9, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 9:

\[
\frac{2133 \div 9}{630 \div 9} = \frac{237}{70}
\]
