    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance Maria covered, we need to calculate the distance she traveled during the 6.7 hours and then add the additional 4.3 miles.

First, we calculate the distance covered in the 6.7 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 11.0 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 6.7 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 73.7 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we add the additional 4.3 miles:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 73.7 \, \text{miles} + 4.3 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 78.0 \, \text{miles} \]

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the new length of Eva's garden after the extension. The original width of the garden is 3 meters, and she extends it by 22.6 meters. Therefore, the new length of the garden is:

\[ \text{New length} = 3 \text{ meters} + 22.6 \text{ meters} = 25.6 \text{ meters} \]

Next, we need to find the total length after the extension, which is given as the width of the original garden times the total length after the extension. Since the width of the original garden is 3 meters, the total length after the extension is:

\[ \text{Total length} = 3 \text{ meters} \times 25.6 \text{ meters} = 76.8 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we can calculate the total area of Eva's garden. The width of the garden remains 3 meters, and the new length is 76.8 meters. Therefore, the total area is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 3 \text{ meters} \times 76.8 \text{ meters} = 230.4 \text{ square meters} \]

        In addition to his trips to the grocery store, Bob also drives an extra 36 miles each week to visit his grandmother. Taking into account his trips to the grocery store and his visits to his grandmother, how many miles does Bob drive in total every week?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We already calculated that Bob drives 36.6 miles each week for his trips to the grocery store.

Now, we need to add the extra 36 miles he drives each week to visit his grandmother.

The total distance Bob drives each week is the sum of the miles driven to the grocery store and the miles driven to visit his grandmother:

\[ 36.6 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} = 72.6 \text{ miles} \]

        In a different scenario, Bob's grandmother lives 36 miles away, instead of the original distance. If Bob were still to visit her and return home three times a week, how many miles would he be driving in total just for these visits?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the distance Bob travels for a single round trip to visit his grandmother. Since he travels 36 miles to her house and 36 miles back home, the total distance for one round trip is:

\[ 36 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} = 72 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total distance Bob travels in a week if he makes this trip 3 times. We multiply the distance of one round trip by the number of trips he makes in a week:

\[ 72 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/week} = 216 \text{ miles/week} \]

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total cost of the fuel for the trip, we need to multiply the cost per gallon by the number of gallons used.

Given:
- Cost per gallon of diesel = $22.49
- Number of gallons used = 38.04

We calculate the total cost as follows:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 22.49 \times 38.04 \]

Now, performing the multiplication:
\[ 22.49 \times 38.04 = 855.5796 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the fuel for the trip is $855.58 (rounded to the nearest cent).

\[ \text{Total fuel cost} = 855.5796 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total fuel cost is $855.58.

Next, we consider the additional cost of snacks:
- Cost of snacks = $41.80

To find the total amount of money spent on the trip after subtracting the cost of the snacks from the total cost of the fuel, we perform the following calculation:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how far the drone can travel in 24 hours at a constant speed of 7.8 km per hour, we use the formula for distance:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Speed = 7.8 km per hour
- Time = 24 hours

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = 7.8 \, \text{km/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Distance} = 7.8 \times 24 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we calculate the distance the drone travels in the initial 24 hours at a constant speed of 7.8 km per hour.

Using the formula for distance:

- Speed = 7.8 km per hour
- Time = 24 hours

\[ \text{Distance} = 7.8 \, \text{km/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours} \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 7.8 \times 24 \]

\[ \text{Distance} = 187.2 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we add the additional 31 km the drone flies after the initial 24 hours.

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 187.2 \, \text{km} + 31 \, \text{km} \]

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">If David only has 28 dollars to begin with and he wants to save this amount over 23 weeks, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the number of weeks.

David has a total of 28 dollars and he wants to save this amount over 23 weeks.

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{28}{23} \]

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. Divide 28 by 23:
\[ 28 \div 23 \approx 1.217 \]

So, David would need to save approximately 1.217 dollars each week.

To simplify the multiplication, we can break it down:

\[ 39 \times 17 = 39 \times (10 + 7) = (39 \times 10) + (39 \times 7) \]

Calculating each part:

We can break this multiplication down for clarity:
\[ 9 \times 27.99 = 9 \times (28 - 0.01) = 9 \times 28 - 9 \times 0.01 \]
\[ 9 \times 28 = 252 \]

\[ 252 - 0.09 = 251.91 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $251.91.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's calculate Stacey's total expenses on books and school supplies:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} + 35 \text{ dollars} = 55 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of the backpack, which is 41 dollars more than her earlier expenses:
\[ 55 \text{ dollars} + 41 \text{ dollars} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the backpack to her earlier expenses to find the total amount of money Stacey spent:
\[ 55 \text{ dollars} + 96 \text{ dollars} = 151 \text{ dollars} \]

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the number of miles the car travels per hour, we need to divide the total distance by the total time.

Given:
- Total distance = 176.0 miles
- Total time = 20.0 hours

We use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{176.0 \text{ miles}}{20.0 \text{ hours}} \]

Performing the division:
\[ \text{Speed} = 8.8 \text{ miles per hour} \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's calculate the monthly installment for the car. The total cost of the car is $303.5756, and it is to be paid off in 19.51 monthly installments.

To find the amount of each monthly installment, we divide the total cost by the number of installments:
\[ \text{Monthly installment} = \frac{303.5756}{19.51} \]

Using a calculator:
\[ \text{Monthly installment} \approx 15.56 \]

Next, we add the cost of car insurance to the monthly installment. The car insurance costs $41.35 per month.

So, the total monthly payment for the car and insurance is:
\[ \text{Total monthly payment} = 15.56 + 41.35 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much money Joanna will have saved after 17.38 weeks, we need to multiply the amount she saves each week by the number of weeks.

Given:

We perform the multiplication:
\[ 32.2 \times 17.38 \]

First, let's break it down step-by-step:

\[ 32.2 \times 17.38 = 32.2 \times (17 + 0.38) \]
\[ = 32.2 \times 17 + 32.2 \times 0.38 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

\[ 32.2 \times 17 = 547.4 \]
\[ 32.2 \times 0.38 = 12.236 \]

Adding these two results together:

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Joanna will have left after saving for 17.38 weeks and using $34.52, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount saved over 17.38 weeks.
2. Subtract the amount she used from the total saved.

First, calculate the total amount saved:
\[ \text{Amount saved per week} = \$32.2 \]
\[ \text{Number of weeks} = 17.38 \]

\[ \text{Total amount saved} = 32.2 \times 17.38 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 32.2 \times 17.38 = 559.636 \]

Next, subtract the amount she used:
\[ \text{Amount used} = \$34.52 \]

\[ \text{Amount left} = 559.636 - 34.52 \]

Perform the subtraction:
\[ 559.636 - 34.52 = 525.116 \]

So, Joanna will have $525.116 left after saving for 17.38 weeks and using $34.52.

        Joanna is saving money to buy a new bike. She plans to save $32.2 each week. What if, instead of saving for 17.38 weeks as it was originally intended, she decides to only save for 15 weeks. How much money will she have by then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Joanna will have saved after 15 weeks, we need to multiply the amount she saves each week by the number of weeks.

Given:
- Amount saved per week = $32.2
- Number of weeks = 15

We perform the multiplication:
\[ 32.2 \times 15 \]

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

\[ 32.2 \times 15 = 32.2 \times (10 + 5) \]
\[ = 32.2 \times 10 + 32.2 \times 5 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

\[ 32.2 \times 10 = 322 \]
\[ 32.2 \times 5 = 161 \]

Adding these two results together:

\[ 322 + 161 = 483 \]

So, Joanna will have saved $483 after 15 weeks.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much money the farmer spends, we need to multiply the cost per bottle by the number of bottles he buys.

The cost per bottle is $16.01, and he buys 17 bottles. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 16.01 \times 17 \]

First, let's break it down step by step:

\[ 16.01 \times 17 = 16.01 \times (10 + 7) \]
\[ = 16.01 \times 10 + 16.01 \times 7 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

\[ 16.01 \times 10 = 160.10 \]
\[ 16.01 \times 7 = 112.07 \]

Add these two results together:

\[ 160.10 + 112.07 = 272.17 \]

So, the farmer spends $272.17 on 17 bottles of pesticide.

\[ = 23 \times 10 + 23 \times 7 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

   \[
   24 + 27.97 = 51.97
   \]

Now, John has $51.97 in his wallet. He buys 17 vintage comic books, each costing the total amount he currently has in his wallet ($51.97).

To find the total amount he spends on the comic books, we multiply the cost of one comic book by the number of comic books:
\[
51.97 \times 17
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[
51.97 \times 17 = 51.97 \times (10 + 7) = (51.97 \times 10) + (51.97 \times 7)
\]
\[
51.97 \times 10 = 519.70
\]
\[
51.97 \times 7 = 363.79
\]
\[
519.70 + 363.79 = 883.49
\]

        Consider the same situation as before, but this time, John initially has $4 in his wallet instead of $19 and again he finds $5 on the street. After adding this to his wallet, he again discovers a forgotten envelope with $27.97 in it, which he also adds to his wallet. He then heads to the same collector's flea market. If he still purchases 17 vintage comic books, each at the new total amount in his wallet, how much does he spend this time on the comic books?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the total amount of money John has before he buys the comic books.

1. John starts with $4 in his wallet.
2. He finds $5 on the street and adds it to his wallet:
   \[
   4 + 5 = 9
   \]
3. He discovers an envelope with $27.97 and adds it to his wallet:
   \[
   9 + 27.97 = 36.97
   \]

Now, John has $36.97 in his wallet. He buys 17 vintage comic books, each costing the total amount he currently has in his wallet ($36.97).

To find the total amount he spends on the comic books, we multiply the cost of one comic book by the number of comic books:
\[
36.97 \times 17
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[
36.97 \times 17 = 36.97 \times (10 + 7) = (36.97 \times 10) + (36.97 \times 7)
\]
\[
36.97 \times 10 = 369.70
\]
\[
36.97 \times 7 = 258.79

\[
369.70 + 258.79 = 628.49

   Now, John has $3.6 left in his wallet.

3. John receives $46.3 from his friend, which is added to his wallet:

We can plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = 6.4 \, \text{mph} \times 43 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Distance} = 6.4 \times 43 \]

First, break it down for easier calculation:

\[ 6.4 \times 43 = 6.4 \times (40 + 3) \]

Revised distance:
\[ 275.2 \, \text{miles} - 10 \, \text{miles} \]

Perform the subtraction:

        Based on the previous problem where a cyclist pedaled a certain distance after a break, assume now the cyclist repeats the same cycle for 7 days. How much distance, in kilometers, does the cyclist cover after resuming from the break over these 7 days?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">From the previous problem, we know that the cyclist pedals 11.6 kilometers after resuming from the break each day.

To find the total distance covered after resuming from the break over 7 days, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days:

Distance pedaled after the break each day: 11.6 kilometers
Number of days: 7

Total distance = 11.6 km/day * 7 days
= 81.2 kilometers

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much distance the cyclist covers after resuming from the break each day, we need to subtract the distance covered before the break from the total distance pedaled each day.

Total distance pedaled each day: 50.0 kilometers
Distance covered before the break each day: 40.0 kilometers

Distance pedaled after the break each day = Total distance pedaled each day - Distance covered before the break each day

John saves $43.36 each week, and he has been saving for 13 weeks. Therefore, we calculate:

First, let's break it down step-by-step:

\[ 43.36 \times 13 = 43.36 \times (10 + 3) \]
\[ = 43.36 \times 10 + 43.36 \times 3 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

        Instead of saving $43.36 each week, suppose John has been saving only $23 each week for the same duration of 13 weeks. How much money would he have saved by the end of this period?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money John would have saved if he saved $23 each week for 13 weeks, we need to multiply the weekly savings amount by the number of weeks.

John saves $23 each week, and he has been saving for 13 weeks. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 23 \times 13 \]

First, let's break it down step-by-step:

\[ 23 \times 13 = 23 \times (10 + 3) \]
\[ = 23 \times 10 + 23 \times 3 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

\[ 23 \times 10 = 230 \]
\[ 23 \times 3 = 69 \]

Add these two results together:

\[ 230 + 69 = 299 \]

So, John would have saved a total of $299.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Mandy has left after buying the book, we need to subtract the cost of the book from the total amount of money she has.

Total money Mandy has: $42.3
Cost of the book: $19.79

Now, we perform the subtraction:
\[ 42.3 - 19.79 \]

Let's align the numbers by their decimal points and subtract:
\[ 
42.30 
-19.79 
\]
First, subtract the hundredths place:
\[ 0 - 9 \] (we need to borrow from the tenths place)
\[ 10 - 9 = 1 \]

Next, subtract the tenths place:
\[ 2 - 7 \] (we need to borrow from the units place)
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \]

Then, subtract the units place:
\[ 1 - 9 \] (we need to borrow from the tens place)
\[ 11 - 9 = 2 \]

Finally, subtract the tens place:
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

So, the result is:

Therefore, Mandy has $22.51 left after buying the book.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many miles Bob will have driven, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Speed = 8.0 miles per hour
- Time = 3.9 hours

We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = 8.0 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3.9 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Distance} = 8.0 \times 3.9 = 31.2 \, \text{miles} \]

        Bob is driving a car at a speed of 8.0 miles per hour. If he drives for 3.9 hours, he will have driven a certain number of miles. After driving for a while, he stops for a break, during which his car cools down by 21 miles of equivalent energy consumption. What's the equivalent distance for the energy remaining in his car?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the equivalent distance for the energy remaining in Bob's car after his break, we need to first calculate the total distance he drove before the break and then subtract the equivalent distance of energy consumption during the break.

1. Calculate the total distance driven before the break:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 8.0 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3.9 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 31.2 \, \text{miles} \]

2. Subtract the equivalent distance of energy consumption during the break:
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Energy Consumption} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 31.2 \, \text{miles} - 21 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 10.2 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to account for the detour that reduces the total distance by 21.2 miles. To find the final distance traveled, we subtract the detour distance from the initial distance:

\[ \text{Final Distance} = 376.8 \, \text{miles} - 21.2 \, \text{miles} \]

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the total amount of money Jerry has after his mom gives him an additional $7.56.

Starting amount: $19.00
Additional amount from mom: $7.56

Total amount after receiving money from mom:
\[ 19.00 + 7.56 = 26.56 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the snack Jerry buys, which is $4.50.

Total amount after buying the snack:

        After producing milk for 28 days, the farmer sells 20 liters to a local cheese producer. How much milk does he have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the total amount of milk produced in 28 days, which we calculated previously as 999.6 liters.

Next, we subtract the 20 liters sold to the local cheese producer from the total amount of milk produced:

\[ 999.6 \text{ liters} - 20 \text{ liters} = 979.6 \text{ liters} \]

        If the cow produced 19 liters of milk a day, instead of 35.7, how much would the cow produce in 28 days?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much milk the cow produces in 28 days at a rate of 19 liters per day, we need to multiply the daily milk production by the number of days.

Daily milk production = 19 liters
Number of days = 28

Total milk production = 19 liters/day * 28 days

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 19 \times 28 = 19 \times (20 + 8) = (19 \times 20) + (19 \times 8) \]

First, calculate \( 19 \times 20 \):

\[ 19 \times 20 = 380 \]

Next, calculate \( 19 \times 8 \):

\[ 19 \times 8 = 152 \]

Now, add the two results together:

\[ 380 + 152 = 532 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much money Mason has now in total, we need to add the amount he saved from his previous week's allowance, the amount he earned this week, and the gift from his grandma.

Mason's previous savings: $34
Mason's earnings this week: $31.4
Gift from his grandma: $27.4

First, we add the previous savings and this week's earnings:
