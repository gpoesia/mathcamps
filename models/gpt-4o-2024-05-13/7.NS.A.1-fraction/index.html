            Math problem: Determine the value of the sum when adding (74 / 63) and (91 / 78).
        </p>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the value of the sum when adding \(\frac{74}{63}\) and \(\frac{91}{78}\), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

1. The denominators are 63 and 78. We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers.
2. The prime factorization of 63 is \(63 = 3^2 \times 7\).
3. The prime factorization of 78 is \(78 = 2 \times 3 \times 13\).
4. The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
   - The highest power of 2 is \(2^1\).
   - The highest power of 3 is \(3^2\).
   - The highest power of 7 is \(7^1\).
   - The highest power of 13 is \(13^1\).

Thus, the LCM of 63 and 78 is \(2^1 \times 3^2 \times 7^1 \times 13^1 = 2 \times 9 \times 7 \times 13 = 1638\).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1638:

\[
\frac{74}{63} = \frac{74 \times 26}{63 \times 26} = \frac{1924}{1638}
\]

\[
\frac{91}{78} = \frac{91 \times 21}{78 \times 21} = \frac{1911}{1638}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1924}{1638} + \frac{1911}{1638} = \frac{1924 + 1911}{1638} = \frac{3835}{1638}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{3835}{1638}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3835 and 1638. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(3835 \div 1638 = 2\) with a remainder of \(559\).
2. \(1638 \div 559 = 2\) with a remainder of \(520\).
3. \(559 \div 520 = 1\) with a remainder of \(39\).
4. \(520 \div 39 = 13\) with a remainder of \(13\).
5. \(39 \div 13 = 3\) with a remainder of \(0\).

The GCD is 13. Therefore, we simplify \(\frac{3835}{1638}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 13:

\[
\frac{3835 \div 13}{1638 \div 13} = \frac{295}{126}
\]

Thus, the value of the sum is \(\frac{295}{126}\).

\[
\frac{295}{126} + \frac{295}{126} = \frac{295 + 295}{126} = \frac{590}{126}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{590}{126}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 590 and 126. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(590 \div 126 = 4\) with a remainder of \(86\).
2. \(126 \div 86 = 1\) with a remainder of \(40\).
3. \(86 \div 40 = 2\) with a remainder of \(6\).
4. \(40 \div 6 = 6\) with a remainder of \(4\).
5. \(6 \div 4 = 1\) with a remainder of \(2\).
6. \(4 \div 2 = 2\) with a remainder of \(0\).

The GCD is 2. Therefore, we simplify \(\frac{590}{126}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[
\frac{590 \div 2}{126 \div 2} = \frac{295}{63}
\]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{295}{126}\) added to itself is \(\frac{295}{63}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the value of the sum when adding \(\frac{35}{63}\) and \(\frac{91}{78}\), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

1. The denominators are 63 and 78. We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers.
2. The prime factorization of 63 is \(63 = 3^2 \times 7\).
3. The prime factorization of 78 is \(78 = 2 \times 3 \times 13\).
4. The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
   - The highest power of 2 is \(2^1\).
   - The highest power of 3 is \(3^2\).
   - The highest power of 7 is \(7^1\).
   - The highest power of 13 is \(13^1\).

Thus, the LCM of 63 and 78 is \(2^1 \times 3^2 \times 7^1 \times 13^1 = 2 \times 9 \times 7 \times 13 = 1638\).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1638:

\[
\frac{35}{63} = \frac{35 \times 26}{63 \times 26} = \frac{910}{1638}
\]

\[
\frac{91}{78} = \frac{91 \times 21}{78 \times 21} = \frac{1911}{1638}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{910}{1638} + \frac{1911}{1638} = \frac{910 + 1911}{1638} = \frac{2821}{1638}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{2821}{1638}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2821 and 1638. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(2821 \div 1638 = 1\) with a remainder of \(1183\).
2. \(1638 \div 1183 = 1\) with a remainder of \(455\).
3. \(1183 \div 455 = 2\) with a remainder of \(273\).
4. \(455 \div 273 = 1\) with a remainder of \(182\).
5. \(273 \div 182 = 1\) with a remainder of \(91\).
6. \(182 \div 91 = 2\) with a remainder of \(0\).

The GCD is 91. Therefore, we simplify \(\frac{2821}{1638}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 91:

\[
\frac{2821 \div 91}{1638 \div 91} = \frac{31}{18}
\]

Thus, the value of the sum is \(\frac{31}{18}\).

2. The fractions we need to subtract are now \(\frac{49}{8}\) and \(\frac{12}{5}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{22}{49} \) and \( \frac{72}{35} \), we first need to find a common denominator. The denominators are 49 and 35. 

The least common multiple (LCM) of 49 and 35 can be found by determining their prime factorizations:
- 49 = \( 7^2 \)
- 35 = \( 5 \times 7 \)

The LCM is the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:
- LCM = \( 5 \times 7^2 = 245 \)

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 245:
- For \( \frac{22}{49} \):
  \[
  \frac{22}{49} = \frac{22 \times 5}{49 \times 5} = \frac{110}{245}
  \]

- For \( \frac{72}{35} \):
  \[
  \frac{72}{35} = \frac{72 \times 7}{35 \times 7} = \frac{504}{245}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{110}{245} + \frac{504}{245} = \frac{110 + 504}{245} = \frac{614}{245}
\]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{614}{245} \) if possible. We check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 614 and 245. The prime factorizations are:
- 614 = \( 2 \times 307 \)
- 245 = \( 5 \times 7^2 \)

Since there are no common factors other than 1, the fraction \( \frac{614}{245} \) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already computed the sum of \( \frac{22}{49} \) and \( \frac{72}{35} \) as \( \frac{614}{245} \).

Now, we need to add \( \frac{614}{245} \) to \( \frac{32}{21} \).

First, we find a common denominator for \( \frac{614}{245} \) and \( \frac{32}{21} \). The denominators are 245 and 21.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 245 and 21 can be found by determining their prime factorizations:
- 245 = \( 5 \times 7^2 \)
- 21 = \( 3 \times 7 \)

The LCM is the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:
- LCM = \( 5 \times 7^2 \times 3 = 735 \)

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 735:
- For \( \frac{614}{245} \):
  \[
  \frac{614}{245} = \frac{614 \times 3}{245 \times 3} = \frac{1842}{735}
  \]

- For \( \frac{32}{21} \):
  \[
  \frac{32}{21} = \frac{32 \times 35}{21 \times 35} = \frac{1120}{735}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1842}{735} + \frac{1120}{735} = \frac{1842 + 1120}{735} = \frac{2962}{735}
\]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{2962}{735} \) if possible. We check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2962 and 735. The prime factorizations are:
- 2962 = \( 2 \times 1481 \)
- 735 = \( 3 \times 5 \times 7^2 \)

Since there are no common factors other than 1, the fraction \( \frac{2962}{735} \) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{22}{34} \) and \( \frac{72}{35} \), we first need to find a common denominator. The denominators are 34 and 35.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 34 and 35 can be found by determining their prime factorizations:
- 34 = \( 2 \times 17 \)
- 35 = \( 5 \times 7 \)

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
- LCM = \( 2 \times 17 \times 5 \times 7 = 1190 \)

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1190:
- For \( \frac{22}{34} \):
  \[
  \frac{22}{34} = \frac{22 \times 35}{34 \times 35} = \frac{770}{1190}
  \]

- For \( \frac{72}{35} \):
  \[
  \frac{72}{35} = \frac{72 \times 34}{35 \times 34} = \frac{2448}{1190}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{770}{1190} + \frac{2448}{1190} = \frac{770 + 2448}{1190} = \frac{3218}{1190}
\]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{3218}{1190} \) if possible. We check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3218 and 1190. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
- 3218 Ã· 1190 = 2 remainder 838
- 1190 Ã· 838 = 1 remainder 352
- 838 Ã· 352 = 2 remainder 134
- 352 Ã· 134 = 2 remainder 84
- 134 Ã· 84 = 1 remainder 50
- 84 Ã· 50 = 1 remainder 34
- 50 Ã· 34 = 1 remainder 16
- 34 Ã· 16 = 2 remainder 2
- 16 Ã· 2 = 8 remainder 0

The GCD is 2. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{3218 \div 2}{1190 \div 2} = \frac{1609}{595}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \(\frac{49}{79}\) and \(\frac{18}{21}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 79 and 21 will be our common denominator.

Since 79 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 21, the LCM of 79 and 21 is simply \(79 \times 21\).

First, calculate \(79 \times 21\):
\[
79 \times 21 = 79 \times (20 + 1) = 79 \times 20 + 79 \times 1 = 1580 + 79 = 1659
\]

Now, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1659.

For \(\frac{49}{79}\):
\[
\frac{49}{79} = \frac{49 \times 21}{79 \times 21} = \frac{1029}{1659}
\]

For \(\frac{18}{21}\):
\[
\frac{18}{21} = \frac{18 \times 79}{21 \times 79} = \frac{1422}{1659}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1029}{1659} + \frac{1422}{1659} = \frac{1029 + 1422}{1659} = \frac{2451}{1659}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{2451}{1659}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2451 and 1659. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(2451 \div 1659 \approx 1\) remainder \(792\)
2. \(1659 \div 792 \approx 2\) remainder \(75\)
3. \(792 \div 75 \approx 10\) remainder \(42\)
4. \(75 \div 42 \approx 1\) remainder \(33\)
5. \(42 \div 33 \approx 1\) remainder \(9\)
6. \(33 \div 9 \approx 3\) remainder \(6\)
7. \(9 \div 6 \approx 1\) remainder \(3\)
8. \(6 \div 3 \approx 2\) remainder \(0\)

The GCD is 3. Therefore, we simplify \(\frac{2451}{1659}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[
\frac{2451 \div 3}{1659 \div 3} = \frac{817}{553}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously found that the sum of \(\frac{49}{79}\) and \(\frac{18}{21}\) is \(\frac{817}{553}\). Let's denote this sum as \(n\). Now, we need to add \(\frac{71}{97}\) to \(n\).

First, we need to find a common denominator for \(\frac{817}{553}\) and \(\frac{71}{97}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 553 and 97 will be our common denominator.

Since 553 and 97 are both prime numbers, we can find the LCM by multiplying them together:
\[
553 \times 97 = 53641
\]

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 53641.

For \(\frac{817}{553}\):
\[
\frac{817}{553} = \frac{817 \times 97}{553 \times 97} = \frac{79249}{53641}
\]

For \(\frac{71}{97}\):
\[
\frac{71}{97} = \frac{71 \times 553}{97 \times 553} = \frac{39263}{53641}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{79249}{53641} + \frac{39263}{53641} = \frac{79249 + 39263}{53641} = \frac{118512}{53641}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{118512}{53641}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 118512 and 53641. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(118512 \div 53641 \approx 2\) remainder \(111230\)
2. \(53641 \div 111230 \approx 0\) remainder \(53641\)

Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is 1. Therefore, \(\frac{118512}{53641}\) is already in its simplest form.

Since 21 is a multiple of 3, the LCM of 3 and 21 is 21.

Now, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 21.

For \(\frac{49}{3}\):
\[
\frac{49}{3} = \frac{49 \times 7}{3 \times 7} = \frac{343}{21}

For \(\frac{18}{21}\):

Now, we add the two fractions:

Next, we check if \(\frac{361}{21}\) can be simplified. We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 361 and 21. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(361 \div 21 \approx 17\) remainder \(4\)

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1426:

1. For \(\frac{95}{46}\):
   \[
   \frac{95}{46} = \frac{95 \times 31}{46 \times 31} = \frac{2945}{1426}

2. For \(\frac{65}{31}\):
   \[
   \frac{65}{31} = \frac{65 \times 46}{31 \times 46} = \frac{2990}{1426}

Now, we add the two fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{31}{46}\) and \(\frac{65}{31}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The denominators are 46 and 31. The least common multiple (LCM) of 46 and 31 is 1426.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1426:

1. For \(\frac{31}{46}\):
   \[
   \frac{31}{46} = \frac{31 \times 31}{46 \times 31} = \frac{961}{1426}
   \]

2. For \(\frac{65}{31}\):
   \[
   \frac{65}{31} = \frac{65 \times 46}{31 \times 46} = \frac{2990}{1426}
   \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{961}{1426} + \frac{2990}{1426} = \frac{961 + 2990}{1426} = \frac{3951}{1426}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{3951}{1426}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3951 and 1426. The GCD is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{25}{63}\) and \(\frac{74}{6}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 63 and 6 is 126.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 126.

1. Convert \(\frac{25}{63}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 126:
\[
\frac{25}{63} = \frac{25 \times 2}{63 \times 2} = \frac{50}{126}
\]

2. Convert \(\frac{74}{6}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 126:
\[
\frac{74}{6} = \frac{74 \times 21}{6 \times 21} = \frac{1554}{126}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{50}{126} + \frac{1554}{126} = \frac{50 + 1554}{126} = \frac{1604}{126}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{1604}{126}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1604 and 126. The GCD is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{1604 \div 2}{126 \div 2} = \frac{802}{63}
\]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{25}{63}\) and \(\frac{74}{6}\) is \(\frac{802}{63}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already found that the sum of \(\frac{25}{63}\) and \(\frac{74}{6}\) is \(\frac{802}{63}\).

Now, we need to subtract \(\frac{9}{47}\) from \(\frac{802}{63}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 63 and 47 is 2961.

First, convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 2961.

1. Convert \(\frac{802}{63}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 2961:
\[
\frac{802}{63} = \frac{802 \times 47}{63 \times 47} = \frac{37694}{2961}
\]

2. Convert \(\frac{9}{47}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 2961:
\[
\frac{9}{47} = \frac{9 \times 63}{47 \times 63} = \frac{567}{2961}
\]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[
\frac{37694}{2961} - \frac{567}{2961} = \frac{37694 - 567}{2961} = \frac{37127}{2961}
\]

Thus, the new value after subtracting \(\frac{9}{47}\) from \(\frac{802}{63}\) is \(\frac{37127}{2961}\).

Now, we add the two fractions:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{79}{91}\) and \(\frac{100}{47}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 91 and 47 will serve as the common denominator.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 91 and 47:
- 91 = 7 Ã— 13
- 47 is a prime number.

Since 47 is prime and does not share any common factors with 91, the LCM of 91 and 47 is simply their product:
\[ \text{LCM}(91, 47) = 91 \times 47 = 4277 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{79}{91} = \frac{79 \times 47}{91 \times 47} = \frac{3713}{4277} \]
\[ \frac{100}{47} = \frac{100 \times 91}{47 \times 91} = \frac{9100}{4277} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{3713}{4277} + \frac{9100}{4277} = \frac{3713 + 9100}{4277} = \frac{12813}{4277} \]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{79}{91}\) and \(\frac{100}{47}\) is \(\frac{12813}{4277}\).

To add this sum to itself, we perform the following calculation:
\[ \frac{12813}{4277} + \frac{12813}{4277} \]

Since the denominators are the same, we can simply add the numerators:
\[ \frac{12813 + 12813}{4277} = \frac{25626}{4277} \]

   This fraction is already in its simplest form. We can approximate it as:

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

1. Convert \(\frac{86}{62}\):
\[
\frac{86}{62} = \frac{86 \times 41}{62 \times 41} = \frac{3526}{2542}

2. Convert \(\frac{99}{41}\):
\[
\frac{99}{41} = \frac{99 \times 62}{41 \times 62} = \frac{6138}{2542}

Now, we can add the two fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the sum of \(\frac{86}{62}\) and \(\frac{99}{41}\) that we calculated previously:

\[
\frac{86}{62} + \frac{99}{41} = \frac{4832}{1271}
\]

Next, we need to subtract \(\frac{57}{52}\) from this sum. To do this, we need a common denominator for \(\frac{4832}{1271}\) and \(\frac{57}{52}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 1271 and 52 is 66172.

First, convert \(\frac{4832}{1271}\) to have the common denominator 66172:
\[
\frac{4832}{1271} = \frac{4832 \times 52}{1271 \times 52} = \frac{251264}{66172}
\]

Next, convert \(\frac{57}{52}\) to have the common denominator 66172:
\[
\frac{57}{52} = \frac{57 \times 1271}{52 \times 1271} = \frac{72447}{66172}
\]

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:
\[
\frac{251264}{66172} - \frac{72447}{66172} = \frac{251264 - 72447}{66172} = \frac{178817}{66172}
\]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{178817}{66172}\). Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 1 (since 178817 and 66172 are coprime):

\[

Thus, the result when you subtract \(\frac{57}{52}\) from the sum of \(\frac{86}{62}\) and \(\frac{99}{41}\) is \(\frac{178817}{66172}\).

2. Convert \(\frac{99}{41}\):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \(\frac{87}{88}\) and \(\frac{24}{13}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 88 and 13 is 1144.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1144:

\[
\frac{87}{88} = \frac{87 \times 13}{88 \times 13} = \frac{1131}{1144}
\]

\[
\frac{24}{13} = \frac{24 \times 88}{13 \times 88} = \frac{2112}{1144}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1131}{1144} + \frac{2112}{1144} = \frac{1131 + 2112}{1144} = \frac{3243}{1144}
\]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{87}{88}\) and \(\frac{24}{13}\) is \(\frac{3243}{1144}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify \(\frac{36}{9}\):

\[
\frac{36}{9} = 4

Next, we add this to the previously calculated sum \(\frac{3243}{1144}\):

\[
4 = \frac{4 \times 1144}{1144} = \frac{4576}{1144}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{3243}{1144} + \frac{4576}{1144} = \frac{3243 + 4576}{1144} = \frac{7819}{1144}

Thus, the result when you add \(\frac{3243}{1144}\) to 4 (or \(\frac{4576}{1144}\)) is \(\frac{7819}{1144}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve \(\left(\frac{68}{33}\right) + \left(\frac{70}{25}\right)\), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 33 and 25. The least common multiple (LCM) of 33 and 25 is 825.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 825:

\[
\frac{68}{33} = \frac{68 \times 25}{33 \times 25} = \frac{1700}{825}
\]

\[
\frac{70}{25} = \frac{70 \times 33}{25 \times 33} = \frac{2310}{825}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1700}{825} + \frac{2310}{825} = \frac{1700 + 2310}{825} = \frac{4010}{825}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{4010}{825}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4010 and 825. The GCD is 5.

\[
\frac{4010 \div 5}{825 \div 5} = \frac{802}{165}
\]

Thus, the simplest form of \(\left(\frac{68}{33}\right) + \left(\frac{70}{25}\right)\) is \(\frac{802}{165}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve \(\left(\frac{802}{165}\right) - \left(\frac{90}{92}\right)\), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 165 and 92. The least common multiple (LCM) of 165 and 92 is 15180.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 15180:

\[
\frac{802}{165} = \frac{802 \times 92}{165 \times 92} = \frac{73784}{15180}
\]

\[
\frac{90}{92} = \frac{90 \times 165}{92 \times 165} = \frac{14850}{15180}
\]

Now, we subtract the second fraction from the first:

\[
\frac{73784}{15180} - \frac{14850}{15180} = \frac{73784 - 14850}{15180} = \frac{58934}{15180}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{58934}{15180}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 58934 and 15180. The GCD is 2.

\[
\frac{58934 \div 2}{15180 \div 2} = \frac{29467}{7590}

Thus, the simplest form of \(\left(\frac{802}{165}\right) - \left(\frac{90}{92}\right)\) is \(\frac{29467}{7590}\).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 825:

\[

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[

To simplify \(\frac{2987}{825}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2987 and 825. The GCD is 1, meaning the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the summation of \( \frac{35}{97} \) and \( \frac{11}{9} \), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 97 and 9 is 873 (since 97 is a prime number and does not share any factors with 9).

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 873:

\[
\frac{35}{97} = \frac{35 \times 9}{97 \times 9} = \frac{315}{873}
\]

\[
\frac{11}{9} = \frac{11 \times 97}{9 \times 97} = \frac{1067}{873}

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{315}{873} + \frac{1067}{873} = \frac{315 + 1067}{873} = \frac{1382}{873}

Next, we simplify \( \frac{1382}{873} \) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1382 and 873. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 1382 \div 873 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 509.
2. \( 873 \div 509 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 364.
3. \( 509 \div 364 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 145.

We convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 21825:

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1455:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem of subtracting \(\frac{79}{70}\) from \(\frac{11}{5}\), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 70 and 5. The least common multiple (LCM) of 70 and 5 is 70.

Next, we convert \(\frac{11}{5}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 70:
\[
\frac{11}{5} = \frac{11 \times 14}{5 \times 14} = \frac{154}{70}
\]

Now we can subtract \(\frac{79}{70}\) from \(\frac{154}{70}\):
\[
\frac{154}{70} - \frac{79}{70} = \frac{154 - 79}{70} = \frac{75}{70}
\]

We can simplify \(\frac{75}{70}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 5:
\[
\frac{75 \div 5}{70 \div 5} = \frac{15}{14}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem of adding \(\frac{62}{46}\) to \(\frac{15}{14}\), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 46 and 14. The least common multiple (LCM) of 46 and 14 is 322.

Next, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 322.

First, convert \(\frac{15}{14}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 322:
\[
\frac{15}{14} = \frac{15 \times 23}{14 \times 23} = \frac{345}{322}
\]

Next, convert \(\frac{62}{46}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 322:
\[
\frac{62}{46} = \frac{62 \times 7}{46 \times 7} = \frac{434}{322}
\]

Now we can add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{345}{322} + \frac{434}{322} = \frac{345 + 434}{322} = \frac{779}{322}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \(\frac{68}{16}\) and \(\frac{52}{78}\), we first simplify each fraction.

1. Simplify \(\frac{68}{16}\):

Next, we need to find a common denominator to add the fractions \(\frac{17}{4}\) and \(\frac{2}{3}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 3 is 12.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 12:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{21}{75} \) and \( \frac{44}{47} \), we need to find a common denominator. The denominators are 75 and 47, which are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1). Therefore, the common denominator is their product: \( 75 \times 47 \).

First, calculate \( 75 \times 47 \):
\[ 75 \times 47 = 75 \times (50 - 3) = 75 \times 50 - 75 \times 3 = 3750 - 225 = 3525 \]

Next, convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{21}{75} = \frac{21 \times 47}{75 \times 47} = \frac{987}{3525} \]
\[ \frac{44}{47} = \frac{44 \times 75}{47 \times 75} = \frac{3300}{3525} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{987}{3525} + \frac{3300}{3525} = \frac{987 + 3300}{3525} = \frac{4287}{3525} \]

The fraction \( \frac{4287}{3525} \) can be simplified if there is a common factor. Let's check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4287 and 3525.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[ 4287 \div 3525 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 762)} \]
\[ 3525 \div 762 \approx 4 \quad \text{(remainder 477)} \]
\[ 762 \div 477 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 285)} \]
\[ 477 \div 285 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 192)} \]
\[ 285 \div 192 \approx 1 \quad \text{(remainder 93)} \]
\[ 192 \div 93 \approx 2 \quad \text{(remainder 6)} \]
\[ 93 \div 6 \approx 15 \quad \text{(remainder 3)} \]
\[ 6 \div 3 = 2 \quad \text{(remainder 0)} \]

The GCD is 3. Therefore, we can simplify \( \frac{4287}{3525} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[ \frac{4287 \div 3}{3525 \div 3} = \frac{1429}{1175} \]

Next, we check if \(\frac{2858}{1175}\) can be simplified. We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2858 and 1175.

\[ \frac{21}{63} = \frac{21 \div 21}{63 \div 21} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the sum of \( \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \frac{44}{47} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 3 and 47, which are relatively prime. Therefore, the common denominator is their product: \( 3 \times 47 = 141 \).

\[ \frac{847}{55} + \frac{20}{55} = \frac{847 + 20}{55} = \frac{867}{55} \]

To simplify \(\frac{867}{55}\), we check if the numerator and the denominator have any common factors. Since 867 and 55 do not have any common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the result of \(\frac{77}{5} + \frac{4}{11}\) is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we have the result from the previous calculation:
\[ \frac{77}{5} + \frac{4}{11} = \frac{867}{55} \]

Now, we need to add this result to \(\frac{94}{60}\).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The denominators are 55 and 60. We find the least common multiple (LCM) of 55 and 60.

Prime factorization:
\[ 55 = 5 \times 11 \]
\[ 60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \]

The LCM is:
\[ \text{LCM}(55, 60) = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 11 = 660 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator of 660.

For \(\frac{867}{55}\):
\[ \frac{867}{55} = \frac{867 \times 12}{55 \times 12} = \frac{10404}{660} \]

For \(\frac{94}{60}\):
\[ \frac{94}{60} = \frac{94 \times 11}{60 \times 11} = \frac{1034}{660} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{10404}{660} + \frac{1034}{660} = \frac{10404 + 1034}{660} = \frac{11438}{660} \]

To simplify \(\frac{11438}{660}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 11438 and 660. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 11438 \div 660 \approx 17 \) remainder \( 158 \)
2. \( 660 \div 158 \approx 4 \) remainder \( 28 \)
3. \( 158 \div 28 \approx 5 \) remainder \( 18 \)
4. \( 28 \div 18 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 10 \)
5. \( 18 \div 10 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 8 \)
6. \( 10 \div 8 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 2 \)
7. \( 8 \div 2 = 4 \) remainder \( 0 \)

The GCD is 2.

Now, we simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{11438 \div 2}{660 \div 2} = \frac{5719}{330} \]

Thus, the final answer is:

            Instead of the original problem (77/5 + 4/11), consider a change such that now we are adding 77/5 and 4/79 instead.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the new expression \(\frac{77}{5} + \frac{4}{79}\), we need to find a common denominator.

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 79. Since 5 and 79 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product:
\[ \text{LCM}(5, 79) = 5 \times 79 = 395 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator of 395.

For \(\frac{77}{5}\):
\[ \frac{77}{5} = \frac{77 \times 79}{5 \times 79} = \frac{6083}{395} \]

For \(\frac{4}{79}\):
\[ \frac{4}{79} = \frac{4 \times 5}{79 \times 5} = \frac{20}{395} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{6083}{395} + \frac{20}{395} = \frac{6083 + 20}{395} = \frac{6103}{395} \]

To simplify \(\frac{6103}{395}\), we check if the numerator and the denominator have any common factors. Since 6103 and 395 do not have any common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the result of \(\frac{77}{5} + \frac{4}{79}\) is:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{60}{48}\) and \(\frac{37}{47}\), we first need to simplify \(\frac{60}{48}\) if possible and then find a common denominator for the addition.

1. Simplify \(\frac{60}{48}\):
   \[
   \frac{60}{48} = \frac{60 \div 12}{48 \div 12} = \frac{5}{4}
   \]

2. Now, we need to add \(\frac{5}{4}\) and \(\frac{37}{47}\). To do this, we find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 47 is \(4 \times 47 = 188\).

3. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 188:
   \[
   \frac{5}{4} = \frac{5 \times 47}{4 \times 47} = \frac{235}{188}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{37}{47} = \frac{37 \times 4}{47 \times 4} = \frac{148}{188}
   \]

4. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{235}{188} + \frac{148}{188} = \frac{235 + 148}{188} = \frac{383}{188}

Next, we need to add \(\frac{35}{35}\) to this result. Note that \(\frac{35}{35}\) simplifies to 1.

To add \(\frac{383}{188}\) and 1, we need to express 1 with the same denominator as \(\frac{383}{188}\):
\[
1 = \frac{188}{188}

Now, we can add the two fractions:

1. Simplify \(\frac{60}{45}\):

   \frac{60}{45} = \frac{60 \div 15}{45 \div 15} = \frac{4}{3}

2. Now, we need to add \(\frac{4}{3}\) and \(\frac{37}{47}\). To do this, we find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 47 is \(3 \times 47 = 141\).

3. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 141:

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 13774:

\[
\frac{2593}{194} = \frac{2593 \times 71}{194 \times 71} = \frac{184103}{13774}
\]

\[
\frac{100}{71} = \frac{100 \times 194}{71 \times 194} = \frac{19400}{13774}
\]

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:

\[
\frac{184103}{13774} - \frac{19400}{13774} = \frac{184103 - 19400}{13774} = \frac{164703}{13774}

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 96:

\[
\frac{84}{96} \text{ is already in terms of 96.}
\]

\[
\frac{25}{2} = \frac{25 \times 48}{2 \times 48} = \frac{1200}{96}

Now, we can add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{84}{96} + \frac{1200}{96} = \frac{84 + 1200}{96} = \frac{1284}{96}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{1284}{96}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1284 and 96. The GCD is 12.

\[

            What is the sum of 95/57 and 28/80?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{95}{57}\) and \(\frac{28}{80}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 57 and 80 will be our common denominator.

1. **Find the LCM of 57 and 80:**
   - The prime factorization of 57 is \(3 \times 19\).
   - The prime factorization of 80 is \(2^4 \times 5\).

   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
   - LCM = \(2^4 \times 3 \times 5 \times 19 = 16 \times 3 \times 5 \times 19\).

   Let's calculate this step-by-step:
   - \(16 \times 3 = 48\)
   - \(48 \times 5 = 240\)
   - \(240 \times 19 = 4560\)

   So, the LCM of 57 and 80 is 4560.

2. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 4560:**
   - For \(\frac{95}{57}\):
     \[
     \frac{95}{57} = \frac{95 \times 80}{57 \times 80} = \frac{7600}{4560}
     \]

   - For \(\frac{28}{80}\):
     \[
     \frac{28}{80} = \frac{28 \times 57}{80 \times 57} = \frac{1596}{4560}
     \]

3. **Add the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{7600}{4560} + \frac{1596}{4560} = \frac{7600 + 1596}{4560} = \frac{9196}{4560}
   \]

4. **Simplify the fraction \(\frac{9196}{4560}\):**
   - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9196 and 4560. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
     - \(9196 \div 4560 \approx 2\) remainder 76
     - \(4560 \div 76 \approx 60\) remainder 0

     The GCD is 76.

   - Simplify by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 76:
     \[
     \frac{9196 \div 76}{4560 \div 76} = \frac{121}{60}
     \]

So, the sum of \(\frac{95}{57}\) and \(\frac{28}{80}\) is \(\frac{121}{60}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously found that the sum of \(\frac{95}{57}\) and \(\frac{28}{80}\) is \(\frac{121}{60}\).

To find double this sum, we simply multiply \(\frac{121}{60}\) by 2:

\[
2 \times \frac{121}{60} = \frac{2 \times 121}{60} = \frac{242}{60}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{242}{60}\):

1. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 242 and 60. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
   - \(242 \div 60 \approx 4\) remainder 2
   - \(60 \div 2 = 30\) remainder 0

   The GCD is 2.

2. Simplify by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
   \[
   \frac{242 \div 2}{60 \div 2} = \frac{121}{30}
   \]

So, doubling the sum of \(\frac{95}{57}\) and \(\frac{28}{80}\) gives us \(\frac{121}{30}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{95}{21}\) and \(\frac{28}{80}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 80 will be our common denominator.

1. **Find the LCM of 21 and 80:**
   - The prime factorization of 21 is \(3 \times 7\).
   - The prime factorization of 80 is \(2^4 \times 5\).

   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
   - LCM = \(2^4 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 16 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7\).

   Let's calculate this step-by-step:
   - \(16 \times 3 = 48\)
   - \(48 \times 5 = 240\)
   - \(240 \times 7 = 1680\)

   So, the LCM of 21 and 80 is 1680.

2. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 1680:**
   - For \(\frac{95}{21}\):
     \[
     \frac{95}{21} = \frac{95 \times 80}{21 \times 80} = \frac{7600}{1680}
     \]

   - For \(\frac{28}{80}\):
     \[
     \frac{28}{80} = \frac{28 \times 21}{80 \times 21} = \frac{588}{1680}
     \]

3. **Add the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{7600}{1680} + \frac{588}{1680} = \frac{7600 + 588}{1680} = \frac{8188}{1680}
   \]

4. **Simplify the fraction \(\frac{8188}{1680}\):**
   - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8188 and 1680. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
     - \(8188 \div 1680 \approx 4\) remainder 468
     - \(1680 \div 468 \approx 3\) remainder 276
     - \(468 \div 276 \approx 1\) remainder 192
     - \(276 \div 192 \approx 1\) remainder 84
     - \(192 \div 84 \approx 2\) remainder 24
     - \(84 \div 24 \approx 3\) remainder 12
     - \(24 \div 12 = 2\) remainder 0

     The GCD is 12.

   - Simplify by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 12:
     \[
     \frac{8188 \div 12}{1680 \div 12} = \frac{682}{140}
     \]

   - Further simplify \(\frac{682}{140}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 2:
     \[
     \frac{682 \div 2}{140 \div 2} = \frac{341}{70}
     \]

So, the sum of \(\frac{95}{21}\) and \(\frac{28}{80}\) is \(\frac{341}{70}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \(\frac{14}{57}\) and \(\frac{92}{42}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 57 and 42 will serve as the common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 57 and 42:
- 57 = 3 Ã— 19
- 42 = 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 7

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number:
- LCM = 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 7 Ã— 19 = 798

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 798:
\[
\frac{14}{57} = \frac{14 \times 14}{57 \times 14} = \frac{196}{798}
\]
\[
\frac{92}{42} = \frac{92 \times 19}{42 \times 19} = \frac{1748}{798}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{196}{798} + \frac{1748}{798} = \frac{196 + 1748}{798} = \frac{1944}{798}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{1944}{798}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1944 and 798. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
1944 \div 798 \approx 2.436 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 348)}
\]
\[
1944 - 2 \times 798 = 348
\]
\[
798 \div 348 \approx 2.294 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 102)}
\]
\[
798 - 2 \times 348 = 102
\]
\[
348 \div 102 = 3 \quad \text{(quotient 3, remainder 42)}
\]
\[
348 - 3 \times 102 = 42
\]
\[
102 \div 42 \approx 2.428 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 18)}
\]
\[
102 - 2 \times 42 = 18
\]
\[
42 \div 18 \approx 2.333 \quad \text{(quotient 2, remainder 6)}
\]
\[
42 - 2 \times 18 = 6
\]
\[
18 \div 6 = 3 \quad \text{(quotient 3, remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 6. We simplify \(\frac{1944}{798}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 6:
\[
\frac{1944 \div 6}{798 \div 6} = \frac{324}{133}
\]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{14}{57}\) and \(\frac{92}{42}\) is \(\frac{324}{133}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the sum of \(\frac{14}{57}\) and \(\frac{92}{42}\). We already calculated this in the previous problem as \(\frac{324}{133}\).

Next, we need to subtract \(\frac{38}{65}\) from \(\frac{324}{133}\). To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{324}{133}\) and \(\frac{38}{65}\).

The least common multiple (LCM) of 133 and 65 will serve as the common denominator. We find the prime factorizations of 133 and 65:
- 133 = 7 Ã— 19
- 65 = 5 Ã— 13

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number:
- LCM = 5 Ã— 7 Ã— 13 Ã— 19 = 8655

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 8655:
\[
\frac{324}{133} = \frac{324 \times 65}{133 \times 65} = \frac{21060}{8655}
\]
\[
\frac{38}{65} = \frac{38 \times 133}{65 \times 133} = \frac{5054}{8655}
\]

Now, we subtract the two fractions:
\[
\frac{21060}{8655} - \frac{5054}{8655} = \frac{21060 - 5054}{8655} = \frac{16006}{8655}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{16006}{8655}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 16006 and 8655. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
16006 \div 8655 \approx 1.848 \quad \text{(quotient 1, remainder 7351)}

\[
16006 - 1 \times 8655 = 7351

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous problem, you found the result of adding 14/57 and 92/42. Now consider a different scenario where instead of adding 92/42 you add 32/42 to 14/57. What would be the new result?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \(\frac{14}{57}\) and \(\frac{32}{42}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 57 and 42 will serve as the common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 57 and 42:
- 57 = 3 Ã— 19
- 42 = 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 7

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number:
- LCM = 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 7 Ã— 19 = 798

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 798:
\[
\frac{14}{57} = \frac{14 \times 14}{57 \times 14} = \frac{196}{798}
\]
\[
\frac{32}{42} = \frac{32 \times 19}{42 \times 19} = \frac{608}{798}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{196}{798} + \frac{608}{798} = \frac{196 + 608}{798} = \frac{804}{798}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{804}{798}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 804 and 798. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
804 \div 798 \approx 1.0075 \quad \text{(quotient 1, remainder 6)}
\]
\[
804 - 1 \times 798 = 6
\]
\[
798 \div 6 = 133 \quad \text{(quotient 133, remainder 0)}
\]

The GCD is 6. We simplify \(\frac{804}{798}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 6:
\[
\frac{804 \div 6}{798 \div 6} = \frac{134}{133}
\]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{14}{57}\) and \(\frac{32}{42}\) is \(\frac{134}{133}\).

Next, we already have \(\frac{6}{5}\).

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{13}{5} = \frac{13 \times 64}{5 \times 64} = \frac{832}{320}
\]

Next, convert \(\frac{39}{64}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 320:
\[
\frac{39}{64} = \frac{39 \times 5}{64 \times 5} = \frac{195}{320}

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{832}{320} + \frac{195}{320} = \frac{832 + 195}{320} = \frac{1027}{320}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{77}{55} + \frac{6}{79}\right)\), we need to find a common denominator and then add the fractions.

First, identify the common denominator for 55 and 79. Since 55 and 79 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), the common denominator is their product:
\[
55 \times 79 = 4345
\]

Next, convert each fraction to have this common denominator.

For \(\frac{77}{55}\):
\[
\frac{77}{55} = \frac{77 \times 79}{55 \times 79} = \frac{6083}{4345}
\]

For \(\frac{6}{79}\):
\[
\frac{6}{79} = \frac{6 \times 55}{79 \times 55} = \frac{330}{4345}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{6083}{4345} + \frac{330}{4345} = \frac{6083 + 330}{4345} = \frac{6413}{4345}

So, the result of the expression is \(\frac{6413}{4345}\).

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1940:

\[
\frac{23}{20} = \frac{23 \times 97}{20 \times 97} = \frac{2231}{1940}
\]

\[
\frac{82}{97} = \frac{82 \times 20}{97 \times 20} = \frac{1640}{1940}
\]

Now, we can add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{2231}{1940} + \frac{1640}{1940} = \frac{2231 + 1640}{1940} = \frac{3871}{1940}

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 21340:

\[
\frac{3871}{1940} = \frac{3871 \times 11}{1940 \times 11} = \frac{42581}{21340}
\]

\[
\frac{7}{44} = \frac{7 \times 485}{44 \times 485} = \frac{3395}{21340}

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:

\[

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{39186}{21340} \). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 39186 and 21340, which is 2.

\[

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \(\frac{54}{88}\) and \(\frac{28}{10}\), we first need to simplify each fraction if possible.

1. Simplify \(\frac{54}{88}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 54 and 88 is 2.
   - \(\frac{54}{88} = \frac{54 \div 2}{88 \div 2} = \frac{27}{44}\).

2. Simplify \(\frac{28}{10}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 10 is 2.
   - \(\frac{28}{10} = \frac{28 \div 2}{10 \div 2} = \frac{14}{5}\).

Next, we need to find a common denominator to add the fractions \(\frac{27}{44}\) and \(\frac{14}{5}\).

The least common multiple (LCM) of 44 and 5 is 220.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 220:
- \(\frac{27}{44} = \frac{27 \times 5}{44 \times 5} = \frac{135}{220}\).
- \(\frac{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 44}{5 \times 44} = \frac{616}{220}\).

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{135}{220} + \frac{616}{220} = \frac{135 + 616}{220} = \frac{751}{220}.
\]

The fraction \(\frac{751}{220}\) is already in its simplest form because 751 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 220.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously found that the sum of \(\frac{54}{88}\) and \(\frac{28}{10}\) is \(\frac{751}{220}\).

Now, we need to add \(\frac{751}{220}\) to \(\frac{21}{13}\).

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{751}{220}\) and \(\frac{21}{13}\).

The least common multiple (LCM) of 220 and 13 is 2860.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 2860:
- \(\frac{751}{220} = \frac{751 \times 13}{220 \times 13} = \frac{9763}{2860}\).
- \(\frac{21}{13} = \frac{21 \times 220}{13 \times 220} = \frac{4620}{2860}\).

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{9763}{2860} + \frac{4620}{2860} = \frac{9763 + 4620}{2860} = \frac{14383}{2860}.
\]

The fraction \(\frac{14383}{2860}\) is already in its simplest form because 14383 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 2860.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \( \frac{7}{69} + \frac{71}{47} \), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 69 and 47. The least common multiple (LCM) of 69 and 47 is their product, since 69 and 47 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1).

So, the common denominator is \( 69 \times 47 = 3243 \).

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{7}{69} = \frac{7 \times 47}{69 \times 47} = \frac{329}{3243}
\]

\[
\frac{71}{47} = \frac{71 \times 69}{47 \times 69} = \frac{4899}{3243}
\]

Now, we can add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{329}{3243} + \frac{4899}{3243} = \frac{329 + 4899}{3243} = \frac{5228}{3243}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{5228}{3243} \), we check for any common factors. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5228 and 3243 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the result of the operation is:

\[
\frac{5228}{3243}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we have the result of the previous operation:

\[
\frac{7}{69} + \frac{71}{47} = \frac{5228}{3243}
\]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{61}{7}\) to this result. To do this, we need a common denominator for \(\frac{5228}{3243}\) and \(\frac{61}{7}\).

The denominators are 3243 and 7. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3243 and 7 is their product, since 3243 and 7 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1).

So, the common denominator is \( 3243 \times 7 = 22701 \).

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[
\frac{5228}{3243} = \frac{5228 \times 7}{3243 \times 7} = \frac{36696}{22701}
\]

\[
\frac{61}{7} = \frac{61 \times 3243}{7 \times 3243} = \frac{197823}{22701}
\]

Now, we can add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{36696}{22701} + \frac{197823}{22701} = \frac{36696 + 197823}{22701} = \frac{234519}{22701}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{234519}{22701}\), we check for any common factors. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 234519 and 22701 is 3.

Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{234519 \div 3}{22701 \div 3} = \frac{78173}{7567}
\]

Thus, the simplified result of the operation is:

\[

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \( \frac{15}{32} \) and \( \frac{65}{15} \), we first need to find a common denominator. However, since the denominators 32 and 15 do not have a common factor other than 1, the least common denominator (LCD) is their product, which is \( 32 \times 15 = 480 \).

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

1. Convert \( \frac{15}{32} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 480:
   \[
   \frac{15}{32} = \frac{15 \times 15}{32 \times 15} = \frac{225}{480}
   \]

2. Convert \( \frac{65}{15} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 480:
   \[
   \frac{65}{15} = \frac{65 \times 32}{15 \times 32} = \frac{2080}{480}
   \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{225}{480} + \frac{2080}{480} = \frac{225 + 2080}{480} = \frac{2305}{480}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{2305}{480} \), we check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2305 and 480. The GCD is 5.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[
\frac{2305 \div 5}{480 \div 5} = \frac{461}{96}

Thus, the sum of \( \frac{15}{32} \) and \( \frac{65}{15} \) is \( \frac{461}{96} \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \( \frac{87}{26} \) and \( \frac{461}{96} \), we first need to convert both fractions to have a common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) of 26 and 96 can be found by determining the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers.

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- \( 26 = 2 \times 13 \)
- \( 96 = 2^5 \times 3 \)

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
\[
\text{LCM}(26, 96) = 2^5 \times 3 \times 13 = 32 \times 3 \times 13 = 1248
\]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

1. Convert \( \frac{87}{26} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 1248:
   \[
   \frac{87}{26} = \frac{87 \times 48}{26 \times 48} = \frac{4176}{1248}
   \]

2. Convert \( \frac{461}{96} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 1248:
   \[
   \frac{461}{96} = \frac{461 \times 13}{96 \times 13} = \frac{5993}{1248}
   \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{4176}{1248} + \frac{5993}{1248} = \frac{4176 + 5993}{1248} = \frac{10169}{1248}

Thus, the sum of \( \frac{87}{26} \) and \( \frac{461}{96} \) is \( \frac{10169}{1248} \).

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 341:

\[
\frac{76}{11} = \frac{76 \times 31}{11 \times 31} = \frac{2356}{341}

Now, we can add the two fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we already found the sum of \(\frac{4}{31}\) and \(\frac{76}{11}\) to be \(\frac{2400}{341}\).

Next, we need to subtract \(\frac{63}{35}\) from \(\frac{2400}{341}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 341 and 35 is 11935 (since 341 and 35 are relatively prime).

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 11935:

\[
\frac{2400}{341} = \frac{2400 \times 35}{341 \times 35} = \frac{84000}{11935}

\[
\frac{63}{35} = \frac{63 \times 341}{35 \times 341} = \frac{21483}{11935}

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:

Thus, the final result after subtracting \(\frac{63}{35}\) from the sum of \(\frac{4}{31}\) and \(\frac{76}{11}\) is \(\frac{62517}{11935}\).

\[ \frac{328}{60} + \frac{500}{60} = \frac{328 + 500}{60} = \frac{828}{60} \]

Next, we simplify \( \frac{828}{60} \). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 828 and 60, which is 12.

\[ \frac{828 \div 12}{60 \div 12} = \frac{69}{5} \]

Thus, the sum of \( \frac{82}{15} \) and \( \frac{100}{12} \) is \( \frac{69}{5} \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already found that the sum of \( \frac{82}{15} \) and \( \frac{100}{12} \) is \( \frac{69}{5} \).

Now, we need to add \( \frac{46}{83} \) to \( \frac{69}{5} \).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 83 is 415.

First, we convert each fraction to have the denominator of 415:

\[ \frac{69}{5} \]
To convert \( \frac{69}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 415, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 83:
\[ \frac{69 \times 83}{5 \times 83} = \frac{5727}{415} \]

\[ \frac{46}{83} \]
To convert \( \frac{46}{83} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 415, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
\[ \frac{46 \times 5}{83 \times 5} = \frac{230}{415} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{5727}{415} + \frac{230}{415} = \frac{5727 + 230}{415} = \frac{5957}{415} \]

Thus, the sum of \( \frac{69}{5} \) and \( \frac{46}{83} \) is \( \frac{5957}{415} \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \( \frac{61}{15} \) and \( \frac{100}{12} \), we again need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 12 is 60.

First, we convert each fraction to have the denominator of 60:

\[ \frac{61}{15} \]
To convert \( \frac{61}{15} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 4:
\[ \frac{61 \times 4}{15 \times 4} = \frac{244}{60} \]

\[ \frac{100}{12} \]
To convert \( \frac{100}{12} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 60, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
\[ \frac{100 \times 5}{12 \times 5} = \frac{500}{60} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{244}{60} + \frac{500}{60} = \frac{244 + 500}{60} = \frac{744}{60} \]

Next, we simplify \( \frac{744}{60} \). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 744 and 60, which is 12.

\[ \frac{744 \div 12}{60 \div 12} = \frac{62}{5} \]

Thus, the sum of \( \frac{61}{15} \) and \( \frac{100}{12} \) is \( \frac{62}{5} \).

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify each fraction within the expression \(\left(\frac{92}{29}\right) + \left(\frac{41}{33}\right)\).

1. Simplify \(\frac{92}{29}\):
   - 92 divided by 29 equals 3 with a remainder of 5, so \(\frac{92}{29} = 3 + \frac{5}{29}\).

2. Simplify \(\frac{41}{33}\):
   - 41 divided by 33 equals 1 with a remainder of 8, so \(\frac{41}{33} = 1 + \frac{8}{33}\).

Now, we add the simplified fractions:
\[
\left(3 + \frac{5}{29}\right) + \left(1 + \frac{8}{33}\right) = 3 + 1 + \frac{5}{29} + \frac{8}{33} = 4 + \frac{5}{29} + \frac{8}{33}
\]

Next, we need to add the fractions \(\frac{5}{29}\) and \(\frac{8}{33}\). To do this, we find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 29 and 33 is 957.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 957:
\[
\frac{5}{29} = \frac{5 \times 33}{29 \times 33} = \frac{165}{957}
\]
\[
\frac{8}{33} = \frac{8 \times 29}{33 \times 29} = \frac{232}{957}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{165}{957} + \frac{232}{957} = \frac{165 + 232}{957} = \frac{397}{957}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
4 + \frac{397}{957}
\]

Since \(\frac{397}{957}\) cannot be simplified further, the final answer is:
\[
4 + \frac{397}{957}
\]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the result of the expression \(\left(\frac{92}{29}\right) + \left(\frac{41}{33}\right)\), which we found to be \(4 + \frac{397}{957}\).

Now, we need to add this result to \(\frac{55}{26}\).

First, convert \(4 + \frac{397}{957}\) to a single fraction:
\[
4 + \frac{397}{957} = \frac{4 \times 957}{957} + \frac{397}{957} = \frac{3828}{957} + \frac{397}{957} = \frac{3828 + 397}{957} = \frac{4225}{957}
\]

Next, we add \(\frac{4225}{957}\) to \(\frac{55}{26}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 957 and 26 is 24882.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 24882:
\[
\frac{4225}{957} = \frac{4225 \times 26}{957 \times 26} = \frac{109850}{24882}
\]
\[
\frac{55}{26} = \frac{55 \times 957}{26 \times 957} = \frac{52635}{24882}
\]

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{109850}{24882} + \frac{52635}{24882} = \frac{109850 + 52635}{24882} = \frac{162485}{24882}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{162485}{24882}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 162485 and 24882. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the GCD is 1, meaning the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\frac{162485}{24882}

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{57}{29}\) and \(\frac{14}{98}\), we first simplify each fraction if possible.

1. Simplify \(\frac{57}{29}\):
   - Since 57 is exactly twice 29, \(\frac{57}{29} = 2\).

2. Simplify \(\frac{14}{98}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 and 98 is 14.
   - \(\frac{14}{98} = \frac{14 \div 14}{98 \div 14} = \frac{1}{7}\).

Now, we add the simplified fractions:
\[
2 + \frac{1}{7}

To add these, we convert 2 to a fraction with a common denominator of 7:
\[
2 = \frac{14}{7}

1. Simplify \( \frac{70}{25} \):
   \[
   \frac{70}{25} = \frac{70 \div 5}{25 \div 5} = \frac{14}{5}
   \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{83}{28} \):
   \[
   \frac{83}{28} \text{ cannot be simplified further since 83 and 28 have no common factors other than 1.}
   \]

Next, we need to find a common denominator for \( \frac{14}{5} \) and \( \frac{83}{28} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 28 is 140.

3. Convert \( \frac{14}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 140:
   \[
   \frac{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 28}{5 \times 28} = \frac{392}{140}

4. Convert \( \frac{83}{28} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 140:
   \[
   \frac{83}{28} = \frac{83 \times 5}{28 \times 5} = \frac{415}{140}

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{392}{140} + \frac{415}{140} = \frac{392 + 415}{140} = \frac{807}{140}

Finally, simplify \( \frac{807}{140} \) if possible. Since 807 and 140 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

First, we need to express \( \frac{47}{13} \) with a common denominator of 140.

1. Convert \( \frac{47}{13} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 140:
   \[
   \frac{47}{13} = \frac{47 \times 140}{13 \times 140} = \frac{47 \times 140}{1820} = \frac{6580}{1820}
   \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{6580}{1820} \):
   \[
   \frac{6580}{1820} = \frac{47 \times 140}{13 \times 140} = \frac{6580}{1820} = \frac{47}{13}

Next, we need to find a common denominator for \( \frac{807}{140} \) and \( \frac{6580}{1820} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 140 and 1820 is 1820.

3. Convert \( \frac{807}{140} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 1820:
   \[
   \frac{807}{140} = \frac{807 \times 13}{140 \times 13} = \frac{10491}{1820}

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[
\frac{10491}{1820} - \frac{6580}{1820} = \frac{10491 - 6580}{1820} = \frac{3911}{1820}

Finally, simplify \( \frac{3911}{1820} \) if possible. Since 3911 and 1820 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we need to add the number of apples and oranges together. Since they are different units (apples and oranges), we simply add the fractions as they are:

2. Convert \(\frac{20}{23}\):
\[
\frac{20}{23} = \frac{20 \times 73}{23 \times 73} = \frac{1460}{1679}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1150}{1679} + \frac{1460}{1679} = \frac{1150 + 1460}{1679} = \frac{2610}{1679}
\]

Since 2610 and 1679 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction \(\frac{2610}{1679}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the result of adding the fractions \(\frac{50}{73}\) and \(\frac{20}{23}\), which we previously found to be \(\frac{2610}{1679}\).

Now, we need to add \(\frac{83}{35}\) to \(\frac{2610}{1679}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1679 and 35 is 58765.

1. Convert \(\frac{2610}{1679}\) to have the common denominator 58765:
\[
\frac{2610}{1679} = \frac{2610 \times 35}{1679 \times 35} = \frac{91350}{58765}
\]

2. Convert \(\frac{83}{35}\) to have the common denominator 58765:
\[
\frac{83}{35} = \frac{83 \times 1679}{35 \times 1679} = \frac{139357}{58765}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{91350}{58765} + \frac{139357}{58765} = \frac{91350 + 139357}{58765} = \frac{230707}{58765}
\]

Since 230707 and 58765 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction \(\frac{230707}{58765}\) is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions \(\frac{50}{57}\) and \(\frac{20}{23}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 57 and 23 is 1311, since 57 and 23 are both prime numbers.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1311:

1. Convert \(\frac{50}{57}\):
\[
\frac{50}{57} = \frac{50 \times 23}{57 \times 23} = \frac{1150}{1311}

\[
\frac{20}{23} = \frac{20 \times 57}{23 \times 57} = \frac{1140}{1311}

Now, we add the two fractions:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the value of \(\left(\frac{49}{57} + \frac{89}{99}\right)\), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 57 and 99. We can find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers to use as the common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 57 = 3 Ã— 19
- 99 = 3Â² Ã— 11

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- LCM = 3Â² Ã— 11 Ã— 19 = 9 Ã— 11 Ã— 19

Calculating step-by-step:
- 9 Ã— 11 = 99
- 99 Ã— 19 = 1881

So, the LCM of 57 and 99 is 1881.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1881:
- \(\frac{49}{57} = \frac{49 \times 33}{57 \times 33} = \frac{1617}{1881}\)
- \(\frac{89}{99} = \frac{89 \times 19}{99 \times 19} = \frac{1691}{1881}\)

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1617}{1881} + \frac{1691}{1881} = \frac{1617 + 1691}{1881} = \frac{3308}{1881}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\left(\frac{49}{57} + \frac{89}{99}\right)\) is \(\frac{3308}{1881}\).

We already know that the least common multiple (LCM) of 57 and 99 is 1881.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1881:

- \(\frac{89}{99} = \frac{89 \times 19}{99 \times 19} = \frac{1691}{1881}\)

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1947}{1881} + \frac{1691}{1881} = \frac{1947 + 1691}{1881} = \frac{3638}{1881}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \( \frac{94}{35} - \frac{23}{49} \), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 35 and 49. The least common multiple (LCM) of 35 and 49 can be found by their prime factorizations:
- 35 = 5 Ã— 7
- 49 = 7 Ã— 7

The LCM is \( 5 \times 7 \times 7 = 245 \).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 245:
\[ \frac{94}{35} = \frac{94 \times 7}{35 \times 7} = \frac{658}{245} \]
\[ \frac{23}{49} = \frac{23 \times 5}{49 \times 5} = \frac{115}{245} \]

Now, we subtract the fractions:
\[ \frac{658}{245} - \frac{115}{245} = \frac{658 - 115}{245} = \frac{543}{245} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{543}{245} \). We check for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 543 and 245. The prime factorization of 543 is \( 3 \times 181 \), and the prime factorization of 245 is \( 5 \times 7 \times 7 \).

\[ \frac{543}{245} \]

Next, we need to add this to the fraction \( \frac{27}{72} \). To do this, we first simplify \( \frac{27}{72} \):
\[ \frac{27}{72} = \frac{27 \div 9}{72 \div 9} = \frac{3}{8} \]

Now, we need a common denominator for \( \frac{543}{245} \) and \( \frac{3}{8} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 245 and 8 can be found by their prime factorizations:
- 245 = 5 Ã— 7 Ã— 7
- 8 = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2

The LCM is \( 5 \times 7 \times 7 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 1225 \).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1225:
\[ \frac{543}{245} = \frac{543 \times 5}{245 \times 5} = \frac{2715}{1225} \]
\[ \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 153}{8 \times 153} = \frac{459}{1225} \]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[ \frac{2715}{1225} + \frac{459}{1225} = \frac{2715 + 459}{1225} = \frac{3174}{1225} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \(\frac{58}{30}\) and \(\frac{49}{37}\), we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 30 and 37 is their product, 30 * 37 = 1110.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator:

\[
\frac{58}{30} = \frac{58 \times 37}{30 \times 37} = \frac{2146}{1110}
\]

\[
\frac{49}{37} = \frac{49 \times 30}{37 \times 30} = \frac{1470}{1110}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{2146}{1110} + \frac{1470}{1110} = \frac{2146 + 1470}{1110} = \frac{3616}{1110}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{3616}{1110}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3616 and 1110. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \(3616 \div 1110 = 3\) remainder \(286\)
2. \(1110 \div 286 = 3\) remainder \(252\)
3. \(286 \div 252 = 1\) remainder \(34\)
4. \(252 \div 34 = 7\) remainder \(14\)
5. \(34 \div 14 = 2\) remainder \(6\)
6. \(14 \div 6 = 2\) remainder \(2\)
7. \(6 \div 2 = 3\) remainder \(0\)

The GCD is 2. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[
\frac{3616 \div 2}{1110 \div 2} = \frac{1808}{555}
\]

Thus, the simplified fraction is \(\frac{1808}{555}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Given that the sum of \(\frac{58}{30}\) and \(\frac{49}{37}\) is represented by the variable \( t \), we previously calculated:

\[
t = \frac{1808}{555}
\]

To find the value of \( t + t \), we simply double the fraction:

\[
t + t = 2t = 2 \times \frac{1808}{555} = \frac{2 \times 1808}{555} = \frac{3616}{555}
\]

Thus, the value of \( t + t \) is \(\frac{3616}{555}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \(\frac{45}{53}\) and \(\frac{71}{50}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 53 and 50 is 2650.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 2650:

\[
\frac{45}{53} = \frac{45 \times 50}{53 \times 50} = \frac{2250}{2650}
\]

\[
\frac{71}{50} = \frac{71 \times 53}{50 \times 53} = \frac{3763}{2650}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{2250}{2650} + \frac{3763}{2650} = \frac{2250 + 3763}{2650} = \frac{6013}{2650}

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{45}{53}\) and \(\frac{71}{50}\) is \(\frac{6013}{2650}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we already have the sum of \(\frac{45}{53}\) and \(\frac{71}{50}\) as \(\frac{6013}{2650}\).

Next, we need to add \(\frac{8}{100}\) to this sum. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2650 and 100 is 265000.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 265000:

\[
\frac{6013}{2650} = \frac{6013 \times 100}{2650 \times 100} = \frac{601300}{265000}
\]

\[
\frac{8}{100} = \frac{8 \times 2650}{100 \times 2650} = \frac{21200}{265000}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{601300}{265000} + \frac{21200}{265000} = \frac{601300 + 21200}{265000} = \frac{622500}{265000}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 622500 and 265000 is 500.

\[
\frac{622500 \div 500}{265000 \div 500} = \frac{1245}{530}
\]

Thus, the final result after adding \(\frac{45}{53}\), \(\frac{71}{50}\), and \(\frac{8}{100}\) is \(\frac{1245}{530}\).

\[
\frac{36}{72} = \frac{36 \div 36}{72 \div 36} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, we add \( \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \frac{49}{1} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 2 and 1 is 2. We convert \( \frac{49}{1} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 2:
\[
\frac{49}{1} = \frac{49 \times 2}{1 \times 2} = \frac{98}{2}

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{98}{2} = \frac{1 + 98}{2} = \frac{99}{2}

Now, we subtract \( \frac{48}{10} \) from \( \frac{495}{10} \):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{33}{90} + \frac{77}{79}\right)\), we need to find a common denominator. However, since the problem asks for the answer as an unsimplified fraction, we can directly add the fractions by using the product of the denominators as the common denominator.

First, we rewrite the fractions with a common denominator:
\[
\frac{33}{90} + \frac{77}{79} = \frac{33 \cdot 79}{90 \cdot 79} + \frac{77 \cdot 90}{79 \cdot 90}
\]

This gives us:
\[
\frac{33 \cdot 79 + 77 \cdot 90}{90 \cdot 79}
\]

Now, we calculate the numerators:
\[
33 \cdot 79 = 2607
\]
\[
77 \cdot 90 = 6930
\]

Adding these results:
\[
2607 + 6930 = 9537
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{9537}{90 \cdot 79}
\]

Calculating the denominator:
\[
90 \cdot 79 = 7110
\]

So, the final unsimplified fraction is:
\[
\frac{9537}{7110}
\]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already have the result of \(\left(\frac{33}{90} + \frac{77}{79}\right)\) as \(\frac{9537}{7110}\).

Now, we need to subtract \(\frac{7}{89}\) from this result. To do this, we need a common denominator. The common denominator will be the product of the two denominators, \(7110\) and \(89\).

First, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{9537}{7110} - \frac{7}{89} = \frac{9537 \cdot 89}{7110 \cdot 89} - \frac{7 \cdot 7110}{89 \cdot 7110}
\]

This gives us:
\[
\frac{9537 \cdot 89 - 7 \cdot 7110}{7110 \cdot 89}
\]

Now, we calculate the numerators:
\[
9537 \cdot 89 = 849393
\]
\[
7 \cdot 7110 = 49770
\]

Subtracting these results:
\[
849393 - 49770 = 799623
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{799623}{7110 \cdot 89}
\]

Calculating the denominator:
\[
7110 \cdot 89 = 632790
\]

So, the final unsimplified fraction is:
\[
\frac{799623}{632790}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{30}{79}\) and \(\frac{29}{6}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 79 and 6 is 474.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 474:

\[
\frac{30}{79} = \frac{30 \times 6}{79 \times 6} = \frac{180}{474}
\]

\[
\frac{29}{6} = \frac{29 \times 79}{6 \times 79} = \frac{2291}{474}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{180}{474} + \frac{2291}{474} = \frac{180 + 2291}{474} = \frac{2471}{474}

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{30}{79}\) and \(\frac{29}{6}\) is \(\frac{2471}{474}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we have the sum of \(\frac{30}{79}\) and \(\frac{29}{6}\) which is \(\frac{2471}{474}\).

Next, we need to subtract \(\frac{44}{75}\) from \(\frac{2471}{474}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 474 and 75 is 11850.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 11850:

\[
\frac{2471}{474} = \frac{2471 \times 25}{474 \times 25} = \frac{61775}{11850}
\]

\[
\frac{44}{75} = \frac{44 \times 158}{75 \times 158} = \frac{6952}{11850}
\]

Now, we subtract the two fractions:

\[
\frac{61775}{11850} - \frac{6952}{11850} = \frac{61775 - 6952}{11850} = \frac{54823}{11850}

Thus, the result of subtracting \(\frac{44}{75}\) from the sum of \(\frac{30}{79}\) and \(\frac{29}{6}\) is \(\frac{54823}{11850}\).

1. Convert \( \frac{59}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 66:
   \[
   \frac{59}{2} = \frac{59 \times 33}{2 \times 33} = \frac{1947}{66}
   \]

2. Now, we have the fractions \( \frac{1947}{66} \) and \( \frac{11}{66} \).

3. Subtract \( \frac{11}{66} \) from \( \frac{1947}{66} \):
   \[
   \frac{1947}{66} - \frac{11}{66} = \frac{1947 - 11}{66} = \frac{1936}{66}

4. Simplify \( \frac{1936}{66} \) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1936 and 66. The GCD is 2:

1. First, simplify \( \frac{63}{51} \):
   \[
   \frac{63}{51} = \frac{63 \div 3}{51 \div 3} = \frac{21}{17}
   \]

2. Next, we already found the result of subtracting \( \frac{11}{66} \) from \( \frac{59}{2} \) in the previous problem, which is \( \frac{968}{33} \).

3. Now, we need to find the sum of \( \frac{21}{17} \) and \( \frac{968}{33} \). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 17 and 33 is 561.

4. Convert \( \frac{21}{17} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 561:
   \[
   \frac{21}{17} = \frac{21 \times 33}{17 \times 33} = \frac{693}{561}
   \]

5. Convert \( \frac{968}{33} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 561:
   \[
   \frac{968}{33} = \frac{968 \times 17}{33 \times 17} = \frac{16456}{561}

6. Add the two fractions:
   \[

Thus, the sum of \( \frac{63}{51} \) and the result of subtracting \( \frac{11}{66} \) from \( \frac{59}{2} \) is \( \frac{17149}{561} \).

2. Convert \( \frac{11}{31} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 62:

3. Now, we have the fractions \( \frac{1829}{62} \) and \( \frac{22}{62} \).

            We previously calculated the sum of the fractions 58/23 and 25/26. Now, suppose we had started with 45/23 instead of 58/23. How does the sum of 45/23 and 25/26 compare to the original calculation?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the sum of \(\frac{45}{23}\) and \(\frac{25}{26}\) with the original sum of \(\frac{58}{23}\) and \(\frac{25}{26}\), we need to calculate the new sum and then compare it to the original sum.

1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 23 and 26:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(23, 26) = 23 \times 26 = 598
   \]

2. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 598:
   \[
   \frac{45}{23} = \frac{45 \times 26}{23 \times 26} = \frac{1170}{598}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{25}{26} = \frac{25 \times 23}{26 \times 23} = \frac{575}{598}
   \]

3. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{1170}{598} + \frac{575}{598} = \frac{1170 + 575}{598} = \frac{1745}{598}
   \]

Now, let's compare this to the original sum:
   \[
   \frac{58}{23} + \frac{25}{26} = \frac{1508}{598} + \frac{575}{598} = \frac{2083}{598}
   \]

We can see that:
   \[
   \frac{1745}{598} &lt; \frac{2083}{598}
   \]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{45}{23}\) and \(\frac{25}{26}\) is less than the sum of \(\frac{58}{23}\) and \(\frac{25}{26}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \( \frac{70}{13} \) and \( \frac{17}{52} \), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 52 is 52.

Next, we convert \( \frac{70}{13} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 52:
\[ \frac{70}{13} = \frac{70 \times 4}{13 \times 4} = \frac{280}{52} \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{280}{52} + \frac{17}{52} = \frac{280 + 17}{52} = \frac{297}{52} \]

The fraction \( \frac{297}{52} \) is already in its simplest form because 297 and 52 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{70}{13} \) and \( \frac{17}{52} \), which we previously calculated as \( \frac{297}{52} \).

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{35}{87} \) from \( \frac{297}{52} \). To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{297}{52} \) and \( \frac{35}{87} \).

The least common multiple (LCM) of 52 and 87 is 4524.

Convert \( \frac{297}{52} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4524:
\[ \frac{297}{52} = \frac{297 \times 87}{52 \times 87} = \frac{25839}{4524} \]

Convert \( \frac{35}{87} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 4524:
\[ \frac{35}{87} = \frac{35 \times 52}{87 \times 52} = \frac{1820}{4524} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{25839}{4524} - \frac{1820}{4524} = \frac{25839 - 1820}{4524} = \frac{24019}{4524} \]

The fraction \( \frac{24019}{4524} \) is already in its simplest form because 24019 and 4524 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{78}{44}\) and \(\frac{17}{91}\), we first need to find a common denominator. 

1. Simplify the fractions if possible:
   - \(\frac{78}{44}\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:
     \[
     \frac{78 \div 2}{44 \div 2} = \frac{39}{22}
     \]
   - \(\frac{17}{91}\) is already in its simplest form since 17 and 91 have no common factors other than 1.

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 22 and 91:
   - The prime factorization of 22 is \(2 \times 11\).
   - The prime factorization of 91 is \(7 \times 13\).
   - The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
     \[
     LCM = 2 \times 11 \times 7 \times 13 = 2002
     \]

3. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 2002:
   - For \(\frac{39}{22}\):
     \[
     \frac{39}{22} = \frac{39 \times 91}{22 \times 91} = \frac{3549}{2002}
     \]
   - For \(\frac{17}{91}\):
     \[
     \frac{17}{91} = \frac{17 \times 22}{91 \times 22} = \frac{374}{2002}

4. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{3549}{2002} + \frac{374}{2002} = \frac{3549 + 374}{2002} = \frac{3923}{2002}

1. Simplify \(\frac{84}{34}\):
   - The GCD of 84 and 34 is 2.
   - Simplify by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
     \[
     \frac{84 \div 2}{34 \div 2} = \frac{42}{17}
     \]

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 17 and 2002:
   - The prime factorization of 17 is \(17\).
   - The prime factorization of 2002 is \(2 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13\).
   - Since 17 is a prime number and does not share any factors with 2002, the LCM is:
     \[
     LCM = 17 \times 2002 = 34034

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{43}{4}\) and \(\frac{71}{4}\), we need to add the numerators while keeping the denominator the same.

\[
\frac{43}{4} + \frac{71}{4} = \frac{43 + 71}{4}
\]

Next, we add the numerators:

\[
43 + 71 = 114
\]

So, the sum of the fractions is:

\[
\frac{114}{4}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

\[
\frac{114 \div 2}{4 \div 2} = \frac{57}{2}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \(\frac{43}{4}\), \(\frac{71}{4}\), and \(\frac{92}{79}\), we first add the fractions with the same denominator:

\[
\frac{43}{4} + \frac{71}{4} = \frac{43 + 71}{4} = \frac{114}{4}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{114}{4}\):

\[
\frac{114}{4} = \frac{57}{2}
\]

Now, we need to add \(\frac{57}{2}\) and \(\frac{92}{79}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 79 is 158.

Convert \(\frac{57}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 158:

\[
\frac{57}{2} = \frac{57 \times 79}{2 \times 79} = \frac{4503}{158}
\]

Convert \(\frac{92}{79}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 158:

\[
\frac{92}{79} = \frac{92 \times 2}{79 \times 2} = \frac{184}{158}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{4503}{158} + \frac{184}{158} = \frac{4503 + 184}{158} = \frac{4687}{158}

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{43}{4}\), \(\frac{71}{4}\), and \(\frac{92}{79}\) is \(\frac{4687}{158}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions \(\frac{43}{4}\) and \(\frac{71}{89}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 89 is 356, since 89 is a prime number and does not share any factors with 4.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 356:

\[
\frac{43}{4} = \frac{43 \times 89}{4 \times 89} = \frac{3827}{356}
\]

\[
\frac{71}{89} = \frac{71 \times 4}{89 \times 4} = \frac{284}{356}
\]

Now, we can add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{3827}{356} + \frac{284}{356} = \frac{3827 + 284}{356} = \frac{4111}{356}
\]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{43}{4}\) and \(\frac{71}{89}\) is \(\frac{4111}{356}\).

            What is the result of adding the fractions 17/74 and 53/27?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions \( \frac{17}{74} \) and \( \frac{53}{27} \), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 74 and 27 will be our common denominator.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 74 and 27:
- 74 = 2 Ã— 37
- 27 = 3^3

The LCM of 74 and 27 is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved:
- LCM = 2^1 Ã— 3^3 Ã— 37^1 = 2 Ã— 27 Ã— 37

Calculating the LCM:
\[ 2 \times 27 = 54 \]
\[ 54 \times 37 = 1998 \]

So, the common denominator is 1998.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{17}{74} = \frac{17 \times 27}{74 \times 27} = \frac{459}{1998} \]
\[ \frac{53}{27} = \frac{53 \times 74}{27 \times 74} = \frac{3922}{1998} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{459}{1998} + \frac{3922}{1998} = \frac{459 + 3922}{1998} = \frac{4381}{1998} \]

The fraction \( \frac{4381}{1998} \) is already in its simplest form because 4381 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 1998.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract \( \frac{23}{29} \) from \( \frac{4381}{1998} \), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1998 and 29 will be our common denominator.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 1998 and 29:
- 1998 = 2 Ã— 3^3 Ã— 37
- 29 is a prime number

The LCM of 1998 and 29 is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved:
- LCM = 2^1 Ã— 3^3 Ã— 37^1 Ã— 29^1 = 2 Ã— 27 Ã— 37 Ã— 29

Calculating the LCM:
\[ 2 \times 27 = 54 \]
\[ 54 \times 37 = 1998 \]
\[ 1998 \times 29 = 57942 \]

So, the common denominator is 57942.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{4381}{1998} = \frac{4381 \times 29}{1998 \times 29} = \frac{127049}{57942} \]
\[ \frac{23}{29} = \frac{23 \times 1998}{29 \times 1998} = \frac{45954}{57942} \]

Now, we subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{127049}{57942} - \frac{45954}{57942} = \frac{127049 - 45954}{57942} = \frac{81095}{57942} \]

The fraction \( \frac{81095}{57942} \) can be simplified by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 81095 and 57942. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 81095 \div 57942 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 23153 \)
2. \( 57942 \div 23153 \approx 2 \) remainder \( 11636 \)
3. \( 23153 \div 11636 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 11017 \)
4. \( 11636 \div 11017 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 619 \)
5. \( 11017 \div 619 \approx 17 \) remainder \( 508 \)
6. \( 619 \div 508 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 111 \)
7. \( 508 \div 111 \approx 4 \) remainder \( 64 \)
8. \( 111 \div 64 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 47 \)
9. \( 64 \div 47 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 17 \)
10. \( 47 \div 17 \approx 2 \) remainder \( 13 \)
11. \( 17 \div 13 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 4 \)
12. \( 13 \div 4 \approx 3 \) remainder \( 1 \)
13. \( 4 \div 1 = 4 \) remainder \( 0 \)

The GCD is 1, so the fraction \( \frac{81095}{57942} \) is already in its simplest form.

            If initially, instead of having 17/74 of the fruit basket filled with oranges, we had 28/74 of it filled with oranges, and we still added the same 53/27 fraction of the basket filled with apples, then what would the total fraction of the fruit basket be when filled with these fruits?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total fraction of the fruit basket filled with oranges and apples, we need to add the fractions \( \frac{28}{74} \) and \( \frac{53}{27} \).

First, we need to find a common denominator. As before, the least common multiple (LCM) of 74 and 27 is 1998.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{28}{74} = \frac{28 \times 27}{74 \times 27} = \frac{756}{1998} \]
\[ \frac{53}{27} = \frac{53 \times 74}{27 \times 74} = \frac{3922}{1998} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{756}{1998} + \frac{3922}{1998} = \frac{756 + 3922}{1998} = \frac{4678}{1998} \]

To simplify \( \frac{4678}{1998} \), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4678 and 1998. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 4678 \div 1998 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 682.
2. \( 1998 \div 682 \) gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 634.
3. \( 682 \div 634 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 48.
4. \( 634 \div 48 \) gives a quotient of 13 and a remainder of 10.
5. \( 48 \div 10 \) gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 8.
6. \( 10 \div 8 \) gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 2.
7. \( 8 \div 2 \) gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 0.

The GCD is 2.

Now, we simplify \( \frac{4678}{1998} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{4678 \div 2}{1998 \div 2} = \frac{2339}{999} \]

1. Simplify \(76/76\):
\[

\[
96/33 = \frac{96}{33}
\]

Now, add the simplified values together:
\[

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is 33. So, we convert 1 to a fraction with a denominator of 33:

Now, add the fractions:
\[

Next, we need to subtract these two fractions:

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 9 is 63.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 63:
\[
\frac{47}{7} = \frac{47 \times 9}{7 \times 9} = \frac{423}{63}

\[
\frac{5}{9} = \frac{5 \times 7}{9 \times 7} = \frac{35}{63}

Now, subtract the fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{60}{79} \) and \( \frac{53}{38} \), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 79 and 38 will serve as the common denominator.

1. **Find the LCM of 79 and 38:**
   - 79 is a prime number.
   - 38 can be factored into \( 2 \times 19 \).

Since 79 and 38 have no common factors other than 1, their LCM is simply \( 79 \times 38 \).

2. **Calculate the LCM:**
   \[
   79 \times 38 = 3002
   \]

3. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 3002:**
   - For \( \frac{60}{79} \):
     \[
     \frac{60}{79} = \frac{60 \times 38}{79 \times 38} = \frac{2280}{3002}
     \]
   - For \( \frac{53}{38} \):
     \[
     \frac{53}{38} = \frac{53 \times 79}{38 \times 79} = \frac{4187}{3002}
     \]

4. **Add the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{2280}{3002} + \frac{4187}{3002} = \frac{2280 + 4187}{3002} = \frac{6467}{3002}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new total, we need to add \( \frac{5}{11} \) to the previous result of \( \frac{6467}{3002} \).

1. **Find a common denominator for \( \frac{6467}{3002} \) and \( \frac{5}{11} \):**
   - The denominators are 3002 and 11.
   - The least common multiple (LCM) of 3002 and 11 is \( 3002 \times 11 \) since 11 is a prime number and does not divide 3002.

2. **Calculate the LCM:**
   \[

3. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 33022:**
   - For \( \frac{6467}{3002} \):
     \[
     \frac{6467}{3002} = \frac{6467 \times 11}{3002 \times 11} = \frac{71137}{33022}

   - For \( \frac{5}{11} \):
     \[
     \frac{5}{11} = \frac{5 \times 3002}{11 \times 3002} = \frac{15010}{33022}

4. **Add the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{71137}{33022} + \frac{15010}{33022} = \frac{71137 + 15010}{33022} = \frac{86147}{33022}

Thus, the new total when you add \( \frac{5}{11} \) to the previous result of \( \frac{6467}{3002} \) is \( \frac{86147}{33022} \).

Now, we need to add 1 to \( \frac{53}{38} \). To do this, we convert 1 to a fraction with the same denominator as \( \frac{53}{38} \):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the fraction equation \( \frac{39}{48} + \frac{19}{84} \), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

First, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 48 and 84.

The prime factorization of 48 is:
\[ 48 = 2^4 \times 3 \]

The prime factorization of 84 is:
\[ 84 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7 \]

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^4 \times 3 \times 7 = 16 \times 3 \times 7 = 336 \]

So, the common denominator is 336.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 336.

For \( \frac{39}{48} \):
\[ \frac{39}{48} = \frac{39 \times 7}{48 \times 7} = \frac{273}{336} \]

For \( \frac{19}{84} \):
\[ \frac{19}{84} = \frac{19 \times 4}{84 \times 4} = \frac{76}{336} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{273}{336} + \frac{76}{336} = \frac{273 + 76}{336} = \frac{349}{336} \]

The fraction \( \frac{349}{336} \) is an improper fraction. We can convert it to a mixed number:
\[ \frac{349}{336} = 1 \frac{13}{336} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \( \frac{16}{86} \) and \( \frac{60}{3} \), we first simplify each fraction.

1. Simplify \( \frac{16}{86} \):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 16 and 86 is 2.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
     \[
     \frac{16 \div 2}{86 \div 2} = \frac{8}{43}
     \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{60}{3} \):
   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:
     \[
     \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]

Now, we add the simplified fractions:
\[
\frac{8}{43} + 20
\]

To add these, we need a common denominator. Since 20 is an integer, we can write it as a fraction with a denominator of 1:
\[
\frac{8}{43} + \frac{20 \cdot 43}{1 \cdot 43} = \frac{8}{43} + \frac{860}{43}
\]

Now, add the numerators:
\[
\frac{8 + 860}{43} = \frac{868}{43}
\]

Finally, simplify \( \frac{868}{43} \):
\[

   - Divide the numerator by the denominator:

Now, we need to add \( \frac{75}{86} \) and 20. To do this, we write 20 as a fraction with a denominator of 1:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \( \frac{95}{16} - \frac{43}{60} \), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

1. **Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 60:**
   - The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
   - The prime factorization of 60 is \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \).
   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor:
     \[
     \text{LCM} = 2^4 \times 3 \times 5 = 16 \times 3 \times 5 = 240
     \]

2. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 240:**
   - For \( \frac{95}{16} \):
     \[
     \frac{95}{16} = \frac{95 \times 15}{16 \times 15} = \frac{1425}{240}
     \]
   - For \( \frac{43}{60} \):
     \[
     \frac{43}{60} = \frac{43 \times 4}{60 \times 4} = \frac{172}{240}
     \]

3. **Subtract the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{1425}{240} - \frac{172}{240} = \frac{1425 - 172}{240} = \frac{1253}{240}
   \]

4. **Simplify the fraction if possible:**
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1253 and 240 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously found that \( \frac{95}{16} - \frac{43}{60} = \frac{1253}{240} \).

Now, we need to add \( \frac{1253}{240} \) to \( \frac{80}{79} \).

1. **Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 240 and 79:**
   - Since 79 is a prime number, the LCM of 240 and 79 is \( 240 \times 79 = 18960 \).

2. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 18960:**
   - For \( \frac{1253}{240} \):
     \[
     \frac{1253}{240} = \frac{1253 \times 79}{240 \times 79} = \frac{99087}{18960}

   - For \( \frac{80}{79} \):
     \[
     \frac{80}{79} = \frac{80 \times 240}{79 \times 240} = \frac{19200}{18960}
     \]

3. **Add the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{99087}{18960} + \frac{19200}{18960} = \frac{99087 + 19200}{18960} = \frac{118287}{18960}
   \]

4. **Simplify the fraction if possible:**
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 118287 and 18960 is 3.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
     \[
     \frac{118287 \div 3}{18960 \div 3} = \frac{39429}{6320}

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{38}{8} \) and \( \frac{4}{16} \), we first need to have a common denominator.

1. Simplify the fractions if possible:
   - \( \frac{38}{8} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
     \[
     \frac{38 \div 2}{8 \div 2} = \frac{19}{4}
     \]
   - \( \frac{4}{16} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
     \[
     \frac{4 \div 4}{16 \div 4} = \frac{1}{4}
     \]

2. Now, add the simplified fractions:
   - Both fractions now have the same denominator (4), so we can directly add the numerators:
     \[
     \frac{19}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{19 + 1}{4} = \frac{20}{4}
     \]

3. Simplify the resulting fraction:
   - \( \frac{20}{4} \) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

Now, we need to add \( \frac{32}{64} \) to this sum.

1. Simplify \( \frac{32}{64} \):
   - The greatest common divisor of 32 and 64 is 32.
   - Simplify by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 32:
     \[
     \frac{32 \div 32}{64 \div 32} = \frac{1}{2}

2. Add \( \frac{1}{2} \) to the previous sum of 5:

1. Simplify the fractions if possible:

2. Find a common denominator for the fractions \( \frac{3}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{4} \):

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Calculate the sum of 38/59 and 80/94.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \(\frac{38}{59}\) and \(\frac{80}{94}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 59 and 94 will serve as the common denominator.

First, let's factorize the denominators:
- 59 is a prime number.
- 94 can be factored into \(2 \times 47\).

Since 59 and 47 are both prime and do not share any common factors, the LCM of 59 and 94 is simply \(59 \times 94\).

Now, let's convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{38}{59} = \frac{38 \times 94}{59 \times 94} = \frac{3572}{5546}
\]
\[
\frac{80}{94} = \frac{80 \times 59}{94 \times 59} = \frac{4720}{5546}
\]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{3572}{5546} + \frac{4720}{5546} = \frac{3572 + 4720}{5546} = \frac{8292}{5546}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{8292}{5546}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8292 and 5546. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
8292 \div 5546 \approx 1.495 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
8292 - 5546 = 2746
\]
\[
5546 \div 2746 \approx 2.02 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
5546 - 2 \times 2746 = 54
\]
\[
2746 \div 54 \approx 50.85 \quad \text{(integer part is 50)}
\]
\[
2746 - 50 \times 54 = 46
\]
\[
54 \div 46 \approx 1.17 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
54 - 46 = 8
\]
\[
46 \div 8 \approx 5.75 \quad \text{(integer part is 5)}
\]
\[
46 - 5 \times 8 = 6
\]
\[
8 \div 6 \approx 1.33 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
8 - 6 = 2
\]
\[
6 \div 2 = 3
\]
\[
6 - 3 \times 2 = 0
\]

The GCD is 2. Therefore, we simplify \(\frac{8292}{5546}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{8292 \div 2}{5546 \div 2} = \frac{4146}{2773}
\]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the resultant value when adding \(\frac{84}{30}\) to the sum of \(\frac{38}{59}\) and \(\frac{80}{94}\), we first need to calculate the sum of \(\frac{38}{59}\) and \(\frac{80}{94}\) as we did previously.

From the previous calculation, we found:
\[
\frac{38}{59} + \frac{80}{94} = \frac{4146}{2773}
\]

Next, we need to add \(\frac{84}{30}\) to this result. First, let's simplify \(\frac{84}{30}\):
\[
\frac{84}{30} = \frac{84 \div 6}{30 \div 6} = \frac{14}{5}
\]

Now, we need a common denominator to add \(\frac{4146}{2773}\) and \(\frac{14}{5}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 2773 and 5 is \(2773 \times 5 = 13865\).

Convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{4146}{2773} = \frac{4146 \times 5}{2773 \times 5} = \frac{20730}{13865}
\]
\[
\frac{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 2773}{5 \times 2773} = \frac{38822}{13865}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{20730}{13865} + \frac{38822}{13865} = \frac{20730 + 38822}{13865} = \frac{59552}{13865}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{59552}{13865}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 59552 and 13865. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
59552 \div 13865 \approx 4.29 \quad \text{(integer part is 4)}
\]
\[
59552 - 4 \times 13865 = 4062
\]
\[
13865 \div 4062 \approx 3.41 \quad \text{(integer part is 3)}
\]
\[
13865 - 3 \times 4062 = 1679
\]
\[
4062 \div 1679 \approx 2.42 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
4062 - 2 \times 1679 = 704
\]
\[
1679 \div 704 \approx 2.38 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
1679 - 2 \times 704 = 271
\]
\[
704 \div 271 \approx 2.60 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
704 - 2 \times 271 = 162
\]
\[
271 \div 162 \approx 1.67 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
271 - 1 \times 162 = 109
\]
\[
162 \div 109 \approx 1.49 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
162 - 1 \times 109 = 53
\]
\[
109 \div 53 \approx 2.06 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
109 - 2 \times 53 = 3
\]
\[

\[
53 - 17 \times 3 = 2

\[
3 - 1 \times 2 = 1

\[

\[
2 - 2 \times 1 = 0

The GCD is 1. Therefore, \(\frac{59552}{13865}\) is already in its simplest form.

- 39 can be factored into \(3 \times 13\).
- 94 can be factored into \(2 \times 47\).

Since 39 and 94 do not share any common factors, the LCM of 39 and 94 is \(39 \times 94\).

Now, let's convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{38}{39} = \frac{38 \times 94}{39 \times 94} = \frac{3572}{3666}
\]
\[
\frac{80}{94} = \frac{80 \times 39}{94 \times 39} = \frac{3120}{3666}
\]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{3572}{3666} + \frac{3120}{3666} = \frac{3572 + 3120}{3666} = \frac{6692}{3666}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{6692}{3666}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6692 and 3666. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
\[
6692 \div 3666 \approx 1.825 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
6692 - 3666 = 3026
\]
\[
3666 \div 3026 \approx 1.211 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
3666 - 3026 = 640
\]
\[
3026 \div 640 \approx 4.728 \quad \text{(integer part is 4)}

\[

\[

\]
\[
640 - 466 = 174
\]
\[
466 \div 174 \approx 2.678 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
466 - 2 \times 174 = 118
\]
\[
174 \div 118 \approx 1.475 \quad \text{(integer part is 1)}
\]
\[
174 - 118 = 56
\]
\[
118 \div 56 \approx 2.107 \quad \text{(integer part is 2)}
\]
\[
118 - 2 \times 56 = 6
\]
\[
56 \div 6 \approx 9.333 \quad \text{(integer part is 9)}

\[
56 - 9 \times 6 = 2
\]
\[
6 \div 2 = 3

\[

The GCD is 2. Therefore, we simplify \(\frac{6692}{3666}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract the fractions \( \frac{19}{44} \) from \( \frac{33}{5} \), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 44 and 5 is 220.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 220:

1. Convert \( \frac{33}{5} \):
\[
\frac{33}{5} = \frac{33 \times 44}{5 \times 44} = \frac{1452}{220}
\]

2. Convert \( \frac{19}{44} \):
\[
\frac{19}{44} = \frac{19 \times 5}{44 \times 5} = \frac{95}{220}

Now, we subtract the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1452}{220} - \frac{95}{220} = \frac{1452 - 95}{220} = \frac{1357}{220}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to add \( \frac{32}{76} \) to the previous result \( \frac{1357}{220} \). To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions.

1. Simplify \( \frac{32}{76} \):
\[
\frac{32}{76} = \frac{8}{19}
\]

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 220 and 19. Since 19 is a prime number and does not divide 220, the LCM is \( 220 \times 19 = 4180 \).

3. Convert both fractions to have the common denominator of 4180:

\[
\frac{1357}{220} = \frac{1357 \times 19}{220 \times 19} = \frac{25783}{4180}
\]

\[
\frac{8}{19} = \frac{8 \times 220}{19 \times 220} = \frac{1760}{4180}

4. Add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{25783}{4180} + \frac{1760}{4180} = \frac{25783 + 1760}{4180} = \frac{27543}{4180}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to perform the division operations separately.

1. Calculate \( \frac{78}{35} \):

2. Calculate \( \frac{30}{60} \):
\[ \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \]

Next, we add the results of these two divisions:

            What is the sum of 49/75 and 88/58?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{49}{75}\) and \(\frac{88}{58}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 75 and 58 will serve as the common denominator.

1. **Find the LCM of 75 and 58:**
   - The prime factorization of 75 is \(3 \times 5^2\).
   - The prime factorization of 58 is \(2 \times 29\).

   The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(75, 58) = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \times 29 = 2 \times 3 \times 25 \times 29 = 4350
   \]

2. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 4350:**
   - For \(\frac{49}{75}\):
     \[
     \frac{49}{75} = \frac{49 \times 58}{75 \times 58} = \frac{2842}{4350}
     \]

   - For \(\frac{88}{58}\):
     \[
     \frac{88}{58} = \frac{88 \times 75}{58 \times 75} = \frac{6600}{4350}
     \]

3. **Add the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{2842}{4350} + \frac{6600}{4350} = \frac{2842 + 6600}{4350} = \frac{9442}{4350}
   \]

4. **Simplify the resulting fraction:**
   - To simplify \(\frac{9442}{4350}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9442 and 4350.
   - Using the Euclidean algorithm:
     \[
     \text{GCD}(9442, 4350) = 2
     \]

   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
     \[
     \frac{9442 \div 2}{4350 \div 2} = \frac{4721}{2175}
     \]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{49}{75}\) and \(\frac{88}{58}\) is \(\frac{4721}{2175}\).

            Following the previous problem, suppose we now also add 3/82 to the sum of 49/75 and 88/58, what would the new sum be?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new sum of \(\frac{49}{75}\), \(\frac{88}{58}\), and \(\frac{3}{82}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the common denominator for all three fractions:**
   - We already have the least common multiple (LCM) of 75 and 58, which is 4350.
   - Now, we need to find the LCM of 4350 and 82.
   - The prime factorization of 82 is \(2 \times 41\).

   The LCM of 4350 and 82 is:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(4350, 82) = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \times 29 \times 41 = 178350
   \]

2. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 178350:**
   - For \(\frac{49}{75}\):
     \[
     \frac{49}{75} = \frac{49 \times 2378}{75 \times 2378} = \frac{116522}{178350}
     \]

   - For \(\frac{88}{58}\):
     \[
     \frac{88}{58} = \frac{88 \times 3075}{58 \times 3075} = \frac{270600}{178350}
     \]

   - For \(\frac{3}{82}\):
     \[
     \frac{3}{82} = \frac{3 \times 2175}{82 \times 2175} = \frac{6525}{178350}
     \]

3. **Add the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{116522}{178350} + \frac{270600}{178350} + \frac{6525}{178350} = \frac{116522 + 270600 + 6525}{178350} = \frac{393647}{178350}
   \]

4. **Simplify the resulting fraction:**
   - To simplify \(\frac{393647}{178350}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 393647 and 178350.
   - Using the Euclidean algorithm:
     \[
     \text{GCD}(393647, 178350) = 1
     \]

   Since the GCD is 1, the fraction \(\frac{393647}{178350}\) is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the new sum of \(\frac{49}{75}\), \(\frac{88}{58}\), and \(\frac{3}{82}\) is \(\frac{393647}{178350}\).

2. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 4350:**
   - For \(\frac{12}{75}\):
     \[
     \frac{12}{75} = \frac{12 \times 58}{75 \times 58} = \frac{696}{4350}

4. **Simplify the resulting fraction:**
   - To simplify \(\frac{7296}{4350}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7296 and 4350.
   - Using the Euclidean algorithm:
     \[
     \text{GCD}(7296, 4350) = 6
     \]

   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
     \[
     \frac{7296 \div 6}{4350 \div 6} = \frac{1216}{725}
     \]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{12}{75}\) and \(\frac{88}{58}\) is \(\frac{1216}{725}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{77}{30} + \frac{18}{51}\right)\), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

First, let's simplify \(\frac{18}{51}\):
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 51 is 3.
- So, \(\frac{18}{51} = \frac{18 \div 3}{51 \div 3} = \frac{6}{17}\).

Now, we have the expression \(\left(\frac{77}{30} + \frac{6}{17}\right)\).

Next, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 30 and 17:
- Since 17 is a prime number and does not divide 30, the LCM of 30 and 17 is \(30 \times 17 = 510\).

Now, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 510:
- \(\frac{77}{30} = \frac{77 \times 17}{30 \times 17} = \frac{1309}{510}\).
- \(\frac{6}{17} = \frac{6 \times 30}{17 \times 30} = \frac{180}{510}\).

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1309}{510} + \frac{180}{510} = \frac{1309 + 180}{510} = \frac{1489}{510}.
\]

The fraction \(\frac{1489}{510}\) is already in its simplest form because 1489 and 510 have no common factors other than 1.

Now, we need to add this result to itself:

\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{2978}{510}\):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \(\left(\frac{77}{30} + \frac{18}{74}\right)\), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

First, let's simplify \(\frac{18}{74}\):
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 74 is 2.
- So, \(\frac{18}{74} = \frac{18 \div 2}{74 \div 2} = \frac{9}{37}\).

Now, we have the expression \(\left(\frac{77}{30} + \frac{9}{37}\right)\).

Next, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 30 and 37:
- Since 37 is a prime number and does not divide 30, the LCM of 30 and 37 is \(30 \times 37 = 1110\).

Now, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1110:
- \(\frac{77}{30} = \frac{77 \times 37}{30 \times 37} = \frac{2849}{1110}\).
- \(\frac{9}{37} = \frac{9 \times 30}{37 \times 30} = \frac{270}{1110}\).

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[
\frac{2849}{1110} + \frac{270}{1110} = \frac{2849 + 270}{1110} = \frac{3119}{1110}.
\]

The fraction \(\frac{3119}{1110}\) is already in its simplest form because 3119 and 1110 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve \(\frac{57}{22} - \frac{72}{48}\), we first simplify each fraction individually.

1. Simplify \(\frac{72}{48}\):
   \[
   \frac{72}{48} = \frac{72 \div 24}{48 \div 24} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

Now, we have:
\[
\frac{57}{22} - \frac{3}{2}

2. To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 22 and 2 is 22.

3. Convert \(\frac{3}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 22:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3 \times 11}{2 \times 11} = \frac{33}{22}

4. Now, we can subtract the fractions:
   \[

1. The fractions \(\frac{57}{22}\) and \(\frac{72}{100}\) are already in their simplest forms.

2. To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 22 and 100 is 1100.

3. Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 1100:

4. Now, we can subtract the fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the summation of \( \frac{83}{40} + \frac{6}{8} \), we first need to find a common denominator.

1. Simplify \( \frac{6}{8} \):
\[ \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \]

2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 40 and 4. The LCM of 40 and 4 is 40.

3. Convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:
\[ \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3 \times 10}{4 \times 10} = \frac{30}{40} \]

4. Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{83}{40} + \frac{30}{40} = \frac{83 + 30}{40} = \frac{113}{40} \]

So, the summation is:

\[ \frac{83}{40} + \frac{6}{8} = \frac{113}{40} \]

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{24}{64} \) from \( \frac{113}{40} \).

1. Simplify \( \frac{24}{64} \):
\[ \frac{24}{64} = \frac{3}{8} \]

2. Find a common denominator for \( \frac{113}{40} \) and \( \frac{3}{8} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 40 and 8 is 40.

3. Convert \( \frac{3}{8} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions \(\frac{37}{69}\) and \(\frac{67}{61}\), we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 69 and 61 is their least common multiple (LCM).

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 69 and 61:
- 69 = 3 Ã— 23
- 61 is a prime number.

Since 61 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 69, the LCM of 69 and 61 is simply their product:
\[ \text{LCM}(69, 61) = 69 \times 61 = 4209 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{37}{69} = \frac{37 \times 61}{69 \times 61} = \frac{2257}{4209} \]
\[ \frac{67}{61} = \frac{67 \times 69}{61 \times 69} = \frac{4623}{4209} \]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{2257}{4209} + \frac{4623}{4209} = \frac{2257 + 4623}{4209} = \frac{6880}{4209} \]

The fraction \(\frac{6880}{4209}\) can be simplified if there are common factors between the numerator and the denominator. Let's check for common factors:
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6880 and 4209 is 1 (since they have no common prime factors).

Thus, the fraction \(\frac{6880}{4209}\) is already in its simplest form.

First, let's find the LCM:
\[ \text{LCM}(4209, 7) = 4209 \times 7 = 29463 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[ \frac{6880}{4209} = \frac{6880 \times 7}{4209 \times 7} = \frac{48160}{29463} \]
\[ \frac{100}{7} = \frac{100 \times 4209}{7 \times 4209} = \frac{420900}{29463} \]

Now, we can add the fractions:
\[ \frac{48160}{29463} + \frac{420900}{29463} = \frac{48160 + 420900}{29463} = \frac{469060}{29463} \]

The fraction \(\frac{469060}{29463}\) can be simplified if there are common factors between the numerator and the denominator. Let's check for common factors:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{89}{84}\) and \(\frac{75}{34}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 84 and 34 will be our common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 84 and 34:
- 84 = 2^2 * 3 * 7
- 34 = 2 * 17

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 7 * 17 = 4 * 3 * 7 * 17 = 1428

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1428:
- For \(\frac{89}{84}\):
  \[
  \frac{89}{84} = \frac{89 \times 17}{84 \times 17} = \frac{1513}{1428}
  \]

- For \(\frac{75}{34}\):
  \[
  \frac{75}{34} = \frac{75 \times 42}{34 \times 42} = \frac{3150}{1428}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1513}{1428} + \frac{3150}{1428} = \frac{1513 + 3150}{1428} = \frac{4663}{1428}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{4663}{1428}\) is already in its simplest form because 4663 and 1428 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of adding the fraction \(\frac{4663}{1428}\) to itself, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\frac{4663}{1428} + \frac{4663}{1428} = \frac{4663 + 4663}{1428} = \frac{9326}{1428}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{9326}{1428}\). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9326 and 1428 to simplify the fraction.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
1. \(9326 \div 1428 \approx 6.53\) (integer part is 6)
2. \(9326 - 6 \times 1428 = 9326 - 8568 = 758\)
3. \(1428 \div 758 \approx 1.88\) (integer part is 1)
4. \(1428 - 1 \times 758 = 1428 - 758 = 670\)
5. \(758 \div 670 \approx 1.13\) (integer part is 1)
6. \(758 - 1 \times 670 = 758 - 670 = 88\)
7. \(670 \div 88 \approx 7.61\) (integer part is 7)
8. \(670 - 7 \times 88 = 670 - 616 = 54\)
9. \(88 \div 54 \approx 1.63\) (integer part is 1)
10. \(88 - 1 \times 54 = 88 - 54 = 34\)
11. \(54 \div 34 \approx 1.59\) (integer part is 1)
12. \(54 - 1 \times 34 = 54 - 34 = 20\)
13. \(34 \div 20 \approx 1.7\) (integer part is 1)
14. \(34 - 1 \times 20 = 34 - 20 = 14\)
15. \(20 \div 14 \approx 1.43\) (integer part is 1)
16. \(20 - 1 \times 14 = 20 - 14 = 6\)
17. \(14 \div 6 \approx 2.33\) (integer part is 2)
18. \(14 - 2 \times 6 = 14 - 12 = 2\)
19. \(6 \div 2 = 3\) (integer part is 3)
20. \(6 - 3 \times 2 = 6 - 6 = 0\)

The GCD of 9326 and 1428 is 2. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[
\frac{9326}{1428} = \frac{9326 \div 2}{1428 \div 2} = \frac{4663}{714}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new total amount of milk needed, we need to add the fractions \(\frac{94}{84}\) and \(\frac{75}{34}\). As before, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 84 and 34 is 1428.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1428:
- For \(\frac{94}{84}\):
  \[
  \frac{94}{84} = \frac{94 \times 17}{84 \times 17} = \frac{1598}{1428}
  \]

- For \(\frac{75}{34}\):
  \[
  \frac{75}{34} = \frac{75 \times 42}{34 \times 42} = \frac{3150}{1428}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1598}{1428} + \frac{3150}{1428} = \frac{1598 + 3150}{1428} = \frac{4748}{1428}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{4748}{1428}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4748 and 1428. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
- 4748 Ã· 1428 = 3 remainder 464
- 1428 Ã· 464 = 3 remainder 36
- 464 Ã· 36 = 12 remainder 28
- 36 Ã· 28 = 1 remainder 8
- 28 Ã· 8 = 3 remainder 4
- 8 Ã· 4 = 2 remainder 0

The GCD is 4. Therefore, we simplify \(\frac{4748}{1428}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4:
\[
\frac{4748 Ã· 4}{1428 Ã· 4} = \frac{1187}{357}

First, let's check if 78 and 83 have any common factors other than 1. Since 83 is a prime number, it does not share any factors with 78 other than 1. Therefore, the LCM of 78 and 83 is simply their product:

\[ 78 \times 83 = 6474 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{51}{78} = \frac{51 \times 83}{78 \times 83} = \frac{4233}{6474} \]
\[ \frac{44}{83} = \frac{44 \times 78}{83 \times 78} = \frac{3432}{6474} \]

Now, we can add the fractions:

\[ \frac{4233}{6474} + \frac{3432}{6474} = \frac{4233 + 3432}{6474} = \frac{7665}{6474} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{7665}{6474}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7665 and 6474. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 7665 \div 6474 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 1191 \)
2. \( 6474 \div 1191 \approx 5 \) remainder \( 279 \)
3. \( 1191 \div 279 \approx 4 \) remainder \( 75 \)
4. \( 279 \div 75 \approx 3 \) remainder \( 54 \)
5. \( 75 \div 54 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 21 \)
6. \( 54 \div 21 \approx 2 \) remainder \( 12 \)
7. \( 21 \div 12 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 9 \)
8. \( 12 \div 9 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 3 \)
9. \( 9 \div 3 \approx 3 \) remainder \( 0 \)

The GCD is 3. Therefore, we simplify \(\frac{7665}{6474}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[ \frac{7665 \div 3}{6474 \div 3} = \frac{2555}{2158} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously found that the sum of \(\frac{51}{78}\) and \(\frac{44}{83}\) is \(\frac{2555}{2158}\). Now, we need to add this result to \(\frac{71}{92}\).

First, we need to find a common denominator for \(\frac{2555}{2158}\) and \(\frac{71}{92}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 2158 and 92 will be our common denominator.

To find the LCM, we first find the prime factorizations of 2158 and 92:

- 2158: \( 2158 = 2 \times 1079 \) (1079 is a prime number)
- 92: \( 92 = 2^2 \times 23 \)

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in the factorizations:

\[ \text{LCM}(2158, 92) = 2^2 \times 23 \times 1079 = 4 \times 23 \times 1079 = 99148 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{2555}{2158} = \frac{2555 \times 46}{2158 \times 46} = \frac{117530}{99148} \]
\[ \frac{71}{92} = \frac{71 \times 1079}{92 \times 1079} = \frac{76509}{99148} \]

Now, we can add the fractions:

\[ \frac{117530}{99148} + \frac{76509}{99148} = \frac{117530 + 76509}{99148} = \frac{194039}{99148} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{194039}{99148}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 194039 and 99148. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 194039 \div 99148 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 94991 \)
2. \( 99148 \div 94991 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 4157 \)
3. \( 94991 \div 4157 \approx 22 \) remainder \( 4157 \)
4. \( 4157 \div 4157 = 1 \) remainder \( 0 \)

The GCD is 1, meaning the fraction \(\frac{194039}{99148}\) is already in its simplest form.

First, let's check if 74 and 83 have any common factors other than 1. Since 83 is a prime number, it does not share any factors with 74 other than 1. Therefore, the LCM of 74 and 83 is simply their product:

\[ 74 \times 83 = 6142 \]

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

\[ \frac{51}{74} = \frac{51 \times 83}{74 \times 83} = \frac{4233}{6142} \]
\[ \frac{44}{83} = \frac{44 \times 74}{83 \times 74} = \frac{3256}{6142} \]

Now, we can add the fractions:

\[ \frac{4233}{6142} + \frac{3256}{6142} = \frac{4233 + 3256}{6142} = \frac{7489}{6142} \]

Finally, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{7489}{6142}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7489 and 6142. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 7489 \div 6142 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 1347 \)
2. \( 6142 \div 1347 \approx 4 \) remainder \( 754 \)
3. \( 1347 \div 754 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 593 \)
4. \( 754 \div 593 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 161 \)
5. \( 593 \div 161 \approx 3 \) remainder \( 110 \)
6. \( 161 \div 110 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 51 \)
7. \( 110 \div 51 \approx 2 \) remainder \( 8 \)
8. \( 51 \div 8 \approx 6 \) remainder \( 3 \)
9. \( 8 \div 3 \approx 2 \) remainder \( 2 \)
10. \( 3 \div 2 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 1 \)
11. \( 2 \div 1 \approx 2 \) remainder \( 0 \)

The GCD is 1. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{7489}{6142}\) is already in its simplest form.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 85 and 55:
- \( 85 = 5 \times 17 \)
- \( 55 = 5 \times 11 \)

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved:
- LCM = \( 5 \times 11 \times 17 = 935 \)

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 935:
- For \( \frac{99}{85} \):
  \[
  \frac{99}{85} = \frac{99 \times 11}{85 \times 11} = \frac{1089}{935}

- For \( \frac{77}{55} \):
  \[
  \frac{77}{55} = \frac{77 \times 17}{55 \times 17} = \frac{1309}{935}
  \]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1089}{935} + \frac{1309}{935} = \frac{1089 + 1309}{935} = \frac{2398}{935}

To simplify \( \frac{2398}{935} \), we check for any common factors. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2398 and 935 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the value of \( \frac{97}{56} - \frac{31}{52} \), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 56 and 52. The least common multiple (LCM) of 56 and 52 can be found by determining their prime factorizations:
- 56 = \( 2^3 \times 7 \)
- 52 = \( 2^2 \times 13 \)

The LCM will be the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- LCM = \( 2^3 \times 7 \times 13 = 8 \times 7 \times 13 = 728 \)

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 728:
\[ \frac{97}{56} = \frac{97 \times 13}{56 \times 13} = \frac{1261}{728} \]
\[ \frac{31}{52} = \frac{31 \times 14}{52 \times 14} = \frac{434}{728} \]

Now, we subtract the fractions:
\[ \frac{1261}{728} - \frac{434}{728} = \frac{1261 - 434}{728} = \frac{827}{728} \]

Finally, we check if the fraction \(\frac{827}{728}\) can be simplified. Since 827 and 728 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we need to add this result to \( \frac{100}{25} \).

First, simplify \( \frac{100}{25} \):
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

Now, we need to add \( 4 \) to \( \frac{827}{728} \). To do this, we convert \( 4 \) to a fraction with the same denominator as \( \frac{827}{728} \):

Now, add the two fractions:

The denominators are 56 and 52. The least common multiple (LCM) of 56 and 52 can be found by determining their prime factorizations:
- 56 = \( 2^3 \times 7 \)
- 52 = \( 2^2 \times 13 \)

The LCM will be the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- LCM = \( 2^3 \times 7 \times 13 = 8 \times 7 \times 13 = 728 \)

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 728:
\[ \frac{97}{56} = \frac{97 \times 13}{56 \times 13} = \frac{1261}{728} \]
\[ \frac{26}{52} = \frac{26 \times 14}{52 \times 14} = \frac{364}{728} \]

Now, we subtract the fractions:
\[ \frac{1261}{728} - \frac{364}{728} = \frac{1261 - 364}{728} = \frac{897}{728} \]

Finally, we check if the fraction \(\frac{897}{728}\) can be simplified. We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 897 and 728. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
- 897 Ã· 728 = 1 remainder 169
- 728 Ã· 169 = 4 remainder 52
- 169 Ã· 52 = 3 remainder 13
- 52 Ã· 13 = 4 remainder 0

The GCD is 13. Therefore, we simplify \(\frac{897}{728}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 13:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the fraction operation \(\frac{78}{74} + \frac{72}{51}\), we first simplify each fraction if possible.

1. Simplify \(\frac{78}{74}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 78 and 74 is 2.
   - \(\frac{78}{74} = \frac{78 \div 2}{74 \div 2} = \frac{39}{37}\).

2. Simplify \(\frac{72}{51}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 51 is 3.
   - \(\frac{72}{51} = \frac{72 \div 3}{51 \div 3} = \frac{24}{17}\).

Next, we need to add the two simplified fractions \(\frac{39}{37} + \frac{24}{17}\). To do this, we find a common denominator.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 37 and 17 is 629 (since 37 and 17 are both prime numbers, their LCM is their product).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 629:
- \(\frac{39}{37} = \frac{39 \times 17}{37 \times 17} = \frac{663}{629}\)
- \(\frac{24}{17} = \frac{24 \times 37}{17 \times 37} = \frac{888}{629}\)

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{663}{629} + \frac{888}{629} = \frac{663 + 888}{629} = \frac{1551}{629}

Thus, the result of the fraction operation is \(\frac{1551}{629}\).

            Suppose in our previous operation, instead of adding (72 / 51), we were to add (56 / 51) to (78 / 74). What would be the new result of the operation (78 / 74) + (56 / 51)?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the fraction operation \(\frac{78}{74} + \frac{56}{51}\), we first simplify each fraction if possible.

1. Simplify \(\frac{78}{74}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 78 and 74 is 2.
   - \(\frac{78}{74} = \frac{78 \div 2}{74 \div 2} = \frac{39}{37}\).

2. Simplify \(\frac{56}{51}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 56 and 51 is 1 (since they have no common factors other than 1).
   - \(\frac{56}{51}\) is already in its simplest form.

Next, we need to add the two fractions \(\frac{39}{37} + \frac{56}{51}\). To do this, we find a common denominator.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 37 and 51 is 1887 (since 37 and 51 are both prime numbers, their LCM is their product).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 1887:
- \(\frac{39}{37} = \frac{39 \times 51}{37 \times 51} = \frac{1989}{1887}\)
- \(\frac{56}{51} = \frac{56 \times 37}{51 \times 37} = \frac{2072}{1887}\)

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1989}{1887} + \frac{2072}{1887} = \frac{1989 + 2072}{1887} = \frac{4061}{1887}
\]

Thus, the result of the fraction operation is \(\frac{4061}{1887}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression \((33 / 23) - (12 / 75)\), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 23 and 75. The least common multiple (LCM) of 23 and 75 is 1725, since 23 and 75 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1725:

\[
\frac{33}{23} = \frac{33 \times 75}{23 \times 75} = \frac{2475}{1725}
\]

\[
\frac{12}{75} = \frac{12 \times 23}{75 \times 23} = \frac{276}{1725}
\]

Now, we subtract the two fractions:

\[
\frac{2475}{1725} - \frac{276}{1725} = \frac{2475 - 276}{1725} = \frac{2199}{1725}
\]

Thus, the result of the operation \((33 / 23) - (12 / 75)\) is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \(\frac{2199}{1725}\) and \(\frac{24}{81}\), we first need to express both fractions with a common denominator.

The denominators are 1725 and 81. We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers. 

First, we find the prime factorizations:
- 1725 = 3 Ã— 5^2 Ã— 23
- 81 = 3^4

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- LCM = 3^4 Ã— 5^2 Ã— 23 = 207,675

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 207,675:

\[
\frac{2199}{1725} = \frac{2199 \times 120}{1725 \times 120} = \frac{263,880}{207,675}
\]

\[
\frac{24}{81} = \frac{24 \times 2565}{81 \times 2565} = \frac{61,560}{207,675}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{263,880}{207,675} + \frac{61,560}{207,675} = \frac{263,880 + 61,560}{207,675} = \frac{325,440}{207,675}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{325,440}{207,675}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 325,440 and 207,675. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the GCD is 15.

Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 15:

\[
\frac{325,440 \div 15}{207,675 \div 15} = \frac{21,696}{13,845}
\]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{2199}{1725}\) and \(\frac{24}{81}\) is:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the operation \( \frac{85}{42} - \frac{98}{99} \), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 42 and 99. The least common multiple (LCM) of 42 and 99 can be found by determining their prime factorizations:
- 42 = 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 7
- 99 = 3Â² Ã— 11

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
- LCM = 2 Ã— 3Â² Ã— 7 Ã— 11 = 2 Ã— 9 Ã— 7 Ã— 11 = 1386

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1386:
\[ \frac{85}{42} = \frac{85 \times 33}{42 \times 33} = \frac{2805}{1386} \]
\[ \frac{98}{99} = \frac{98 \times 14}{99 \times 14} = \frac{1372}{1386} \]

Now, we subtract the fractions:
\[ \frac{2805}{1386} - \frac{1372}{1386} = \frac{2805 - 1372}{1386} = \frac{1433}{1386} \]

To simplify \( \frac{1433}{1386} \) to the nearest hundredth, we perform the division:
\[ \frac{1433}{1386} \approx 1.034 \]

Thus, the result of the operation \( \frac{85}{42} - \frac{98}{99} \) simplified to the nearest hundredth is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{19}{30} \) and \( \frac{75}{77} \), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 30 and 77 is 2310.

First, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 2310:

\[
\frac{19}{30} = \frac{19 \times 77}{30 \times 77} = \frac{1463}{2310}
\]

\[
\frac{75}{77} = \frac{75 \times 30}{77 \times 30} = \frac{2250}{2310}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1463}{2310} + \frac{2250}{2310} = \frac{1463 + 2250}{2310} = \frac{3713}{2310}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{3713}{2310} \). We need to check if there is a common factor between 3713 and 2310. 

The prime factorization of 2310 is:
\[
2310 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 11
\]

The prime factorization of 3713 is:
\[
3713 = 19 \times 197

Since 3713 and 2310 have no common prime factors, the fraction \( \frac{3713}{2310} \) is already in its simplest form.

\[
\frac{19}{30} = \frac{19 \times 77}{30 \times 77} = \frac{1463}{2310}
\]

\[
\frac{75}{77} = \frac{75 \times 30}{77 \times 30} = \frac{2250}{2310}

Adding these two fractions:

\[
\frac{1463}{2310} + \frac{2250}{2310} = \frac{1463 + 2250}{2310} = \frac{3713}{2310}
\]

Next, we add \( \frac{1}{88} \) to \( \frac{3713}{2310} \). To do this, we need a common denominator for 2310 and 88. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2310 and 88 is 101640.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 101640:

\[
\frac{3713}{2310} = \frac{3713 \times 44}{2310 \times 44} = \frac{163372}{101640}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{88} = \frac{1 \times 1155}{88 \times 1155} = \frac{1155}{101640}

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{163372}{101640} + \frac{1155}{101640} = \frac{163372 + 1155}{101640} = \frac{164527}{101640}

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{164527}{101640} \). We need to check if there is a common factor between 164527 and 101640. 

The prime factorization of 101640 is:

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 66 and 64:
- 66 = 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 11
- 64 = 2^6

The LCM is the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- LCM = 2^6 Ã— 3 Ã— 11 = 64 Ã— 3 Ã— 11 = 2112

Now, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 2112:
\[

\[

\frac{3111}{2112} = \frac{3111 \times 29}{2112 \times 29} = \frac{90219}{61248}
\]
\[
\frac{10}{29} = \frac{10 \times 2112}{29 \times 2112} = \frac{21120}{61248}
\]

Next, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{90219}{61248} + \frac{21120}{61248} = \frac{90219 + 21120}{61248} = \frac{111339}{61248}
\]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{3111}{2112}\) and \(\frac{10}{29}\) is \(\frac{111339}{61248}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{57}{66}\) and \(\frac{49}{64}\), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 66 and 64 will be our common denominator.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 66 and 64:
- 66 = 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 11
- 64 = 2^6

The LCM is the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- LCM = 2^6 Ã— 3 Ã— 11 = 64 Ã— 3 Ã— 11 = 2112

Now, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 2112:
\[
\frac{57}{66} = \frac{57 \times 32}{66 \times 32} = \frac{1824}{2112}
\]
\[
\frac{49}{64} = \frac{49 \times 33}{64 \times 33} = \frac{1617}{2112}
\]

Next, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1824}{2112} + \frac{1617}{2112} = \frac{1824 + 1617}{2112} = \frac{3441}{2112}
\]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{57}{66}\) and \(\frac{49}{64}\) is \(\frac{3441}{2112}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of \( \frac{80}{13} \) and \( \frac{2}{48} \), we first need to simplify the fractions if possible and then find a common denominator.

1. Simplify \( \frac{2}{48} \):
   \[
   \frac{2}{48} = \frac{1}{24}
   \]

2. Now, we need a common denominator for \( \frac{80}{13} \) and \( \frac{1}{24} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 24 is 312.

3. Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 312:
   \[
   \frac{80}{13} = \frac{80 \times 24}{13 \times 24} = \frac{1920}{312}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{24} = \frac{1 \times 13}{24 \times 13} = \frac{13}{312}
   \]

4. Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{1920}{312} + \frac{13}{312} = \frac{1920 + 13}{312} = \frac{1933}{312}

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum when adding the result of \( \frac{80}{13} + \frac{2}{48} \) to itself, we first use the previously calculated result:

\[
\frac{80}{13} + \frac{2}{48} = \frac{1933}{312}
\]

Now, we add this result to itself:

\[
\frac{1933}{312} + \frac{1933}{312} = \frac{1933 + 1933}{312} = \frac{3866}{312}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{3866}{312} \). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3866 and 312. Using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 3866 \div 312 \approx 12 \) remainder \( 122 \)
2. \( 312 \div 122 \approx 2 \) remainder \( 68 \)
3. \( 122 \div 68 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 54 \)
4. \( 68 \div 54 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 14 \)
5. \( 54 \div 14 \approx 3 \) remainder \( 12 \)
6. \( 14 \div 12 \approx 1 \) remainder \( 2 \)
7. \( 12 \div 2 \approx 6 \) remainder \( 0 \)

The GCD is 2. Therefore, we simplify \( \frac{3866}{312} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[
\frac{3866 \div 2}{312 \div 2} = \frac{1933}{156}

2. Convert both fractions to have a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 72 is 72.

3. Convert \(\frac{11}{6}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 72:

1. Find a common denominator for the fractions \(\frac{131}{72}\) and \(\frac{73}{92}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 72 and 92 is 3312.

2. Convert \(\frac{131}{72}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 3312:
   \[
   \frac{131}{72} = \frac{131 \times 46}{72 \times 46} = \frac{6026}{3312}

3. Convert \(\frac{73}{92}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 3312:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \( \frac{69}{21} \) and \( \frac{71}{86} \), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 86 will be our common denominator.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 21 and 86:
- 21 = 3 Ã— 7
- 86 = 2 Ã— 43

The LCM of 21 and 86 is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present:
- LCM = 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 7 Ã— 43 = 1806

Now, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1806:
- For \( \frac{69}{21} \):
  \[
  \frac{69}{21} = \frac{69 \times 86}{21 \times 86} = \frac{5922}{1806}
  \]

- For \( \frac{71}{86} \):
  \[
  \frac{71}{86} = \frac{71 \times 21}{86 \times 21} = \frac{1491}{1806}
  \]

Now, we can add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{5922}{1806} + \frac{1491}{1806} = \frac{5922 + 1491}{1806} = \frac{7413}{1806}
\]

Next, we simplify \( \frac{7413}{1806} \). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7413 and 1806. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
- 7413 Ã· 1806 = 4 remainder 189
- 1806 Ã· 189 = 9 remainder 135
- 189 Ã· 135 = 1 remainder 54
- 135 Ã· 54 = 2 remainder 27
- 54 Ã· 27 = 2 remainder 0

The GCD is 27. Therefore, we simplify \( \frac{7413}{1806} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 27:
\[
\frac{7413 Ã· 27}{1806 Ã· 27} = \frac{274}{67}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{24}{60} \) and \( \frac{42}{45} \), we first simplify each fraction.

1. Simplify \( \frac{24}{60} \):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 24 and 60 is 12.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 12:
     \[
     \frac{24 \div 12}{60 \div 12} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]

2. Simplify \( \frac{42}{45} \):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 42 and 45 is 3.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
     \[
     \frac{42 \div 3}{45 \div 3} = \frac{14}{15}
     \]

Next, we need a common denominator to add the fractions \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{14}{15} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 15 is 15.

3. Convert \( \frac{2}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
   - Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
     \[
     \frac{2 \times 3}{5 \times 3} = \frac{6}{15}
     \]

Now, add the fractions \( \frac{6}{15} \) and \( \frac{14}{15} \):
\[
\frac{6}{15} + \frac{14}{15} = \frac{6 + 14}{15} = \frac{20}{15}

Finally, simplify \( \frac{20}{15} \):
- The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 15 is 5.
- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
  \[
  \frac{20 \div 5}{15 \div 5} = \frac{4}{3}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to add the fraction \( \frac{66}{12} \) to the sum \( \frac{4}{3} \) from the previous problem.

1. Simplify \( \frac{66}{12} \):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 66 and 12 is 6.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 6:
     \[
     \frac{66 \div 6}{12 \div 6} = \frac{11}{2}
     \]

Next, we need a common denominator to add the fractions \( \frac{4}{3} \) and \( \frac{11}{2} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 2 is 6.

2. Convert \( \frac{4}{3} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:
   - Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
     \[
     \frac{4 \times 2}{3 \times 2} = \frac{8}{6}
     \]

3. Convert \( \frac{11}{2} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 6:
   - Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
     \[
     \frac{11 \times 3}{2 \times 3} = \frac{33}{6}
     \]

Now, add the fractions \( \frac{8}{6} \) and \( \frac{33}{6} \):
\[
\frac{8}{6} + \frac{33}{6} = \frac{8 + 33}{6} = \frac{41}{6}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \( \frac{24}{60} \) and \( \frac{42}{67} \), we first simplify \( \frac{24}{60} \).

1. Simplify \( \frac{24}{60} \):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 24 and 60 is 12.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 12:
     \[
     \frac{24 \div 12}{60 \div 12} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]

Next, we need a common denominator to add the fractions \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{42}{67} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 67 is \( 5 \times 67 = 335 \), since 67 is a prime number.

2. Convert \( \frac{2}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 335:
   - Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 67:
     \[
     \frac{2 \times 67}{5 \times 67} = \frac{134}{335}
     \]

3. Convert \( \frac{42}{67} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 335:
   - Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5:
     \[
     \frac{42 \times 5}{67 \times 5} = \frac{210}{335}
     \]

Now, add the fractions \( \frac{134}{335} \) and \( \frac{210}{335} \):
\[
\frac{134}{335} + \frac{210}{335} = \frac{134 + 210}{335} = \frac{344}{335}
\]

Since \( \frac{344}{335} \) is already in its simplest form (the GCD of 344 and 335 is 1), this is the final answer.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{64}{76}\) and \(\frac{35}{33}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 76 and 33 will be our common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 76 and 33:
- 76 = 2^2 * 19
- 33 = 3 * 11

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
- LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 11 * 19 = 4 * 3 * 11 * 19 = 2508

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 2508:
- \(\frac{64}{76} = \frac{64 \times 33}{76 \times 33} = \frac{2112}{2508}\)
- \(\frac{35}{33} = \frac{35 \times 76}{33 \times 76} = \frac{2660}{2508}\)

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{2112}{2508} + \frac{2660}{2508} = \frac{2112 + 2660}{2508} = \frac{4772}{2508}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{4772}{2508}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4772 and 2508. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
- 4772 Ã· 2508 = 1 remainder 2264
- 2508 Ã· 2264 = 1 remainder 244
- 2264 Ã· 244 = 9 remainder 68
- 244 Ã· 68 = 3 remainder 40
- 68 Ã· 40 = 1 remainder 28
- 40 Ã· 28 = 1 remainder 12
- 28 Ã· 12 = 2 remainder 4
- 12 Ã· 4 = 3 remainder 0

The GCD is 4. Therefore, we simplify \(\frac{4772}{2508}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4:
\[
\frac{4772 Ã· 4}{2508 Ã· 4} = \frac{1193}{627}
\]

Thus, the sum of \(\frac{64}{76}\) and \(\frac{35}{33}\) is \(\frac{1193}{627}\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of adding \(\frac{47}{38}\) to the sum \(\frac{1193}{627}\), we first need to find a common denominator for \(\frac{1193}{627}\) and \(\frac{47}{38}\).

The least common multiple (LCM) of 627 and 38 will be our common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 627 and 38:
- 627 = 3 * 11 * 19
- 38 = 2 * 19

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
- LCM = 2 * 3 * 11 * 19 = 1254

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1254:
- \(\frac{1193}{627} = \frac{1193 \times 2}{627 \times 2} = \frac{2386}{1254}\)
- \(\frac{47}{38} = \frac{47 \times 33}{38 \times 33} = \frac{1551}{1254}\)

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{2386}{1254} + \frac{1551}{1254} = \frac{2386 + 1551}{1254} = \frac{3937}{1254}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{3937}{1254}\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3937 and 1254. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
- 3937 Ã· 1254 = 3 remainder 175
- 1254 Ã· 175 = 7 remainder 29
- 175 Ã· 29 = 6 remainder 1
- 29 Ã· 1 = 29 remainder 0

The GCD is 1. Therefore, \(\frac{3937}{1254}\) is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the result of adding \(\frac{47}{38}\) to the sum \(\frac{1193}{627}\) is \(\frac{3937}{1254}\).

Next, we convert each fraction to have the denominator of 80:

1. Convert \( \frac{47}{16} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 80:
\[ \frac{47}{16} = \frac{47 \times 5}{16 \times 5} = \frac{235}{80} \]

Now, we add the two fractions:

\[ \frac{47}{16} + \frac{96}{10} = \frac{1003}{80} \]

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{72}{22} \) from \( \frac{1003}{80} \). To do this, we first convert \( \frac{72}{22} \) to a fraction with a common denominator of 80.

1. Simplify \( \frac{72}{22} \):
\[ \frac{72}{22} = \frac{36}{11} \]

2. Convert \( \frac{36}{11} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 80:
\[ \frac{36}{11} = \frac{36 \times 80}{11 \times 80} = \frac{2880}{880} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to perform the division operations separately.

1. Calculate \( \frac{58}{2} \):
\[
\frac{58}{2} = 29
\]

2. Calculate \( \frac{31}{32} \):
\[
\frac{31}{32} \text{ (this fraction is already in its simplest form)}
\]

Next, we add the results of these two operations:
\[
29 + \frac{31}{32}
\]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The integer 29 can be written as a fraction with a denominator of 32:
\[
29 = \frac{29 \times 32}{32} = \frac{928}{32}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{928}{32} + \frac{31}{32} = \frac{928 + 31}{32} = \frac{959}{32}
\]

Thus, the result of the operation is:
\[
\frac{959}{32}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the result of the operation \((58 / 2) + (31 / 32)\):
\[
\frac{959}{32}
\]

Next, we need to subtract \(\frac{90}{58}\) from this result. First, simplify \(\frac{90}{58}\):
\[
\frac{90}{58} = \frac{45}{29}
\]

Now, we need to subtract \(\frac{45}{29}\) from \(\frac{959}{32}\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 32 and 29 is \(32 \times 29 = 928\).

Convert both fractions to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{959}{32} = \frac{959 \times 29}{32 \times 29} = \frac{27811}{928}
\]
\[
\frac{45}{29} = \frac{45 \times 32}{29 \times 32} = \frac{1440}{928}
\]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[
\frac{27811}{928} - \frac{1440}{928} = \frac{27811 - 1440}{928} = \frac{26371}{928}
\]

Thus, the final result is:
\[
\frac{26371}{928}

\[

\[
\frac{10}{32} = \frac{5}{16}
\]

Next, we add the results of these two operations:
\[
29 + \frac{5}{16}
\]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The integer 29 can be written as a fraction with a denominator of 16:
\[
29 = \frac{29 \times 16}{16} = \frac{464}{16}

Now, add the two fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{26}{90}\) and \(\frac{50}{26}\), we first need to find a common denominator. However, it is often easier to simplify the fractions first if possible.

1. Simplify \(\frac{26}{90}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 26 and 90 is 2.
   - \(\frac{26}{90} = \frac{26 \div 2}{90 \div 2} = \frac{13}{45}\).

2. Simplify \(\frac{50}{26}\):
   - The GCD of 50 and 26 is 2.
   - \(\frac{50}{26} = \frac{50 \div 2}{26 \div 2} = \frac{25}{13}\).

Next, we need to find a common denominator for \(\frac{13}{45}\) and \(\frac{25}{13}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 45 and 13 is 585.

3. Convert \(\frac{13}{45}\) to have a denominator of 585:
   - \(\frac{13}{45} = \frac{13 \times 13}{45 \times 13} = \frac{169}{585}\).

4. Convert \(\frac{25}{13}\) to have a denominator of 585:
   - \(\frac{25}{13} = \frac{25 \times 45}{13 \times 45} = \frac{1125}{585}\).

Now, add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{169}{585} + \frac{1125}{585} = \frac{169 + 1125}{585} = \frac{1294}{585}
\]

Finally, simplify \(\frac{1294}{585}\) if possible:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously calculated the sum of \(\frac{26}{90}\) and \(\frac{50}{26}\) as \(\frac{1294}{585}\).

Now, we need to subtract \(\frac{92}{89}\) from \(\frac{1294}{585}\).

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 585 and 89 is 52065.

1. Convert \(\frac{1294}{585}\) to have a denominator of 52065:
   \[
   \frac{1294}{585} = \frac{1294 \times 89}{585 \times 89} = \frac{115166}{52065}
   \]

2. Convert \(\frac{92}{89}\) to have a denominator of 52065:
   \[
   \frac{92}{89} = \frac{92 \times 585}{89 \times 585} = \frac{53820}{52065}
   \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[
\frac{115166}{52065} - \frac{53820}{52065} = \frac{115166 - 53820}{52065} = \frac{61346}{52065}

Finally, simplify \(\frac{61346}{52065}\) if possible:

   - \(\frac{50}{38} = \frac{50 \div 2}{38 \div 2} = \frac{25}{19}\).

Next, we need to find a common denominator for \(\frac{13}{45}\) and \(\frac{25}{19}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 45 and 19 is 855.

3. Convert \(\frac{13}{45}\) to have a denominator of 855:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of the fractions \(\frac{80}{98}\) and \(\frac{92}{82}\), we first simplify each fraction if possible.

1. Simplify \(\frac{80}{98}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 80 and 98 is 2.
   - \(\frac{80}{98} = \frac{80 \div 2}{98 \div 2} = \frac{40}{49}\).

2. Simplify \(\frac{92}{82}\):
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 92 and 82 is 2.
   - \(\frac{92}{82} = \frac{92 \div 2}{82 \div 2} = \frac{46}{41}\).

Next, we find a common denominator to add the fractions \(\frac{40}{49}\) and \(\frac{46}{41}\). The least common multiple (LCM) of 49 and 41 is 2009 (since 49 and 41 are coprime).

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator 2009:
- \(\frac{40}{49} = \frac{40 \times 41}{49 \times 41} = \frac{1640}{2009}\)
- \(\frac{46}{41} = \frac{46 \times 49}{41 \times 49} = \frac{2254}{2009}\)

Now, add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1640}{2009} + \frac{2254}{2009} = \frac{1640 + 2254}{2009} = \frac{3894}{2009}

Since 3894 and 2009 have a common factor of 1 (they are coprime), the fraction \(\frac{3894}{2009}\) is already in its simplest form.

\[
\frac{3894}{2009} + \frac{3894}{2009} = \frac{3894 + 3894}{2009} = \frac{7788}{2009}
\]

Next, we check if \(\frac{7788}{2009}\) can be simplified. We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7788 and 2009.

Using the Euclidean algorithm:
1. \(7788 \div 2009 = 3\) with a remainder of \(1761\).
2. \(2009 \div 1761 = 1\) with a remainder of \(248\).
3. \(1761 \div 248 = 7\) with a remainder of \(17\).
4. \(248 \div 17 = 14\) with a remainder of \(10\).
5. \(17 \div 10 = 1\) with a remainder of \(7\).

7. \(7 \div 3 = 2\) with a remainder of \(1\).

\frac{3481}{220} + \frac{3481}{220} = \frac{3481 + 3481}{220} = \frac{6962}{220}
\]

Thus, the result of adding the sum of \( \frac{89}{44} \) and \( \frac{69}{5} \) to itself is \( \frac{6962}{220} \).

\[
\frac{69}{38} = \frac{69 \times 22}{38 \times 22} = \frac{1518}{836}

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1691}{836} + \frac{1518}{836} = \frac{1691 + 1518}{836} = \frac{3209}{836}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the expression \( \frac{79}{32} - \frac{52}{55} \), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 32 and 55. The least common multiple (LCM) of 32 and 55 is 1760.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 1760:

1. Convert \( \frac{79}{32} \):
\[ \frac{79}{32} = \frac{79 \times 55}{32 \times 55} = \frac{4345}{1760} \]

2. Convert \( \frac{52}{55} \):
\[ \frac{52}{55} = \frac{52 \times 32}{55 \times 32} = \frac{1664}{1760} \]

Now, subtract the two fractions:
\[ \frac{4345}{1760} - \frac{1664}{1760} = \frac{4345 - 1664}{1760} = \frac{2681}{1760} \]

Thus, the result of the expression \( \frac{79}{32} - \frac{52}{55} \) is \( \frac{2681}{1760} \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the problem, we need to add the result of \( \frac{79}{32} - \frac{52}{55} \) to \( \frac{42}{99} \).

From the previous problem, we have:
\[ \frac{79}{32} - \frac{52}{55} = \frac{2681}{1760} \]

Now, we need to add \( \frac{2681}{1760} \) to \( \frac{42}{99} \). To do this, we need a common denominator for the fractions.

The denominators are 1760 and 99. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1760 and 99 is 174240.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 174240:

1. Convert \( \frac{2681}{1760} \):
\[ \frac{2681}{1760} = \frac{2681 \times 99}{1760 \times 99} = \frac{265419}{174240} \]

2. Convert \( \frac{42}{99} \):
\[ \frac{42}{99} = \frac{42 \times 1760}{99 \times 1760} = \frac{73920}{174240} \]

Now, add the two fractions:
\[ \frac{265419}{174240} + \frac{73920}{174240} = \frac{265419 + 73920}{174240} = \frac{339339}{174240} \]

Thus, the result of adding \( \frac{2681}{1760} \) to \( \frac{42}{99} \) is \( \frac{339339}{174240} \).

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine the usual length of each piece of wood. The usual length is given as \( \frac{45}{2} \) feet.

Next, we need to find out how much shorter the sold piece is compared to the usual length. The sold piece is \( \frac{18}{90} \) feet shorter.

To simplify \( \frac{18}{90} \):
\[ \frac{18}{90} = \frac{18 \div 18}{90 \div 18} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ feet} \]

Now, subtract this shorter length from the usual length:
\[ \frac{45}{2} - \frac{1}{5} \]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 5 is 10. Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 10:
\[ \frac{45}{2} = \frac{45 \times 5}{2 \times 5} = \frac{225}{10} \]
\[ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1 \times 2}{5 \times 2} = \frac{2}{10} \]

Now, subtract the fractions:
\[ \frac{225}{10} - \frac{2}{10} = \frac{225 - 2}{10} = \frac{223}{10} \]

Convert the fraction back to a decimal:
\[ \frac{223}{10} = 22.3 \text{ feet} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{99}{92}\) and \(\frac{15}{74}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 92 and 74 will serve as the common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 92 and 74:
- 92 = 2^2 * 23
- 74 = 2 * 37

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
- LCM = 2^2 * 23 * 37

Calculating the LCM:
- 2^2 = 4
- 4 * 23 = 92
- 92 * 37 = 3404

So, the common denominator is 3404.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{99}{92} = \frac{99 \times 37}{92 \times 37} = \frac{3663}{3404}
\]
\[
\frac{15}{74} = \frac{15 \times 46}{74 \times 46} = \frac{690}{3404}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{3663}{3404} + \frac{690}{3404} = \frac{3663 + 690}{3404} = \frac{4353}{3404}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{4353}{3404}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4353 and 3404. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
1. 4353 Ã· 3404 = 1 remainder 949
2. 3404 Ã· 949 = 3 remainder 557
3. 949 Ã· 557 = 1 remainder 392
4. 557 Ã· 392 = 1 remainder 165
5. 392 Ã· 165 = 2 remainder 62
6. 165 Ã· 62 = 2 remainder 41
7. 62 Ã· 41 = 1 remainder 21
8. 41 Ã· 21 = 1 remainder 20
9. 21 Ã· 20 = 1 remainder 1
10. 20 Ã· 1 = 20 remainder 0

The GCD is 1, meaning \(\frac{4353}{3404}\) is already in its simplest form.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 3404 and 71:
- 3404 = 2^2 * 23 * 37
- 71 is a prime number.

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
- LCM = 2^2 * 23 * 37 * 71

Calculating the LCM:
- 2^2 = 4
- 4 * 23 = 92
- 92 * 37 = 3404
- 3404 * 71 = 241684

So, the common denominator is 241684.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{4353}{3404} = \frac{4353 \times 71}{3404 \times 71} = \frac{309063}{241684}
\]
\[
\frac{27}{71} = \frac{27 \times 3404}{71 \times 3404} = \frac{91908}{241684}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{309063}{241684} + \frac{91908}{241684} = \frac{309063 + 91908}{241684} = \frac{400971}{241684}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{400971}{241684}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 400971 and 241684. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
1. 400971 Ã· 241684 = 1 remainder 159287
2. 241684 Ã· 159287 = 1 remainder 82397
3. 159287 Ã· 82397 = 1 remainder 76890
4. 82397 Ã· 76890 = 1 remainder 5507
5. 76890 Ã· 5507 = 13 remainder 0

The GCD is 5507, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5507:
\[
\frac{400971 Ã· 5507}{241684 Ã· 5507} = \frac{72}{44}
\]

Simplifying \(\frac{72}{44}\) further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 4:
\[
\frac{72 Ã· 4}{44 Ã· 4} = \frac{18}{11}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of the fractions \(\frac{99}{92}\) and \(\frac{15}{54}\), we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 92 and 54 will serve as the common denominator.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 92 and 54:
- 92 = 2^2 * 23
- 54 = 2 * 3^3

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
- LCM = 2^2 * 3^3 * 23

Calculating the LCM:
- 2^2 = 4
- 3^3 = 27
- 4 * 27 = 108
- 108 * 23 = 2484

So, the common denominator is 2484.

Next, we convert each fraction to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{99}{92} = \frac{99 \times 27}{92 \times 27} = \frac{2673}{2484}
\]
\[
\frac{15}{54} = \frac{15 \times 46}{54 \times 46} = \frac{690}{2484}
\]

Now, we add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{2673}{2484} + \frac{690}{2484} = \frac{2673 + 690}{2484} = \frac{3363}{2484}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{3363}{2484}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3363 and 2484. Using the Euclidean algorithm:
1. 3363 Ã· 2484 = 1 remainder 879
2. 2484 Ã· 879 = 2 remainder 726
3. 879 Ã· 726 = 1 remainder 153
4. 726 Ã· 153 = 4 remainder 108
5. 153 Ã· 108 = 1 remainder 45
6. 108 Ã· 45 = 2 remainder 18
7. 45 Ã· 18 = 2 remainder 9
8. 18 Ã· 9 = 2 remainder 0

The GCD is 9, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 9:
\[
\frac{3363 \div 9}{2484 \div 9} = \frac{373}{276}
\]

To further simplify \(\frac{373}{276}\), we check if there are any common factors. Since 373 is a prime number and does not divide 276, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's calculate each term separately.

1. The first term is \( \frac{54}{1} \):
\[
\frac{54}{1} = 54
\]

2. The second term is \( \frac{62}{30} \). We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 62 and 30. The GCD of 62 and 30 is 2. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{62 \div 2}{30 \div 2} = \frac{31}{15}
\]

Now, we add the two terms together:
\[
54 + \frac{31}{15}
\]

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 54 (which can be written as \( \frac{54}{1} \)) and \( \frac{31}{15} \) is 15. We convert 54 to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[
54 = \frac{54 \times 15}{1 \times 15} = \frac{810}{15}
\]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{810}{15} + \frac{31}{15} = \frac{810 + 31}{15} = \frac{841}{15}
\]

Thus, the result in simplest terms is:
\[
\frac{841}{15}
\]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the result of \( \frac{54}{1} + \frac{62}{30} \) which we previously calculated as \( \frac{841}{15} \).

Next, we need to subtract \( \frac{53}{41} \) from \( \frac{841}{15} \).

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 41 is 615 (since 15 and 41 are coprime).

We convert both fractions to have this common denominator:
\[
\frac{841}{15} = \frac{841 \times 41}{15 \times 41} = \frac{34481}{615}
\]
\[
\frac{53}{41} = \frac{53 \times 15}{41 \times 15} = \frac{795}{615}
\]

Now, we subtract the second fraction from the first:
\[
\frac{34481}{615} - \frac{795}{615} = \frac{34481 - 795}{615} = \frac{33686}{615}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{33686}{615} \), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 33686 and 615. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the GCD is 1, meaning the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's calculate each term separately.

1. The first term is \( \frac{93}{1} \):
\[
\frac{93}{1} = 93
\]

2. The second term is \( \frac{62}{30} \). We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 62 and 30. The GCD of 62 and 30 is 2. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:
\[
\frac{62 \div 2}{30 \div 2} = \frac{31}{15}
\]

Now, we add the two terms together:

To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 93 (which can be written as \( \frac{93}{1} \)) and \( \frac{31}{15} \) is 15. We convert 93 to a fraction with a denominator of 15:
\[
93 = \frac{93 \times 15}{1 \times 15} = \frac{1395}{15}
\]

Now, we add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1395}{15} + \frac{31}{15} = \frac{1395 + 31}{15} = \frac{1426}{15}
\]

Thus, the result in simplest terms is:

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions \( \frac{85}{29} \) and \( \frac{47}{7} \), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 29 and 7 is 203.

First, convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 203:

\[
\frac{85}{29} = \frac{85 \times 7}{29 \times 7} = \frac{595}{203}
\]

\[
\frac{47}{7} = \frac{47 \times 29}{7 \times 29} = \frac{1363}{203}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{595}{203} + \frac{1363}{203} = \frac{595 + 1363}{203} = \frac{1958}{203}
\]

Simplify the fraction if possible. In this case, 1958 and 203 have no common factors other than 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already found that the sum of \( \frac{85}{29} \) and \( \frac{47}{7} \) is \( \frac{1958}{203} \).

Now, we need to add \( \frac{81}{42} \) to this result. To do this, we need a common denominator for \( \frac{1958}{203} \) and \( \frac{81}{42} \). The least common multiple (LCM) of 203 and 42 is 4263.

First, convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 4263:

\[
\frac{1958}{203} = \frac{1958 \times 21}{203 \times 21} = \frac{41118}{4263}
\]

\[
\frac{81}{42} = \frac{81 \times 101}{42 \times 101} = \frac{8181}{4263}
\]

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{41118}{4263} + \frac{8181}{4263} = \frac{41118 + 8181}{4263} = \frac{49299}{4263}
\]

Simplify the fraction if possible. In this case, 49299 and 4263 have a common factor of 3:

\[
\frac{49299 \div 3}{4263 \div 3} = \frac{16433}{1421}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total weight of the fruits, we need to add the fractions \( \frac{85}{64} \) and \( \frac{47}{7} \). First, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 64 and 7 is 448.

Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 448:

\[
\frac{85}{64} = \frac{85 \times 7}{64 \times 7} = \frac{595}{448}
\]

\[
\frac{47}{7} = \frac{47 \times 64}{7 \times 64} = \frac{3008}{448}

Now, add the two fractions:

\[
\frac{595}{448} + \frac{3008}{448} = \frac{595 + 3008}{448} = \frac{3603}{448}
