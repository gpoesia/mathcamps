        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation \( 91 = 9a + 61 \) for the variable \( a \), follow these steps:

1. Subtract 61 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( a \):
   \[
   91 - 61 = 9a + 61 - 61
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   30 = 9a

2. Divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for \( a \):
   \[
   \frac{30}{9} = \frac{9a}{9}

   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[

   51 = 6q - 30
   \]

2. Add 30 to both sides of the equation to move the constant term on the right side to the left side:
   \[
   51 + 30 = 6q - 30 + 30
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   81 = 6q
   \]

3. Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for \( q \):
   \[
   \frac{81}{6} = \frac{6q}{6}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   q = 13.5
   \]

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

\[ d = \frac{37}{28} \]

Next, solve for \( g \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 91:

Simplify the fraction if possible:

\[ g = \frac{95}{91} = \frac{95 \div 5}{91 \div 5} = \frac{19}{18.2} \]
