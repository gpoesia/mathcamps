        A jeweler produces 423 rings each day. After 128 days of production, how many total rings have been produced?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of rings produced, we need to multiply the number of rings produced each day by the number of days of production.

Given:
- Number of rings produced each day = 423
- Number of days of production = 128

We calculate the total number of rings as follows:
\[ 423 \times 128 \]

First, we break down the multiplication for easier calculation:
\[ 423 \times 128 = 423 \times (100 + 20 + 8) \]
\[ = 423 \times 100 + 423 \times 20 + 423 \times 8 \]

Now, we calculate each term separately:
\[ 423 \times 100 = 42300 \]
\[ 423 \times 20 = 8460 \]
\[ 423 \times 8 = 3384 \]

Adding these results together:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new length of the slide after increasing it by a factor of 36, we need to multiply the original length by 36.

Original length of the slide: 631 inches

New length = Original length × Factor of increase
New length = 631 inches × 36

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
631 \times 36 = 631 \times (30 + 6) = (631 \times 30) + (631 \times 6)

First, calculate \(631 \times 30\):

Total keys sold = 14 × 6314

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[

\[ 456 \times 89 \]

First, we break down the multiplication for easier calculation:
\[ 456 \times 89 = 456 \times (90 - 1) \]
\[ = 456 \times 90 - 456 \times 1 \]
\[ = 456 \times 90 - 456 \]

First, we break down the multiplication for easier calculation:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much time the doctor spends seeing patients in one day, we need to multiply the number of patients by the duration of each visit.

Number of patients: 19
Duration of each visit: 1943 seconds

Total time spent = Number of patients × Duration of each visit
Total time spent = 19 × 1943

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
19 \times 1943 = 19 \times (2000 - 57) = (19 \times 2000) - (19 \times 57)
\]

First, calculate \(19 \times 2000\):

\[
19 \times 2000 = 38000
\]

Next, calculate \(19 \times 57\):

\[
19 \times 57 = 19 \times (50 + 7) = (19 \times 50) + (19 \times 7)
\]

\[
19 \times 50 = 950
\]

\[
19 \times 7 = 133
\]

Adding these together:

\[
950 + 133 = 1083
\]

Now, subtract \(1083\) from \(38000\):

\[
38000 - 1083 = 36917

So, the total time the doctor spends seeing patients in one day is:

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much time the doctor spends seeing patients in one day with each visit lasting 2822 seconds, we need to multiply the number of patients by the duration of each visit.

Number of patients: 19
Duration of each visit: 2822 seconds

Total time spent = Number of patients × Duration of each visit
Total time spent = 19 × 2822

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
19 \times 2822 = 19 \times (2800 + 22) = (19 \times 2800) + (19 \times 22)
\]

First, calculate \(19 \times 2800\):

\[
19 \times 2800 = 19 \times (28 \times 100) = (19 \times 28) \times 100
\]

\[
19 \times 28 = 532
\]

\[
532 \times 100 = 53200
\]

Next, calculate \(19 \times 22\):

\[
19 \times 22 = 19 \times (20 + 2) = (19 \times 20) + (19 \times 2)
\]

\[
19 \times 20 = 380
\]

\[
19 \times 2 = 38
\]

Adding these together:

\[
380 + 38 = 418
\]

Now, add \(53200\) and \(418\):

\[
53200 + 418 = 53618
\]

So, the total time the doctor spends seeing patients in one day is:

\[
19 \times 2822 = 53618 \text{ seconds}
\]

\[ = 600 \times 100 + 600 \times 20 + 600 \times 3 \]
\[ = 60000 + 12000 + 1800 \]

Given:

Total weight = 2885 kg × 29

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

First, calculate \( 2885 \times 30 \):

Total weight = 1926 kg × 29

The fairy spreads magic dust 43 times a day, and each time she uses 2230 particles.

So, we calculate:
\[ 43 \times 2230 \]

First, let's break it down for easier multiplication:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much the bakery earned, we need to multiply the number of cakes sold by the price per cake.

Number of cakes sold: 43

First, we break it down for easier calculation:
\[ 43 \times 1562 = 43 \times (1500 + 62) \]
\[ = 43 \times 1500 + 43 \times 62 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

        A plane flies at a speed of 850 kilometers per hour. If it flies continuously for 109 hours, how many kilometers will it have flown?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total distance flown by the plane, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Speed of the plane = 850 kilometers per hour
- Time flown = 109 hours

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = 850 \, \text{km/h} \times 109 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ 850 \times 109 = 850 \times (100 + 9) = (850 \times 100) + (850 \times 9) \]
\[ 850 \times 100 = 85000 \]
\[ 850 \times 9 = 7650 \]

Add these two results together:

\[ 85000 + 7650 = 92650 \]

Therefore, the plane will have flown 92,650 kilometers.

        If the plane was flying at a slower speed of 43 kilometers per hour instead of 850 kilometers per hour. How many kilometers would the plane have flown now after 109 hours?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total distance flown by the plane at the slower speed, we use the same distance formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Speed of the plane = 43 kilometers per hour
- Time flown = 109 hours

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = 43 \, \text{km/h} \times 109 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[ 43 \times 109 = 43 \times (100 + 9) = (43 \times 100) + (43 \times 9) \]
\[ 43 \times 100 = 4300 \]
\[ 43 \times 9 = 387 \]

Add these two results together:

\[ 4300 + 387 = 4687 \]

Therefore, the plane will have flown 4,687 kilometers.

        An ice skate store sold 548 pairs of ice skates each week. If ice skating season lasts 179 weeks, how many pairs of ice skates did the store sell in total during that time?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of pairs of ice skates sold during the ice skating season, we need to multiply the number of pairs sold each week by the number of weeks in the season.

Given:
- Number of pairs sold each week = 548
- Number of weeks in the season = 179

We calculate the total as follows:
\[ 548 \times 179 \]

First, we break down the multiplication for easier calculation:
\[ 548 \times 179 = 548 \times (180 - 1) \]
\[ = 548 \times 180 - 548 \times 1 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:
\[ 548 \times 180 = 548 \times (100 + 80) \]
\[ = 548 \times 100 + 548 \times 80 \]
\[ = 54800 + 43840 \]
\[ = 98640 \]

Next, subtract the second part:
\[ 548 \times 1 = 548 \]

So, the total number of pairs sold is:

We calculate the total as follows:
\[ 548 \times 148 \]

First, we break down the multiplication for easier calculation:

\[ = 548 \times 150 - 548 \times 2 \]

Given:
- Number of crew members = 475

We perform the multiplication:

\[ 475 \times 89 \]

First, we break it down using the distributive property:

\[ 475 \times 89 = 475 \times (90 - 1) \]
\[ = 475 \times 90 - 475 \times 1 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

First, calculate \( 475 \times 9 \):

Then multiply by 10:

\[ 4275 \times 10 = 42750 \]

Next, calculate \( 475 \times 1 \):

First, we can break this multiplication into simpler parts:
\[ 220 \times 380 = 220 \times (300 + 80) \]
\[ = 220 \times 300 + 220 \times 80 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:
\[ 220 \times 300 = 66000 \]
\[ 220 \times 80 = 17600 \]

Add these two results together:
\[ 66000 + 17600 = 83600 \]

Thus, the total number of additional carrots harvested is:

        A bead shop sells individual beads for making necklaces. Each bead costs 1056 dollars and a designer buys 37 of them for a fancy necklace. How much does she spend on beads?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how much the designer spends on beads, we need to multiply the cost of one bead by the number of beads she buys.

The cost of one bead is $1056, and she buys 37 beads.

So, we calculate:
\[ 1056 \times 37 \]

First, let's break it down using the distributive property:
\[ 1056 \times 37 = 1056 \times (30 + 7) \]
\[ = 1056 \times 30 + 1056 \times 7 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:
\[ 1056 \times 30 = 1056 \times 3 \times 10 = 3168 \times 10 = 31680 \]
\[ 1056 \times 7 = 7392 \]

Finally, add the two results together:
\[ 31680 + 7392 = 39072 \]

First, let's break it down using the distributive property:

\[ = 1978 \times 30 + 1978 \times 7 \]

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of fish consumed by the group of penguins over 3327 days, we need to multiply the average daily consumption by the number of days.

The average daily consumption is 19 kg, and the number of days is 3327.

\[
\text{Total amount of fish} = 19 \, \text{kg/day} \times 3327 \, \text{days}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
19 \times 3327 = 19 \times (3300 + 27) = (19 \times 3300) + (19 \times 27)

First, calculate \(19 \times 3300\):

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of bolts used, we need to multiply the number of bolts used for each jungle gym by the number of jungle gyms built.

Given:
- Number of bolts per jungle gym = 1429
- Number of jungle gyms built = 47

We calculate the total number of bolts as follows:
\[ 1429 \times 47 \]

First, we break down the multiplication for easier calculation:
\[ 1429 \times 47 = 1429 \times (40 + 7) \]
\[ = 1429 \times 40 + 1429 \times 7 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:
\[ 1429 \times 40 = 1429 \times 4 \times 10 = 5716 \times 10 = 57160 \]
\[ 1429 \times 7 = 10000 - 1000 + 300 - 70 + 3 = 10003 \]

We perform the multiplication:
\[ 148 \times 637 \]

First, we break it down using the distributive property:

Given:
- Number of trees = 874
- Number of birds per tree = 68

We perform the multiplication:

First, we break it down:
\[ 874 \times 68 = 874 \times (70 - 2) \]
\[ = 874 \times 70 - 874 \times 2 \]

Now, calculate each part:
\[ 874 \times 70 = 874 \times (7 \times 10) = (874 \times 7) \times 10 \]
\[ 874 \times 7 = 6118 \]

        A bike shop had 3978 bicycle tires in stock. If the bike shop sold the tires in sets of 21, how many tires did they sell altogether?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many tires the bike shop sold altogether, we need to find out how many sets of 21 tires were sold from the total stock of 3978 tires.

First, we divide the total number of tires by the number of tires in each set:
\[ \frac{3978}{21} \]

Performing the division:
\[ 3978 \div 21 = 189.428571 \]

Since the bike shop can only sell whole sets of tires, we take the integer part of the division result, which is 189 sets.

Next, we calculate the total number of tires sold by multiplying the number of sets by the number of tires in each set:
\[ 189 \times 21 = 3969 \]

Thus, the bike shop sold 3969 tires altogether.

        A factory produces 181 chips for a computer every hour. If it works non-stop for 475 hours, how many chips would the factory have produced in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total number of chips produced by the factory, we need to multiply the number of chips produced per hour by the total number of hours worked.

Given:
- Chips produced per hour = 181
- Total hours worked = 475

We calculate the total number of chips as follows:
\[ \text{Total chips} = 181 \times 475 \]

Let's perform the multiplication step-by-step:

1. Multiply 181 by 5:
\[ 181 \times 5 = 905 \]

2. Multiply 181 by 70 (since 70 is 10 times 7):
\[ 181 \times 70 = 181 \times (7 \times 10) = (181 \times 7) \times 10 \]
\[ 181 \times 7 = 1267 \]
\[ 1267 \times 10 = 12670 \]

3. Multiply 181 by 400:
\[ 181 \times 400 = 181 \times (4 \times 100) = (181 \times 4) \times 100 \]
\[ 181 \times 4 = 724 \]
\[ 724 \times 100 = 72400 \]

4. Add the results of the three multiplications:
\[ 905 + 12670 + 72400 = 85975 \]

Thus, the factory would have produced a total of 85,975 chips in 475 hours.
