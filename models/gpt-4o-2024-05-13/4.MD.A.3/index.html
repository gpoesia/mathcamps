        In the previous rectangle question, suppose one of the sides measuring 45m was incorrectly assessed. The actual measurement is found to be 42m. With this new information, what would be the adjusted perimeter of the rectangle?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the adjusted perimeter of the rectangle with the corrected side measurement, we need to use the new side lengths.

Given:
- One side is corrected to 42 meters.
- The other side remains 45 meters.
- The other two sides measure 25 meters each.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the corrected values:
\[ P = 2 \times (42 \, \text{m} + 25 \, \text{m}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 67 \, \text{m} \]
\[ P = 134 \, \text{m} \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the rectangle has identical sides, each measuring 19 meters, it means the length and the width are both 19 meters.

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (19 + 19) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 38 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 76 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">For a square, all four sides are of equal length. The perimeter of a square is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{Side length} \]

Given:
- Side length = 26 meters

We multiply the side length by 4 to find the perimeter:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times 26 = 104 \]

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Continuing from the previous scenario, imagine the length of the rectangle stayed the same at 24m, but the width was reduced to 17m. Now, what would be the new perimeter of this rectangle?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new perimeter of the rectangle with the updated width, we use the same perimeter formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Given:
- Length (\(L\)) = 24 meters
- New Width (\(W\)) = 17 meters

First, we add the length and the new width:

\[ L + W = 24 + 17 = 41 \]

Next, we multiply the sum by 2 to find the new perimeter:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 41 = 82 \]

### Answer: 82 meters</pre>

        The length and width of a rectangle are both 32m. What is the perimeter of this rectangle?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Given that both the length and the width of the rectangle are 32 meters, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (32 \, \text{m} + 32 \, \text{m}) \]

First, add the length and the width:

\[ 32 \, \text{m} + 32 \, \text{m} = 64 \, \text{m} \]

Next, multiply by 2:

\[ 2 \times 64 \, \text{m} = 128 \, \text{m} \]

        The length of the rectangle from the previous problem remains the same, but the width of the rectangle is now adjusted to 13m. What is the new perimeter of this rectangle?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new perimeter of the rectangle with the updated width, we use the same perimeter formula:

Substitute these values into the formula:
