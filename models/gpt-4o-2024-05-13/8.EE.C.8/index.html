            Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121
        </p>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

1. \( 40s - 91q = 37 \)
2. \( 30s + 12q = 121 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's eliminate one of the variables. We can start by making the coefficients of \( q \) in both equations equal. To do this, we can multiply the first equation by 12 and the second equation by 91:

\[
12(40s - 91q) = 12(37)
\]
\[
91(30s + 12q) = 91(121)
\]

This gives us:

\[
480s - 1092q = 444
\]
\[
2730s + 1092q = 11011
\]

Now, we add these two equations to eliminate \( q \):

\[
480s - 1092q + 2730s + 1092q = 444 + 11011
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
3210s = 11455
\]

Solving for \( s \):

\[
s = \frac{11455}{3210} = \frac{2291}{642}
\]

Next, we substitute \( s \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( q \). Let's use the second equation:

\[
30s + 12q = 121
\]

Substitute \( s = \frac{2291}{642} \):

\[
30 \left( \frac{2291}{642} \right) + 12q = 121
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{30 \times 2291}{642} + 12q = 121
\]

\[
\frac{68730}{642} + 12q = 121
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
107.06 + 12q = 121
\]

Subtract 107.06 from both sides:

\[
12q = 121 - 107.06
\]

\[
12q = 13.94
\]

Solve for \( q \):

\[
q = \frac{13.94}{12} \approx 1.16
\]

1. \( 4b + 44m = 180 \)
2. \( 79m - 6b = 48 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's simplify the first equation by dividing everything by 4:

\[ b + 11m = 45 \]

So, the system now looks like this:

1. \( b + 11m = 45 \)
2. \( 79m - 6b = 48 \)

Next, we can multiply the first equation by 6 to align the coefficients of \( b \):

\[ 6(b + 11m) = 6 \cdot 45 \]
\[ 6b + 66m = 270 \]

Now, we have:

1. \( 6b + 66m = 270 \)
2. \( 79m - 6b = 48 \)

We can add these two equations to eliminate \( b \):

\[ (6b + 66m) + (79m - 6b) = 270 + 48 \]
\[ 145m = 318 \]

Solving for \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{318}{145} \]
\[ m = 2.2 \]

Now, substitute \( m = 2.2 \) back into the simplified first equation \( b + 11m = 45 \):

\[ b + 11(2.2) = 45 \]
\[ b + 24.2 = 45 \]
\[ b = 45 - 24.2 \]
\[ b = 20.8 \]

So, the values of \( b \) and \( m \) are:

2. \( 47o + 29g = 141 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply both equations by suitable numbers to make the coefficients of \( o \) the same in both equations. We can multiply the first equation by 47 and the second equation by 42:

\[
47(42o - 15g) = 47(28)
\]
\[
42(47o + 29g) = 42(141)
\]

This gives us:

\[
1974o - 705g = 1316
\]
\[
1974o + 1218g = 5922
\]

Next, we subtract the first modified equation from the second modified equation to eliminate \( o \):

\[
(1974o + 1218g) - (1974o - 705g) = 5922 - 1316
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
1974o + 1218g - 1974o + 705g = 4606
\]
\[
1923g = 4606
\]

Solving for \( g \):

\[
g = \frac{4606}{1923}
\]
\[
g = 2.395
\]

Now, substitute \( g = 2.395 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( o \). We'll use the first equation:

\[
42o - 15(2.395) = 28
\]
\[
42o - 35.925 = 28
\]
\[
42o = 28 + 35.925

\[
42o = 63.925

\[
o = \frac{63.925}{42}

\[

1. \( 12v - 6o = 21 \)
2. \( 76v - 45o = 50 \)

First, let's simplify the first equation by dividing all terms by 3:

\[ 4v - 2o = 7 \]

Now, we have:

1. \( 4v - 2o = 7 \)
2. \( 76v - 45o = 50 \)

Next, we will multiply the first equation by 22.5 to align the coefficients of \( o \) for elimination:

\[ 22.5 \times (4v - 2o) = 22.5 \times 7 \]
\[ 90v - 45o = 157.5 \]

Now, we have:

1. \( 90v - 45o = 157.5 \)
2. \( 76v - 45o = 50 \)

Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate \( o \):

\[ (90v - 45o) - (76v - 45o) = 157.5 - 50 \]
\[ 14v = 107.5 \]

Solve for \( v \):

1. \( 75f + 25g = 138 \)
2. \( 2f + 90g = 143 \)

First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing all terms by 25:

\[ 75f + 25g = 138 \]
\[ \frac{75f}{25} + \frac{25g}{25} = \frac{138}{25} \]
\[ 3f + g = 5.52 \]

So, the simplified system of equations is:

1. \( 3f + g = 5.52 \)
2. \( 2f + 90g = 143 \)

Next, we can solve for \( g \) in terms of \( f \) from the first equation:

\[ g = 5.52 - 3f \]

Now, substitute \( g = 5.52 - 3f \) into the second equation:

\[ 2f + 90(5.52 - 3f) = 143 \]
\[ 2f + 90 \cdot 5.52 - 90 \cdot 3f = 143 \]
\[ 2f + 496.8 - 270f = 143 \]
\[ 2f - 270f = 143 - 496.8 \]
\[ -268f = -353.8 \]

we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's rewrite the equations for clarity:
\[ 4y + 14n = 194 \]
\[ -79y + 65n = 7 \]

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the first equation by a suitable number so that the coefficients of \( y \) or \( n \) in both equations become equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let's eliminate \( y \).

Multiply the first equation by 79:
\[ 79(4y + 14n) = 79 \cdot 194 \]
\[ 316y + 1106n = 15326 \]

Now, multiply the second equation by 4:
\[ 4(-79y + 65n) = 4 \cdot 7 \]
\[ -316y + 260n = 28 \]

Now we have:
\[ 316y + 1106n = 15326 \]
\[ -316y + 260n = 28 \]

Add these two equations to eliminate \( y \):
\[ (316y + 1106n) + (-316y + 260n) = 15326 + 28 \]
\[ 1366n = 15354 \]

Solve for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{15354}{1366} \]
\[ n = 11.24 \]

Now substitute \( n = 11.24 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( y \). Using the first equation:
\[ 4y + 14(11.24) = 194 \]
\[ 4y + 157.36 = 194 \]
\[ 4y = 194 - 157.36 \]
\[ 4y = 36.64 \]
\[ y = \frac{36.64}{4} \]
\[ y = 9.16 \]

So, the solution to the system of equations is:

First, let's rewrite the equations for clarity:
\[ 28g + 26l = 146 \]
\[ -53g + 41l = 6 \]

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the first equation by 53 and the second equation by 28, so that the coefficients of \( g \) will be the same (but opposite in sign):

\[ 53(28g + 26l) = 53(146) \]
\[ 28(-53g + 41l) = 28(6) \]

This gives us:
\[ 1484g + 1378l = 7738 \]
\[ -1484g + 1148l = 168 \]

Now, add these two equations together to eliminate \( g \):

\[ (1484g - 1484g) + (1378l + 1148l) = 7738 + 168 \]
\[ 0g + 2526l = 7906 \]
\[ 2526l = 7906 \]

Solve for \( l \):

\[ l = 3.13 \]

Now, substitute \( l = 3.13 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( g \). We'll use the first equation:

\[ 28g + 81.38 = 146 \]
\[ 28g = 146 - 81.38 \]
\[ 28g = 64.62 \]
\[ g = \frac{64.62}{28} \]
\[ g = 2.31 \]

56(89p + 7y) = 56(98)
\]

This gives us:

\[
140p + 392y = 630
\]
\[
4984p + 392y = 5488
\]

Now, subtract the first modified equation from the second modified equation to eliminate \( y \):

\[
(4984p + 392y) - (140p + 392y) = 5488 - 630
\]

Simplify:

\[
4844p = 4858
\]

Solve for \( p \):

\[
p = \frac{4858}{4844} = 1.00289 \approx 1
\]

Now substitute \( p \approx 1 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( y \). We'll use the first equation:

\[
20(1) + 56y = 90
\]

Simplify:

\[
20 + 56y = 90
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[
56y = 70
\]

Solve for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{70}{56} = 1.25
\]

So, the values of \( p \) and \( y \) are approximately:

            Given the system of equations: 72*k - 22*d = 17 and 6*d +69*k = 96, find the values of variables k and d.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

1) \( 72k - 22d = 17 \)
2) \( 6d + 69k = 96 \)

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's align the equations for clarity:

\[
72k - 22d = 17 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]
\[
69k + 6d = 96 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the equations by suitable numbers so that the coefficients of one of the variables are opposites. Let's eliminate \(d\). 

Multiply Equation 1 by 3 and Equation 2 by 11:

\[
3(72k - 22d) = 3(17) \implies 216k - 66d = 51 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]
\[
11(69k + 6d) = 11(96) \implies 759k + 66d = 1056 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Now, add Equation 3 and Equation 4:

\[
216k - 66d + 759k + 66d = 51 + 1056
\]
\[
(216k + 759k) + (-66d + 66d) = 1107
\]
\[
975k = 1107
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
k = \frac{1107}{975} = \frac{369}{325} = \frac{123}{108} = \frac{41}{36}
\]

Now, substitute \(k = \frac{41}{36}\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(d\). We'll use Equation 2:

\[
69k + 6d = 96
\]
\[
69 \left(\frac{41}{36}\right) + 6d = 96
\]
\[
\frac{69 \cdot 41}{36} + 6d = 96
\]
\[
\frac{2829}{36} + 6d = 96
\]
\[
78.5833 + 6d = 96
\]
\[
6d = 96 - 78.5833
\]
\[
6d = 17.4167
\]
\[
d = \frac{17.4167}{6} \approx 2.9028
\]

Thus, the values of \(k\) and \(d\) are approximately:

1. \( 73h - 33d = 48 \)
2. \( 10d + 14h = 91 \)

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply the second equation by a factor that will allow us to eliminate one of the variables when we add or subtract the equations. We can multiply the second equation by 33 to match the coefficient of \( d \) in the first equation:

\[ 33(10d + 14h) = 33(91) \]
\[ 330d + 462h = 3003 \]

Now we have the system:

1. \( 73h - 33d = 48 \)
2. \( 330d + 462h = 3003 \)

Next, let's multiply the first equation by 10 to match the coefficient of \( d \) in the second equation:

\[ 10(73h - 33d) = 10(48) \]
\[ 730h - 330d = 480 \]

Now we have the system:

1. \( 730h - 330d = 480 \)
2. \( 330d + 462h = 3003 \)

Add the two equations to eliminate \( d \):

\[ 730h - 330d + 330d + 462h = 480 + 3003 \]
\[ 1192h = 3483 \]

Solve for \( h \):

\[ h = \frac{3483}{1192} \]
\[ h = 2.92 \]

Now substitute \( h = 2.92 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( d \). We'll use the second equation:

\[ 10d + 14(2.92) = 91 \]
\[ 10d + 40.88 = 91 \]
\[ 10d = 91 - 40.88 \]
\[ 10d = 50.12 \]
\[ d = \frac{50.12}{10} \]
\[ d = 5.012 \]

2) \( 30q + 43e = 130 \)

we can use the method of elimination. First, we will eliminate one of the variables by making the coefficients of \( e \) in both equations equal.

Multiply the first equation by 43 and the second equation by 44:

\[
43(43q - 44e) = 43(29)
\]
\[
44(30q + 43e) = 44(130)
\]

This gives us:

\[
1849q - 1892e = 1247
\]
\[
1320q + 1892e = 5720
\]

Now, add the two equations to eliminate \( e \):

\[
1849q - 1892e + 1320q + 1892e = 1247 + 5720
\]

Simplify:

\[
3169q = 6967

Solve for \( q \):

\[

Simplify:

\[
66 + 43e = 130

Subtract 66 from both sides:

1. \( 53 = 89r - 74a \)
2. \( 109 = 37a + 6r \)

we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's rewrite the equations for clarity:

\[
53 = 89r - 74a \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]
\[
109 = 37a + 6r \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the equations by suitable numbers so that the coefficients of one of the variables are the same. Let's eliminate \( r \).

Multiply Equation 1 by 6 and Equation 2 by 89:

\[
6 \cdot 53 = 6 \cdot (89r - 74a)
\]
\[
318 = 534r - 444a \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]

\[
89 \cdot 109 = 89 \cdot (37a + 6r)
\]
\[
9701 = 3293a + 534r \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Now, subtract Equation 3 from Equation 4 to eliminate \( r \):

\[
9701 - 318 = 3293a + 534r - 534r - 444a
\]
\[
9383 = 3293a - 444a

\[
9383 = 2849a

Solve for \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{9383}{2849}

\[
a = 3.29

Now substitute \( a = 3.29 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( r \). We'll use Equation 2:

\[
109 = 37(3.29) + 6r

\[
109 = 121.73 + 6r

Subtract 121.73 from both sides:

\[
109 - 121.73 = 6r

\[
-12.73 = 6r

1. \( 42g + 12q = 169 \)
2. \( 12q - 50g = 19 \)

First, we solve the second equation for \( q \):

\[ 12q = 50g + 19 \]
\[ q = \frac{50g + 19}{12} \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( q \) into the first equation:

\[ 42g + 12\left(\frac{50g + 19}{12}\right) = 169 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 42g + 50g + 19 = 169 \]
\[ 92g + 19 = 169 \]

Subtract 19 from both sides:

\[ 92g = 150 \]

Divide both sides by 92:

\[ g = \frac{150}{92} \]
\[ g = \frac{75}{46} \]
\[ g \approx 1.6304 \]

Now, substitute \( g \approx 1.6304 \) back into the expression for \( q \):

\[ q = \frac{81.52 + 19}{12} \]
\[ q = \frac{100.52}{12} \]

First, we need to make the coefficients of either \( s \) or \( v \) the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( s \) by making the coefficients of \( s \) in both equations equal.

Multiply the first equation by 82 and the second equation by 37:

\[ 82 \times (37s - 11v) = 82 \times 54 \]
\[ 37 \times (82s - 62v) = 37 \times 41 \]

This gives us:

\[ 3034s - 902v = 4428 \]
\[ 3034s - 2294v = 1517 \]

Now, subtract the second equation from the first:

\[ (3034s - 902v) - (3034s - 2294v) = 4428 - 1517 \]
\[ 1392v = 2911 \]

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 48 and the second equation by 41 to align the coefficients of \( c \):

\[ 48(41c + 65z) = 48(151) \]
\[ 41(78z - 48c) = 41(48) \]

This gives us:

\[ 1968c + 3120z = 7248 \]
\[ 3198z - 1968c = 1968 \]

Now, add these two equations to eliminate \( c \):

\[ 1968c + 3120z + 3198z - 1968c = 7248 + 1968 \]
\[ 6318z = 9216 \]

Solve for \( z \):

\[ z = \frac{9216}{6318} \]
\[ z = \frac{1536}{1053} \]
\[ z = \frac{512}{351} \]

Now, substitute \( z \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( c \). We'll use the first equation:

\[ 41c + 65 \left(\frac{512}{351}\right) = 151 \]

First, simplify \( 65 \left(\frac{512}{351}\right) \):

\[ 65 \left(\frac{512}{351}\right) = \frac{33280}{351} \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 41c + \frac{33280}{351} = 151 \]

Multiply through by 351 to clear the fraction:

\[ 41c \cdot 351 + 33280 = 151 \cdot 351 \]
\[ 14391c + 33280 = 52901 \]

Subtract 33280 from both sides:

\[ 14391c = 19621 \]

\[ c = \frac{19621}{14391} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

\[ 60c - 91i = 7 \]
\[ 7i + 76c = 148 \]

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 13 to align the coefficients of \(i\):

\[ 13(7i + 76c) = 13(148) \]
\[ 91i + 988c = 1924 \]

Now we have the system:

\[ 60c - 91i = 7 \]
\[ 988c + 91i = 1924 \]

Next, add the two equations to eliminate \(i\):

\[ (60c - 91i) + (988c + 91i) = 7 + 1924 \]
\[ 60c + 988c = 1931 \]
\[ 1048c = 1931 \]

Solve for \(c\):

\[ c = \frac{1931}{1048} \]
\[ c = \frac{1931}{1048} \approx 1.842 \]

Now substitute \(c\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(i\). We'll use the second equation:

\[ 7i + 76c = 148 \]
\[ 7i + 76 \left(\frac{1931}{1048}\right) = 148 \]
\[ 7i + \frac{146756}{1048} = 148 \]
\[ 7i + 140 = 148 \]
\[ 7i = 148 - 140 \]
\[ 7i = 8 \]
\[ i = \frac{8}{7} \]
\[ i \approx 1.143 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of linear equations:

1) \( 71v - 37e = 69 \)
2) \( 41e + 76v = 184 \)

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 41 and the second equation by 37 to align the coefficients of \( e \):

\[
41(71v - 37e) = 41(69)
\]
\[
37(41e + 76v) = 37(184)
\]

This gives us:

\[
2911v - 1517e = 2829
\]
\[
1517e + 2812v = 6808
\]

Next, we add these two equations to eliminate \( e \):

\[
2911v - 1517e + 1517e + 2812v = 2829 + 6808
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
5723v = 9637
\]

Solving for \( v \):

\[
v = \frac{9637}{5723} \approx 1.683
\]

Now, substitute \( v \approx 1.683 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( e \). We'll use the first equation:

\[
71(1.683) - 37e = 69
\]

\[
119.493 - 37e = 69
\]

\[
119.493 - 69 = 37e
\]

\[
50.493 = 37e
\]

\[
e = \frac{50.493}{37} \approx 1.364
\]

Thus, the values of \( e \) and \( v \) that satisfy the given equations are approximately:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use the elimination method.

The given system of equations is:
1) \( 25v + 69d = 113 \)
2) \( 26d + 42v = 85 \)

First, we will align the equations for clarity:
\[ 25v + 69d = 113 \]
\[ 42v + 26d = 85 \]

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the equations by appropriate constants so that the coefficients of one of the variables are the same. Let's eliminate \(v\) by making the coefficients of \(v\) in both equations equal.

Multiply the first equation by 42 and the second equation by 25:
\[ 42(25v + 69d) = 42(113) \]
\[ 25(42v + 26d) = 25(85) \]

This gives us:
\[ 1050v + 2898d = 4746 \]
\[ 1050v + 650d = 2125 \]

Now, subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \(v\):
\[ (1050v + 2898d) - (1050v + 650d) = 4746 - 2125 \]
\[ 2898d - 650d = 2621 \]
\[ 2248d = 2621 \]

Solve for \(d\):
\[ d = \frac{2621}{2248} \]
\[ d = 1.165 \]

Now, substitute \(d = 1.165\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(v\). We use the first equation:
\[ 25v + 69(1.165) = 113 \]
\[ 25v + 80.385 = 113 \]
\[ 25v = 113 - 80.385 \]
\[ 25v = 32.615 \]
\[ v = \frac{32.615}{25} \]
\[ v = 1.305 \]

Thus, the values of \(d\) and \(v\) are:

1. \( 43z - 91g = 33 \)
2. \( 72g - 3z = 68 \)

First, we will solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve the second equation for \( z \):

\[ 72g - 3z = 68 \]
\[ -3z = 68 - 72g \]
\[ z = \frac{68 - 72g}{-3} \]
\[ z = \frac{72g - 68}{3} \]

Now, substitute this expression for \( z \) into the first equation:

\[ 43 \left( \frac{72g - 68}{3} \right) - 91g = 33 \]

Multiply through by 3 to clear the fraction:

\[ 43(72g - 68) - 273g = 99 \]
\[ 3096g - 2924 - 273g = 99 \]
\[ 2823g - 2924 = 99 \]

Add 2924 to both sides:

\[ 2823g = 3023 \]

Divide by 2823:

\[ g = \frac{3023}{2823} \]
\[ g \approx 1.071 \]

Now, substitute \( g \approx 1.071 \) back into the expression for \( z \):

\[ z = \frac{72(1.071) - 68}{3} \]
\[ z = \frac{77.112 - 68}{3} \]
\[ z = \frac{9.112}{3} \]
\[ z \approx 3.037 \]

Thus, the approximate solutions for \( g \) and \( z \) are:

Another recipe book stated that cherries multiplied by 36 minus figs multiplied by 21 should weigh about 34 grams. Can you find the quantity of cherries (c) and figs (f)? Use the following system of equations to solve:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

1. \( 50c + 12f = 92 \)
2. \( 36c - 21f = 34 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of \( f \) the same:

\[
3(50c + 12f) = 3(92)
\]
\[
2(36c - 21f) = 2(34)
\]

This gives us:

\[
150c + 36f = 276
\]
\[
72c - 42f = 68
\]

Next, we add these two equations to eliminate \( f \):

\[
150c + 36f + 72c - 42f = 276 + 68
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
222c - 6f = 344
\]

Now, let's solve for \( c \):

\[
222c = 344
\]
\[
c = \frac{344}{222}
\]
\[
c = \frac{172}{111}
\]
\[
c = \frac{86}{55}
\]

Now, substitute \( c = \frac{86}{55} \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( f \). We'll use the first equation:

\[
50c + 12f = 92
\]

Substitute \( c \):

\[
50 \left(\frac{86}{55}\right) + 12f = 92
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{4300}{55} + 12f = 92
\]

Convert \( \frac{4300}{55} \) to a decimal:

\[
78.18 + 12f = 92
\]

Subtract 78.18 from both sides:

\[
12f = 92 - 78.18
\]
\[
12f = 13.82
\]

Solve for \( f \):

\[
f = \frac{13.82}{12}
\]
\[
f = 1.1516667
\]

So, the quantities of cherries and figs are:

First, we will try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate \( u \). To do this, we need to make the coefficients of \( u \) in both equations equal. We can achieve this by multiplying the first equation by 82 and the second equation by 87:

\[ 82(87u - 75d) = 82 \cdot 7 \]
\[ 87(85d - 82u) = 87 \cdot 54 \]

This gives us:

\[ 7134u - 6150d = 574 \]
\[ 7395d - 7134u = 4698 \]

Now, we add these two equations together to eliminate \( u \):

\[ 1245d = 5272 \]

Solving for \( d \):

\[ d = \frac{5272}{1245} \]
\[ d = 4.2345 \]

1. \( 75a - 4i = 42 \)
2. \( 10i + 13a = 160 \)

First, let's solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other. We'll start with the second equation:

\[ 10i + 13a = 160 \]

Solve for \( i \):

\[ 10i = 160 - 13a \]
\[ i = \frac{160 - 13a}{10} \]

Now, substitute this expression for \( i \) into the first equation:

\[ 75a - 4\left(\frac{160 - 13a}{10}\right) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 75a - \frac{4(160 - 13a)}{10} = 42 \]
\[ 75a - \frac{640 - 52a}{10} = 42 \]
\[ 75a - 64 + 5.2a = 42 \]
\[ 75a + 5.2a - 64 = 42 \]
\[ 80.2a - 64 = 42 \]

Add 64 to both sides:

\[ 80.2a = 106 \]

Divide by 80.2:

\[ a = \frac{106}{80.2} \]
\[ a \approx 1.32 \]

Now, substitute \( a \approx 1.32 \) back into the expression for \( i \):

\[ i = \frac{160 - 13(1.32)}{10} \]
\[ i = \frac{160 - 17.16}{10} \]
\[ i = \frac{142.84}{10} \]
\[ i \approx 14.28 \]

1. \( 37p + 74c = 183 \)
2. \( 27c - 18p = 13 \)

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 3:

\[ 27c - 18p = 13 \]
\[ 9c - 6p = \frac{13}{3} \]

Now, we have the system:

1. \( 37p + 74c = 183 \)
2. \( 9c - 6p = \frac{13}{3} \)

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the second equation by a factor that will make the coefficients of \( p \) or \( c \) in both equations equal. Let's multiply the second equation by 37 to match the coefficient of \( p \) in the first equation:

\[ 37(9c - 6p) = 37 \left(\frac{13}{3}\right) \]
\[ 333c - 222p = \frac{481}{3} \]

Now, we have:

1. \( 37p + 74c = 183 \)
2. \( 333c - 222p = \frac{481}{3} \)

Next, we multiply the first equation by 6 to match the coefficient of \( p \) in the second equation:

\[ 6(37p + 74c) = 6(183) \]
\[ 222p + 444c = 1098 \]

Now, we have:

1. \( 222p + 444c = 1098 \)
2. \( 333c - 222p = \frac{481}{3} \)

Add the two equations to eliminate \( p \):

\[ 222p + 444c + 333c - 222p = 1098 + \frac{481}{3} \]
\[ 777c = 1098 + \frac{481}{3} \]

Convert 1098 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:

\[ 1098 = \frac{3294}{3} \]

So, we have:

\[ 777c = \frac{3294}{3} + \frac{481}{3} \]
\[ 777c = \frac{3775}{3} \]

Solve for \( c \):

\[ c = \frac{\frac{3775}{3}}{777} \]
\[ c = \frac{3775}{3 \times 777} \]
\[ c = \frac{3775}{2331} \]
\[ c = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, substitute \( c = \frac{5}{3} \) back into the first equation to solve for \( p \):

\[ 37p + 74 \left(\frac{5}{3}\right) = 183 \]
\[ 37p + \frac{370}{3} = 183 \]

Convert 183 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:

\[ 183 = \frac{549}{3} \]

So, we have:

\[ 37p + \frac{370}{3} = \frac{549}{3} \]
\[ 37p = \frac{549}{3} - \frac{370}{3} \]
\[ 37p = \frac{179}{3} \]

Solve for \( p \):

\[ p = \frac{\frac{179}{3}}{37} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{3 \times 37} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]
\[ p = \frac{179}{111} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the values of \( k \) and \( p \) from the given system of equations, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, I will use the elimination method.

The given system of equations is:
\[ 48k - 30p = 37 \quad \text{(1)} \]
\[ 16p + 33k = 105 \quad \text{(2)} \]

First, we will eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate \( p \). To do this, we need to make the coefficients of \( p \) in both equations equal. We can achieve this by multiplying equation (1) by 16 and equation (2) by 30.

Multiplying equation (1) by 16:
\[ 16 \cdot (48k - 30p) = 16 \cdot 37 \]
\[ 768k - 480p = 592 \quad \text{(3)} \]

Multiplying equation (2) by 30:
\[ 30 \cdot (16p + 33k) = 30 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 480p + 990k = 3150 \quad \text{(4)} \]

Now, we add equations (3) and (4) to eliminate \( p \):
\[ 768k - 480p + 480p + 990k = 592 + 3150 \]
\[ 1758k = 3742 \]

Solving for \( k \):
\[ k = \frac{3742}{1758} \]
\[ k = 2.13 \]

Next, we substitute \( k = 2.13 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( p \). Let's use equation (2):
\[ 16p + 33(2.13) = 105 \]
\[ 16p + 70.29 = 105 \]
\[ 16p = 105 - 70.29 \]
\[ 16p = 34.71 \]
\[ p = \frac{34.71}{16} \]
\[ p = 2.17 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method.

The given equations are:
1. \( 75v - 69f = 14 \)
2. \( 46f + 53v = 110 \)

First, we will multiply each equation by a suitable number so that the coefficients of one of the variables are the same (or opposites). Let's eliminate \( f \) by making the coefficients of \( f \) equal.

Multiply the first equation by 46 and the second equation by 69:
\[ 46(75v - 69f) = 46(14) \]
\[ 69(46f + 53v) = 69(110) \]

This gives us:
\[ 3450v - 3174f = 644 \]
\[ 3174f + 3657v = 7590 \]

Now, add the two equations to eliminate \( f \):
\[ 3450v - 3174f + 3174f + 3657v = 644 + 7590 \]
\[ 7107v = 8234 \]

Solve for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{8234}{7107} \]
\[ v = \frac{8234}{7107} \approx 1.159 \]

Now, substitute \( v \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( f \). We use the second equation:
\[ 46f + 53(1.159) = 110 \]
\[ 46f + 61.427 = 110 \]
\[ 46f = 110 - 61.427 \]
\[ 46f = 48.573 \]
\[ f = \frac{48.573}{46} \]
\[ f \approx 1.056 \]

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 10 to align the coefficients of \( o \):

\[ 10(7o + 13g) = 10(131) \]
\[ 70o + 130g = 1310 \]

Now, we have:

1) \( 88d - 60k = 38 \)
2) \( 33k - 11d = 46 \)

First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 11:

\[ 33k - 11d = 46 \]
\[ 3k - d = \frac{46}{11} \]
\[ 3k - d = 4.1818 \]

Now, we have the simplified system:

1) \( 88d - 60k = 38 \)
2) \( 3k - d = 4.1818 \)

Next, we solve the second equation for \( d \):

\[ d = 3k - 4.1818 \]

Substitute this expression for \( d \) into the first equation:

\[ 88(3k - 4.1818) - 60k = 38 \]

Distribute the 88:

\[ 264k - 368.38 - 60k = 38 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 204k - 368.38 = 38 \]

Add 368.38 to both sides:

\[ 204k = 406.38 \]

Divide both sides by 204:

\[ k = \frac{406.38}{204} \]
\[ k = 1.993 \]

1. \( 24z + 72y = 139 \)
2. \( 2z + 82y = 96 \)

First, we can simplify the first equation by dividing all terms by 24:

\[ z + 3y = \frac{139}{24} \]

Next, simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:

\[ z + 41y = 48 \]

Now we have the simplified system:

1. \( z + 3y = \frac{139}{24} \)
2. \( z + 41y = 48 \)

To eliminate \( z \), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (z + 41y) - (z + 3y) = 48 - \frac{139}{24} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 41y - 3y = 48 - \frac{139}{24} \]
\[ 38y = 48 - \frac{139}{24} \]

Convert 48 to a fraction with a denominator of 24:

\[ 48 = \frac{1152}{24} \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ 38y = \frac{1152}{24} - \frac{139}{24} \]
\[ 38y = \frac{1152 - 139}{24} \]
\[ 38y = \frac{1013}{24} \]

Now, solve for \( y \):

\[ y = \frac{1013}{24 \cdot 38} \]
\[ y = \frac{1013}{912} \]
\[ y = \frac{1013}{912} \approx 1.111 \]

Now substitute \( y \approx 1.111 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( z \). Using \( z + 3y = \frac{139}{24} \):

\[ z + 3(1.111) = \frac{139}{24} \]
\[ z + 3.333 = \frac{139}{24} \]

First, let's multiply the second equation by 29 to align the coefficients of \( v \):

\[ 29(8v + 30o) = 29(91) \]
\[ 232v + 870o = 2639 \]

Now, we have the system:

Next, multiply the first equation by 8 to align the coefficients of \( o \):

\[ 696o - 232v = 8 \]

Now, we have the system:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations for \( h \) and \( p \), we start with the given equations:

1. \( 23h - 46p = 58 \)
2. \( 11p + 23h = 124 \)

First, let's isolate one of the variables. Notice that both equations contain the term \( 23h \). We can eliminate \( 23h \) by adding the two equations together.

Adding the two equations:
\[ (23h - 46p) + (11p + 23h) = 58 + 124 \]

Simplify:
\[ 23h + 23h - 46p + 11p = 182 \]
\[ 46h - 35p = 182 \]

Now, we can solve for \( h \) by isolating it. However, let's first simplify the equation by dividing everything by 23:
\[ 2h - \frac{35}{23}p = \frac{182}{23} \]
\[ 2h - \frac{35}{23}p = 7.913 \]

This approach seems cumbersome. Instead, let's solve the second equation for \( 23h \) and substitute it into the first equation.

From the second equation:
\[ 11p + 23h = 124 \]
\[ 23h = 124 - 11p \]

Substitute \( 23h \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 23h - 46p = 58 \]
\[ (124 - 11p) - 46p = 58 \]
\[ 124 - 57p = 58 \]

Now, solve for \( p \):
\[ 124 - 58 = 57p \]
\[ 66 = 57p \]
\[ p = \frac{66}{57} \]
\[ p = \frac{22}{19} \]

Now, substitute \( p = \frac{22}{19} \) back into the second equation to solve for \( h \):
\[ 11p + 23h = 124 \]
\[ 11 \left(\frac{22}{19}\right) + 23h = 124 \]
\[ \frac{242}{19} + 23h = 124 \]

Convert 124 to a fraction with a denominator of 19:
\[ \frac{242}{19} + 23h = \frac{2356}{19} \]

Subtract \( \frac{242}{19} \) from both sides:
\[ 23h = \frac{2356}{19} - \frac{242}{19} \]
\[ 23h = \frac{2114}{19} \]

Divide both sides by 23:
\[ h = \frac{2114}{19 \times 23} \]
\[ h = \frac{2114}{437} \]
\[ h = \frac{2114 \div 2114}{437 \div 2114} \]
\[ h = \frac{1}{\frac{437}{2114}} \]
\[ h = \frac{1}{\frac{437}{2114}} \]
\[ h = \frac{2114}{437} \]
\[ h = 4.84 \]

            If the following system of equations represents the relationship between integers d and f, determine their values:

2) 90d - 42f = 69.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

1) \( 19d + 6f = 120 \)
2) \( 90d - 42f = 69 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use elimination.

First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 3:

\[ 30d - 14f = 23 \]

Now we have the system:

1) \( 19d + 6f = 120 \)
2) \( 30d - 14f = 23 \)

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the first equation by 14 and the second equation by 6 to make the coefficients of \( f \) equal in magnitude:

\[ 14(19d + 6f) = 14(120) \]
\[ 6(30d - 14f) = 6(23) \]

This gives us:

\[ 266d + 84f = 1680 \]
\[ 180d - 84f = 138 \]

Now, add the two equations to eliminate \( f \):

\[ 266d + 84f + 180d - 84f = 1680 + 138 \]
\[ 446d = 1818 \]

Solve for \( d \):

\[ d = \frac{1818}{446} \]
\[ d = 4 \]

Now substitute \( d = 4 \) back into the first original equation to solve for \( f \):

\[ 19(4) + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 76 + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 6f = 120 - 76 \]
\[ 6f = 44 \]
\[ f = \frac{44}{6} \]
\[ f = \frac{22}{3} \]

Since \( f \) must be an integer, we need to recheck our steps. It appears there might be an error in the simplification or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the system:

1) \( 19d + 6f = 120 \)
2) \( 30d - 14f = 23 \)

We should recheck the integer solutions. Let's try another approach by checking possible integer values for \( d \) and solving for \( f \):

For \( d = 4 \):

\[ 19(4) + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 76 + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 6f = 44 \]
\[ f = \frac{44}{6} \]

This confirms \( f \) is not an integer. Let's try another integer value for \( d \):

For \( d = 3 \):

\[ 19(3) + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 57 + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 6f = 63 \]
\[ f = 10.5 \]

This also confirms \( f \) is not an integer. Let's try another integer value for \( d \):

For \( d = 2 \):

\[ 19(2) + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 38 + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 6f = 82 \]
\[ f = \frac{82}{6} \]

This confirms \( f \) is not an integer. Let's try another integer value for \( d \):

For \( d = 1 \):

\[ 19(1) + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 19 + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 6f = 101 \]
\[ f = \frac{101}{6} \]

This confirms \( f \) is not an integer. Let's try another integer value for \( d \):

For \( d = 0 \):

\[ 19(0) + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 6f = 120 \]
\[ f = 20 \]

This confirms \( f \) is an integer. Let's check the second equation:

\[ 30(0) - 14(20) = 23 \]
\[ -280 \neq 23 \]

This confirms \( f \) is not an integer. Let's try another integer value for \( d \):

For \( d = -1 \):

\[ 19(-1) + 6f = 120 \]
\[ -19 + 6f = 120 \]
\[ 6f = 139 \]
\[ f = \frac{139}{6} \]

This confirms \( f \) is not an integer. Let's try another integer value for \( d \):

For \( d = -2 \):

\[ 19(-2) + 6f = 120 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of linear equations:

1) \( 42m + 55r = 127 \)
2) \( 66m - 52r = 44 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, we need to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( m \). To do this, we need to find a common multiple of the coefficients of \( m \) in both equations (42 and 66). The least common multiple (LCM) of 42 and 66 is 462.

We will multiply the first equation by 11 and the second equation by 7 to make the coefficients of \( m \) equal to 462:

\[ 11 \times (42m + 55r) = 11 \times 127 \]
\[ 462m + 605r = 1397 \quad \text{(Equation 3)} \]

\[ 7 \times (66m - 52r) = 7 \times 44 \]
\[ 462m - 364r = 308 \quad \text{(Equation 4)} \]

Next, we subtract Equation 4 from Equation 3 to eliminate \( m \):

\[ (462m + 605r) - (462m - 364r) = 1397 - 308 \]
\[ 462m + 605r - 462m + 364r = 1089 \]
\[ 969r = 1089 \]

Now, solve for \( r \):

\[ r = \frac{1089}{969} \]
\[ r = \frac{1089 \div 21}{969 \div 21} \]
\[ r = \frac{51}{46} \]

Now that we have \( r \), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for \( m \). Let's use the first equation:

\[ 42m + 55r = 127 \]
\[ 42m + 55 \left( \frac{51}{46} \right) = 127 \]
\[ 42m + \frac{55 \times 51}{46} = 127 \]
\[ 42m + \frac{2805}{46} = 127 \]
\[ 42m + 61 = 127 \]
\[ 42m = 127 - 61 \]
\[ 42m = 66 \]
\[ m = \frac{66}{42} \]
\[ m = \frac{66 \div 6}{42 \div 6} \]
\[ m = \frac{11}{7} \]

Thus, the values of \( r \) and \( m \) are:

\[ 57w + 71n = 173 \]

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we will multiply the first equation by 71 and the second equation by 31 to make the coefficients of \( n \) the same:

\[ 71(31n + 64w) = 71 \cdot 120 \]
\[ 31(57w + 71n) = 31 \cdot 173 \]

This gives us:

\[ 2201n + 4544w = 8520 \]
\[ 2201n + 1767w = 5363 \]

Next, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( n \):

\[ (2201n + 4544w) - (2201n + 1767w) = 8520 - 5363 \]
\[ 2777w = 3157 \]

Solving for \( w \):

\[ w = \frac{3157}{2777} \approx 1.137 \]

Now, we substitute \( w \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( n \). Using the first equation:

\[ 31n + 64 \left( \frac{3157}{2777} \right) = 120 \]
\[ 31n + \frac{202048}{2777} = 120 \]
\[ 31n = 120 - \frac{202048}{2777} \]
\[ 31n = \frac{333240 - 202048}{2777} \]
\[ 31n = \frac{131192}{2777} \]
\[ n = \frac{131192}{2777 \cdot 31} \]
\[ n = \frac{131192}{86087} \approx 1.524 \]

Thus, the approximate values of \( n \) and \( w \) that satisfy the system of equations are:

The given system of equations is:
1) \( 72a + 26u = 112 \)
2) \( 76u - 77a = 31 \)

First, let's multiply the first equation by 77 and the second equation by 72 to align the coefficients of \(a\):

\[ 77(72a + 26u) = 77(112) \]
\[ 72(76u - 77a) = 72(31) \]

This gives us:
\[ 5544a + 2002u = 8624 \]
\[ 5472u - 5544a = 2232 \]

Next, we add these two equations to eliminate \(a\):

\[ 5544a + 2002u + 5472u - 5544a = 8624 + 2232 \]
\[ 7474u = 10856 \]

Now, solve for \(u\):

\[ u = \frac{10856}{7474} \]
\[ u = 1.452 \]

Next, substitute \(u = 1.452\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(a\). We'll use the first equation:

\[ 72a + 26(1.452) = 112 \]
\[ 72a + 37.752 = 112 \]
\[ 72a = 112 - 37.752 \]
\[ 72a = 74.248 \]
\[ a = \frac{74.248}{72} \]
\[ a = 1.031 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

1. \( 54n + 18b = 143 \)
2. \( 87n - 93b = 48 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, let's simplify the first equation by dividing all terms by 18:

\[ 54n + 18b = 143 \]
\[ \frac{54n}{18} + \frac{18b}{18} = \frac{143}{18} \]
\[ 3n + b = \frac{143}{18} \]

Next, simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 3:

\[ 87n - 93b = 48 \]
\[ \frac{87n}{3} - \frac{93b}{3} = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ 29n - 31b = 16 \]

Now we have the simplified system of equations:

1. \( 3n + b = \frac{143}{18} \)
2. \( 29n - 31b = 16 \)

To eliminate \( b \), we can multiply the first equation by 31:

\[ 31(3n + b) = 31 \left(\frac{143}{18}\right) \]
\[ 93n + 31b = \frac{4433}{18} \]

Now we have:

1. \( 93n + 31b = \frac{4433}{18} \)
2. \( 29n - 31b = 16 \)

Add these two equations to eliminate \( b \):

\[ (93n + 31b) + (29n - 31b) = \frac{4433}{18} + 16 \]
\[ 122n = \frac{4433}{18} + 16 \]

Convert 16 to a fraction with a denominator of 18:

\[ 16 = \frac{288}{18} \]

So,

\[ 122n = \frac{4433}{18} + \frac{288}{18} \]
\[ 122n = \frac{4721}{18} \]

Solve for \( n \):

\[ n = \frac{4721}{18 \times 122} \]
\[ n = \frac{4721}{2196} \]
\[ n = \frac{4721 \div 1}{2196 \div 1} \]
\[ n = \frac{4721}{2196} \]

This fraction can be simplified further if there is a common factor, but for now, we will leave it as is.

Next, substitute \( n \) back into the simplified first equation to solve for \( b \):

\[ 3n + b = \frac{143}{18} \]
\[ 3 \left(\frac{4721}{2196}\right) + b = \frac{143}{18} \]
\[ \frac{14163}{2196} + b = \frac{143}{18} \]

Convert \(\frac{14163}{2196}\) to a common denominator with \(\frac{143}{18}\):

\[ \frac{14163}{2196} = \frac{14163 \div 122}{2196 \div 122} = \frac{14163}{2196} \]

So,

\[ \frac{14163}{2196} + b = \frac{143}{18} \]

Convert \(\frac{143}{18}\) to a common denominator with \(\frac{14163}{2196}\):

\[ \frac{143}{18} = \frac{143 \times 122}{18 \times 122} = \frac{17426}{2196} \]

So,

\[ \frac{14163}{2196} + b = \frac{17426}{2196} \]

Subtract \(\frac{14163}{2196}\) from both sides:

\[ b = \frac{17426 - 14163}{2196} \]
\[ b = \frac{3263}{2196} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ b = \frac{3263 \div 1}{2196 \div 1} = \frac{3263}{2196} \]

So, the values of \( n \) and \( b \) are:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

\[ 53e + 7p = 103 \]
\[ 69e - 88p = 6 \]

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, we need to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( e \). To do this, we need to find a common multiple of the coefficients of \( e \) in both equations (53 and 69). The least common multiple (LCM) of 53 and 69 is 3657.

We can multiply the first equation by 69 and the second equation by 53 to make the coefficients of \( e \) equal:

\[ 69(53e + 7p) = 69(103) \]
\[ 53(69e - 88p) = 53(6) \]

This gives us:

\[ 3657e + 483p = 7107 \]
\[ 3657e - 4664p = 318 \]

Next, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( e \):

\[ (3657e + 483p) - (3657e - 4664p) = 7107 - 318 \]
\[ 3657e + 483p - 3657e + 4664p = 7107 - 318 \]
\[ 5147p = 6789 \]

Now, solve for \( p \):

\[ p = \frac{6789}{5147} \approx 1.32 \]

Next, substitute \( p \approx 1.32 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( e \). We'll use the first equation:

\[ 53e + 7(1.32) = 103 \]
\[ 53e + 9.24 = 103 \]
\[ 53e = 103 - 9.24 \]
\[ 53e = 93.76 \]
\[ e = \frac{93.76}{53} \approx 1.77 \]

Thus, the costs of electricity and petroleum are approximately:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of linear equations:

1. \((18p - 7s) = 21\)
2. \((51s - 24p) = 14\)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 24 and the second equation by 18 to align the coefficients of \(p\):

\[
24(18p - 7s) = 24 \cdot 21
\]
\[
18(51s - 24p) = 18 \cdot 14
\]

This gives us:

\[
432p - 168s = 504
\]
\[
918s - 432p = 252
\]

Now, add the two equations together to eliminate \(p\):

\[
432p - 168s + 918s - 432p = 504 + 252
\]

Simplify:

\[
750s = 756
\]

Solve for \(s\):

\[
s = \frac{756}{750} = 1.008
\]

Now substitute \(s = 1.008\) back into the first equation to solve for \(p\):

\[
18p - 7(1.008) = 21
\]
\[
18p - 7.056 = 21
\]
\[
18p = 21 + 7.056
\]
\[
18p = 28.056
\]
\[
p = \frac{28.056}{18} = 1.558
\]

Thus, the values of \(p\) and \(s\) that satisfy both equations are:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

1) \( 59c - 34w = 84 \)
2) \( 11c + 42w = 98 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, we need to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( c \). To do this, we need to find a common multiple of the coefficients of \( c \) in both equations, which are 59 and 11. The least common multiple (LCM) of 59 and 11 is \( 59 \times 11 = 649 \).

We will multiply the first equation by 11 and the second equation by 59:

\[
11(59c - 34w) = 11(84)
\]
\[
649c - 374w = 924
\]

\[
59(11c + 42w) = 59(98)
\]
\[
649c + 2478w = 5782
\]

Now we have the system:

\[
649c - 374w = 924
\]
\[
649c + 2478w = 5782
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):

\[
(649c + 2478w) - (649c - 374w) = 5782 - 924
\]
\[
649c + 2478w - 649c + 374w = 4858
\]
\[
2852w = 4858
\]

Solving for \( w \):

\[
w = \frac{4858}{2852}
\]
\[
w = \frac{2429}{1426}
\]
\[
w = 1.7
\]

Now substitute \( w = 1.7 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( c \). We'll use the second equation:

\[
11c + 42(1.7) = 98
\]
\[
11c + 71.4 = 98
\]
\[
11c = 98 - 71.4
\]
\[
11c = 26.6
\]
\[
c = \frac{26.6}{11}
\]
\[
c = 2.418
\]

            Solve the following system of equations for the values of f and z:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

1. \( 45f + 42z = 101 \)
2. \( 60z - 42f = 13 \)

First, let's label the equations for reference:
\[ (1) \quad 45f + 42z = 101 \]
\[ (2) \quad 60z - 42f = 13 \]

We can use the method of elimination to solve for \( f \) and \( z \). First, we will add the two equations to eliminate \( f \).

To do this, we need to align the coefficients of \( f \) and \( z \). Notice that the coefficients of \( f \) in both equations are opposites when multiplied by 1 and -1 respectively. So, we can directly add the equations:

\[ 45f + 42z + 60z - 42f = 101 + 13 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ (45f - 42f) + (42z + 60z) = 114 \]
\[ 3f + 102z = 114 \]

Now, we can solve for \( z \) by isolating it. First, simplify the equation:
\[ 3f + 102z = 114 \]
\[ 102z = 114 - 3f \]
\[ z = \frac{114 - 3f}{102} \]

Next, substitute \( z \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( f \). Let's use equation (1):
\[ 45f + 42\left(\frac{114 - 3f}{102}\right) = 101 \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ 45f + 42 \cdot \frac{114 - 3f}{102} = 101 \]
\[ 45f + \frac{42 \cdot 114 - 42 \cdot 3f}{102} = 101 \]
\[ 45f + \frac{4788 - 126f}{102} = 101 \]

Multiply through by 102 to clear the fraction:
\[ 45f \cdot 102 + 4788 - 126f = 101 \cdot 102 \]
\[ 4590f + 4788 - 126f = 10302 \]
\[ 4464f + 4788 = 10302 \]

Isolate \( f \):
\[ 4464f = 10302 - 4788 \]
\[ 4464f = 5514 \]
\[ f = \frac{5514}{4464} \]
\[ f = \frac{459}{372} \]
\[ f = \frac{153}{124} \]

Now, substitute \( f \) back into the expression for \( z \):
\[ z = \frac{114 - 3 \cdot \frac{153}{124}}{102} \]
\[ z = \frac{114 - \frac{459}{124}}{102} \]
\[ z = \frac{\frac{14136 - 459}{124}}{102} \]
\[ z = \frac{\frac{13677}{124}}{102} \]
\[ z = \frac{13677}{124 \cdot 102} \]
\[ z = \frac{13677}{12648} \]
\[ z = \frac{1139}{1044} \]
\[ z = \frac{1139}{1044} \]

So, the values of \( f \) and \( z \) are:
\[ f = \frac{153}{124} \]
\[ z = \frac{1139}{1044} \]

First, we need to make the coefficients of either \( p \) or \( u \) the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( p \) by finding a common multiple of the coefficients of \( p \) in both equations (26 and 15). The least common multiple of 26 and 15 is 390.

Multiply the first equation by 15 and the second equation by 26:

\[ 15(26p - 21u) = 15(6) \]
\[ 390p - 315u = 90 \]  \(\quad \text{(Equation 3)}\)

\[ 26(15p + 58u) = 26(83) \]
\[ 390p + 1508u = 2158 \]  \(\quad \text{(Equation 4)}\)

Now, subtract Equation 3 from Equation 4 to eliminate \( p \):

\[ (390p + 1508u) - (390p - 315u) = 2158 - 90 \]
\[ 390p + 1508u - 390p + 315u = 2068 \]
\[ 1823u = 2068 \]

Solve for \( u \):

\[ u = \frac{2068}{1823} \]
\[ u = 1.134 \]

Now substitute \( u = 1.134 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( p \). We'll use the first equation:

\[ 26p - 21(1.134) = 6 \]
\[ 26p - 23.814 = 6 \]
\[ 26p = 6 + 23.814 \]
\[ 26p = 29.814 \]
\[ p = \frac{29.814}{26} \]
\[ p = 1.147 \]

First, let's eliminate one of the variables. We can start by making the coefficients of \( s \) in both equations equal. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 38 and 8, which is 152.

Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 19:

\[ 4(92n - 38s) = 4(62) \]
\[ 368n - 152s = 248 \]

\[ 19(59n + 8s) = 19(75) \]
\[ 1121n + 152s = 1425 \]

Now, we have the system:

\[ 368n - 152s = 248 \]
\[ 1121n + 152s = 1425 \]

Add the two equations to eliminate \( s \):

\[ 368n - 152s + 1121n + 152s = 248 + 1425 \]
\[ 1489n = 1673 \]

1) \( 87z - 35e = 63 \)
2) \( 81z + 58e = 154 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we need to make the coefficients of either \( z \) or \( e \) the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( z \) by finding a common multiple of the coefficients of \( z \) in both equations.

The coefficients of \( z \) are 87 and 81. The least common multiple (LCM) of 87 and 81 is 87 * 81 / gcd(87, 81). The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 87 and 81 is 3, so the LCM is:

\[ \text{LCM} = \frac{87 \times 81}{3} = 2349 \]

Now, we will multiply the first equation by 81 and the second equation by 87 to make the coefficients of \( z \) equal to 2349.

Multiplying the first equation by 81:
\[ 81 \times (87z - 35e) = 81 \times 63 \]
\[ 7047z - 2835e = 5103 \]

Multiplying the second equation by 87:
\[ 87 \times (81z + 58e) = 87 \times 154 \]
\[ 7047z + 5046e = 13398 \]

Now, we subtract the first modified equation from the second modified equation to eliminate \( z \):

\[ (7047z + 5046e) - (7047z - 2835e) = 13398 - 5103 \]
\[ 7047z + 5046e - 7047z + 2835e = 8295 \]
\[ 7881e = 8295 \]

Solving for \( e \):
\[ e = \frac{8295}{7881} \]
\[ e = 1.0526 \]

Now, substitute \( e = 1.0526 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( z \). We use the first equation:

\[ 87z - 35(1.0526) = 63 \]
\[ 87z - 36.841 = 63 \]
\[ 87z = 63 + 36.841 \]
\[ 87z = 99.841 \]

Next, simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:

Now, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the substitution method. From Equation 1, solve for \( t \):

            Solve the following system of linear equations to find the values of b and o: ((69 * b) - (50 * o)) = 55
((41 * o) + (18 * b)) = 85.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of linear equations:

1. \((69b - 50o) = 55\)
2. \((41o + 18b) = 85\)

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's align the equations for clarity:

\[
69b - 50o = 55 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]
\[
18b + 41o = 85 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply each equation by a suitable number so that the coefficients of one of the variables are opposites. Let's eliminate \(o\) by making the coefficients of \(o\) in both equations equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Multiply Equation 1 by 41 and Equation 2 by 50:

\[
41(69b - 50o) = 41(55)
\]
\[
50(18b + 41o) = 50(85)
\]

This gives us:

\[
2829b - 2050o = 2255 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]
\[
900b + 2050o = 4250 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Now, add Equation 3 and Equation 4 to eliminate \(o\):

\[
2829b - 2050o + 900b + 2050o = 2255 + 4250
\]

Simplify:

\[
3729b = 6505
\]

Solve for \(b\):

\[
b = \frac{6505}{3729} \approx 1.744
\]

Now, substitute \(b\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(o\). We'll use Equation 2:

\[
18b + 41o = 85
\]

Substitute \(b = 1.744\):

\[
18(1.744) + 41o = 85
\]

Calculate \(18(1.744)\):

\[
31.392 + 41o = 85
\]

Subtract 31.392 from both sides:

\[
41o = 85 - 31.392
\]
\[
41o = 53.608
\]

Solve for \(o\):

\[
o = \frac{53.608}{41} \approx 1.308
\]

Thus, the values of \(b\) and \(o\) are approximately:

2) \( 6q + 5p = 177 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 16 to align the coefficients of \( p \):

\[ 16(6q + 5p) = 16(177) \]
\[ 96q + 80p = 2832 \]

Now we have the system:

1) \( 67q - 80p = 65 \)
2) \( 96q + 80p = 2832 \)

Next, we add these two equations to eliminate \( p \):

\[ (67q - 80p) + (96q + 80p) = 65 + 2832 \]
\[ 163q = 2897 \]

Solving for \( q \):

\[ q = \frac{2897}{163} \]
\[ q = 17.777 \]

Now substitute \( q = 17.777 \) back into the second equation to solve for \( p \):

\[ 6(17.777) + 5p = 177 \]
\[ 106.662 + 5p = 177 \]
\[ 5p = 177 - 106.662 \]
\[ 5p = 70.338 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

1) \( 10k + 48f = 161 \)
2) \( 33k - 41f = 31 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, we need to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( k \). To do this, we need to find a common multiple of the coefficients of \( k \) in both equations (10 and 33). The least common multiple of 10 and 33 is 330.

We will multiply the first equation by 33 and the second equation by 10:

\[ 33(10k + 48f) = 33(161) \]
\[ 10(33k - 41f) = 10(31) \]

This gives us:

\[ 330k + 1584f = 5313 \]
\[ 330k - 410f = 310 \]

Next, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( k \):

\[ (330k + 1584f) - (330k - 410f) = 5313 - 310 \]
\[ 330k + 1584f - 330k + 410f = 5003 \]
\[ 1994f = 5003 \]

Now, solve for \( f \):

\[ f = \frac{5003}{1994} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ f = \frac{5003}{1994} \approx 2.51 \]

Now, substitute \( f \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( k \). We'll use the first equation:

\[ 10k + 48f = 161 \]
\[ 10k + 48 \left( \frac{5003}{1994} \right) = 161 \]

Calculate \( 48 \left( \frac{5003}{1994} \right) \):

\[ 48 \left( \frac{5003}{1994} \right) = \frac{240144}{1994} \approx 120.5 \]

So,

\[ 10k + 120.5 = 161 \]
\[ 10k = 161 - 120.5 \]
\[ 10k = 40.5 \]
\[ k = \frac{40.5}{10} \]
\[ k = 4.05 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations for \( l \) and \( n \), we start with the given equations:

1. \( 31 = 58l - n \)
2. \( 103 = n + 73l \)

First, we can solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve the first equation for \( n \):

\[ 31 = 58l - n \]
\[ n = 58l - 31 \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( n \) into the second equation:

\[ 103 = (58l - 31) + 73l \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 103 = 58l + 73l - 31 \]
\[ 103 = 131l - 31 \]

Add 31 to both sides to isolate the term with \( l \):

\[ 103 + 31 = 131l \]
\[ 134 = 131l \]

Divide both sides by 131 to solve for \( l \):

\[ l = \frac{134}{131} \]
\[ l \approx 1.0229 \]

Now, substitute \( l \approx 1.0229 \) back into the expression for \( n \):

\[ n = 58l - 31 \]
\[ n = 58 \times 1.0229 - 31 \]
\[ n \approx 59.3272 - 31 \]
\[ n \approx 28.3272 \]

Thus, the values of \( l \) and \( n \) are approximately:

First, we need to make the coefficients of either \( y \) or \( j \) the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( y \) by finding a common multiple of the coefficients of \( y \) in both equations.

The coefficients of \( y \) are 29 and 25. The least common multiple (LCM) of 29 and 25 is 725. We will multiply the first equation by 25 and the second equation by 29 to make the coefficients of \( y \) equal to 725.

Multiply the first equation by 25:
\[ 25 \cdot (29y - 28j) = 25 \cdot 39 \]
\[ 725y - 700j = 975 \]

Multiply the second equation by 29:
\[ 29 \cdot (25y + 37j) = 29 \cdot 116 \]
\[ 725y + 1073j = 3364 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ 725y - 700j = 975 \]
\[ 725y + 1073j = 3364 \]

Next, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( y \):
\[ (725y + 1073j) - (725y - 700j) = 3364 - 975 \]
\[ 725y + 1073j - 725y + 700j = 2389 \]
\[ 1773j = 2389 \]

Solve for \( j \):
\[ j = \frac{2389}{1773} \]
\[ j = \frac{2389}{1773} \approx 1.347 \]

Now substitute \( j \approx 1.347 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( y \). We'll use the first equation:
\[ 29y - 28(1.347) = 39 \]
\[ 29y - 37.716 = 39 \]
\[ 29y = 39 + 37.716 \]
\[ 29y = 76.716 \]
\[ y = \frac{76.716}{29} \]
\[ y \approx 2.646 \]

So, the approximate values of \( y \) and \( j \) that satisfy the system of equations are:

First, we need to make the coefficients of either \( u \) or \( a \) the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( u \) by finding a common multiple of the coefficients of \( u \) in both equations.

The coefficients of \( u \) are 93 and 96. The least common multiple (LCM) of 93 and 96 is 8928. We will multiply each equation by the necessary factor to make the coefficients of \( u \) equal to 8928.

Multiply the first equation by 96:
\[ 96 \cdot (93u - 85a) = 96 \cdot 74 \]
\[ 8928u - 8160a = 7104 \]

Multiply the second equation by 93:
\[ 93 \cdot (96u + 17a) = 93 \cdot 186 \]
\[ 8928u + 1581a = 17328 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ 8928u - 8160a = 7104 \]
\[ 8928u + 1581a = 17328 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( u \):
\[ (8928u + 1581a) - (8928u - 8160a) = 17328 - 7104 \]
\[ 8928u + 1581a - 8928u + 8160a = 10224 \]
\[ 9741a = 10224 \]

Solve for \( a \):
\[ a = \frac{10224}{9741} \]
\[ a = \frac{10224}{9741} \approx 1.05 \]

Now substitute \( a \approx 1.05 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( u \). We'll use the second equation:
\[ 96u + 17a = 186 \]
\[ 96u + 17(1.05) = 186 \]
\[ 96u + 17.85 = 186 \]
\[ 96u = 186 - 17.85 \]
\[ 96u = 168.15 \]

First, we need to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( g \). To do this, we need to find a common multiple of the coefficients of \( g \) in both equations, which are 61 and 23. The least common multiple of 61 and 23 is 1403.

We will multiply the first equation by 23 and the second equation by 61:

\[ 23(97u - 61g) = 23(15) \]
\[ 61(85u + 23g) = 61(186) \]

This gives us:

\[ 2231u - 1403g = 345 \]
\[ 5185u + 1403g = 11346 \]

Now, we add these two equations to eliminate \( g \):

\[ (2231u - 1403g) + (5185u + 1403g) = 345 + 11346 \]
\[ 7416u = 11691 \]

Next, solve for \( u \):

\[ u = \frac{11691}{7416} \]
\[ u = \frac{11691 \div 3}{7416 \div 3} \]
\[ u = \frac{3897}{2472} \]
\[ u = \frac{3897 \div 3}{2472 \div 3} \]
\[ u = \frac{1299}{824} \]
\[ u = \frac{1299 \div 1}{824 \div 1} \]
\[ u = 1.575 \]

Now, substitute \( u = 1.575 \) back into one of the original equations to find \( g \). We'll use the second equation:

\[ 85u + 23g = 186 \]
\[ 85(1.575) + 23g = 186 \]
\[ 133.875 + 23g = 186 \]
\[ 23g = 186 - 133.875 \]
\[ 23g = 52.125 \]
\[ g = \frac{52.125}{23} \]
\[ g = 2.265 \]

So, the values of \( u \) and \( g \) are:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use the elimination method.

The given system of equations is:
1) \( 17r + 67b = 103 \)
2) \( 85r + 67b = 187 \)

First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( b \):

\[
(85r + 67b) - (17r + 67b) = 187 - 103
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
85r - 17r = 84
\]

\[
68r = 84
\]

Solving for \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{84}{68} = \frac{42}{34} = \frac{21}{17}
\]

So, \( r = \frac{21}{17} \).

Next, we substitute \( r = \frac{21}{17} \) back into the first equation to solve for \( b \):

\[
17 \left( \frac{21}{17} \right) + 67b = 103
\]

Simplifying the term with \( r \):

\[
21 + 67b = 103
\]

Solving for \( b \):

\[
67b = 103 - 21
\]

\[
67b = 82
\]

\[
b = \frac{82}{67} = \frac{82}{67}
\]

So, \( b = \frac{82}{67} \).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

1. \( 85n - 54t = 41 \)
2. \( 38t + 30n = 126 \)

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's align the equations for clarity:

\[
\begin{align*}
85n - 54t &amp;= 41 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
38t + 30n &amp;= 126 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\end{align*}
\]

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the equations by suitable numbers so that the coefficients of one of the variables are the same (or opposites). Let's eliminate \( t \) by making the coefficients of \( t \) in both equations equal.

Multiply Equation 1 by 38 and Equation 2 by 54:

\[
\begin{align*}
38(85n - 54t) &amp;= 38 \cdot 41 \\
54(38t + 30n) &amp;= 54 \cdot 126
\end{align*}
\]

This gives us:

\[
\begin{align*}
3230n - 2052t &amp;= 1558 \quad \text{(Equation 3)} \\
2052t + 1620n &amp;= 6804 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\end{align*}
\]

Now, add Equation 3 and Equation 4 to eliminate \( t \):

\[
3230n - 2052t + 2052t + 1620n = 1558 + 6804
\]

Simplify:

\[
4850n = 8362
\]

Solve for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{8362}{4850} = \frac{4181}{2425}
\]

Next, substitute \( n = \frac{4181}{2425} \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( t \). We'll use Equation 2:

\[
38t + 30 \left( \frac{4181}{2425} \right) = 126
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
38t + \frac{125430}{2425} = 126
\]

Convert the fraction to a decimal for easier calculation:

\[
38t + 51.7 = 126
\]

Subtract 51.7 from both sides:

\[
38t = 74.3
\]

Solve for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{74.3}{38} = 1.955
\]

Thus, the values of \( t \) and \( n \) are:

\[
t = 1.955, \quad n = \frac{4181}{2425}
\]

1) \( 75u - 69q = 5 \)
2) \( 48u + 25q = 140 \)

We will use the method of elimination to solve for \( u \) and \( q \). First, we need to eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate \( q \).

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 25 and the second equation by 69 to make the coefficients of \( q \) the same:

\[ 25(75u - 69q) = 25 \cdot 5 \]
\[ 1875u - 1725q = 125 \]

\[ 69(48u + 25q) = 69 \cdot 140 \]
\[ 3312u + 1725q = 9660 \]

Step 2: Add the two resulting equations to eliminate \( q \):

\[ 1875u - 1725q + 3312u + 1725q = 125 + 9660 \]
\[ 5187u = 9785 \]

Step 3: Solve for \( u \):

\[ u = \frac{9785}{5187} \]
\[ u = 1.886 \]

Step 4: Substitute \( u = 1.886 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( q \). We use the second equation:

\[ 48(1.886) + 25q = 140 \]
\[ 90.528 + 25q = 140 \]
\[ 25q = 140 - 90.528 \]
\[ 25q = 49.472 \]

\[ q = 1.979 \]

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 49 and the second equation by 20 to align the coefficients of \( v \):

\[
49(20v + 17x) = 49(149)
\]
\[
20(24x - 49v) = 20(22)
\]

This gives us:

\[
980v + 833x = 7301
\]
\[
480x - 980v = 440
\]

Next, we add these two equations to eliminate \( v \):

\[
980v + 833x + 480x - 980v = 7301 + 440

Simplifying, we get:

\[
1313x = 7741

Solving for \( x \):

\[

Now, substitute \( x = 5.9 \) back into the first equation to solve for \( v \):

\[

We can multiply the first equation by 94 and the second equation by 39 to make the coefficients of \( t \) the same:

\[ 94(39t + 41g) = 94(147) \]
\[ 39(94t - 91g) = 39(42) \]

This gives us:

\[ 3666t + 3854g = 13818 \]
\[ 3666t - 3549g = 1638 \]

Next, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( t \):

First, let's eliminate one of the variables. We can multiply the first equation by 55 and the second equation by 6 to make the coefficients of \( c \) the same:

\[
55(6c + 55o) = 55(112)

This gives us:

Next, subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( c \):

\[ 71(8w + 68u) = 71(170) \]
\[ 8(71w - 94u) = 8(8) \]

This gives us:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

\[ 68r + 8f = 92 \]
\[ 97f + 38r = 182 \]

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 38 and the second equation by 68 to make the coefficients of \( r \) the same:

\[ 38(68r + 8f) = 38(92) \]
\[ 68(97f + 38r) = 68(182) \]

This gives us:

\[ 2584r + 304f = 3496 \]
\[ 2584r + 6596f = 12376 \]

Next, we subtract the first new equation from the second new equation to eliminate \( r \):

\[ (2584r + 6596f) - (2584r + 304f) = 12376 - 3496 \]
\[ 6292f = 8880 \]

Now, solve for \( f \):

\[ f = \frac{8880}{6292} \]
\[ f = \frac{4440}{3146} \]
\[ f = \frac{2220}{1573} \]
\[ f \approx 1.41 \]

Now, substitute \( f \approx 1.41 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( r \). We'll use the first equation:

\[ 68r + 8(1.41) = 92 \]
\[ 68r + 11.28 = 92 \]
\[ 68r = 92 - 11.28 \]
\[ 68r = 80.72 \]
\[ r = \frac{80.72}{68} \]
\[ r \approx 1.19 \]

So, the approximate values of \( r \) and \( f \) are:

            Given the equations below, find the values of r and d:

For the first equation, consider 67 apples, each worth d dollars, and 37 ragdolls, each worth r dollars. If the total value of all these items is $50, you can represent this situation with the equation 67d - 37r = 50.

In another case, consider 39 ragdolls, each worth r dollars, and 21 apples, each worth d dollars. If the total value of all these items is $16, you can also represent this situation with the equation 39r - 21d = 16.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve for \( d \) and \( r \), we start with the given system of linear equations:

1. \( 67d - 37r = 50 \)
2. \( 39r - 21d = 16 \)

We will use the method of elimination to solve this system. First, we need to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( d \) by finding a common multiple of the coefficients of \( d \) in both equations.

The coefficients of \( d \) are 67 and 21. The least common multiple (LCM) of 67 and 21 is 1407. We will multiply the first equation by 21 and the second equation by 67 to make the coefficients of \( d \) equal to 1407.

Multiplying the first equation by 21:
\[ 21 \times 67d - 21 \times 37r = 21 \times 50 \]
\[ 1407d - 777r = 1050 \]

Multiplying the second equation by 67:
\[ 67 \times 39r - 67 \times 21d = 67 \times 16 \]
\[ 2613r - 1407d = 1072 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ 1407d - 777r = 1050 \]
\[ -1407d + 2613r = 1072 \]

Adding these two equations will eliminate \( d \):
\[ (1407d - 777r) + (-1407d + 2613r) = 1050 + 1072 \]
\[ 0d + 1836r = 2122 \]
\[ 1836r = 2122 \]
\[ r = \frac{2122}{1836} \]
\[ r = \frac{1061}{918} \]
\[ r = \frac{1061}{918} \approx 1.155 \]

Now, substitute \( r \approx 1.155 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( d \). We use the second equation:
\[ 39r - 21d = 16 \]
\[ 39(1.155) - 21d = 16 \]
\[ 45.045 - 21d = 16 \]
\[ -21d = 16 - 45.045 \]
\[ -21d = -29.045 \]
\[ d = \frac{-29.045}{-21} \]
\[ d \approx 1.383 \]

Thus, the values of \( d \) and \( r \) are approximately:
\[ d \approx 1.383 \]
\[ r \approx 1.155 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of simultaneous linear equations, we start by writing down the equations:

1. \( 163 = 50x + a \)
2. \( 24 = 98x - 84a \)

First, we solve the first equation for \( a \):

\[ 163 = 50x + a \]
\[ a = 163 - 50x \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( a \) into the second equation:

\[ 24 = 98x - 84(163 - 50x) \]

Now, distribute the \(-84\) in the second equation:

\[ 24 = 98x - 84 \cdot 163 + 84 \cdot 50x \]
\[ 24 = 98x - 13716 + 4200x \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 24 = 4298x - 13716 \]

Add 13716 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 24 + 13716 = 4298x \]
\[ 13740 = 4298x \]

Divide both sides by 4298 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{13740}{4298} \]
\[ x \approx 3.196 \]

Now, substitute \( x \approx 3.196 \) back into the expression for \( a \):

\[ a = 163 - 50(3.196) \]
\[ a = 163 - 159.8 \]
\[ a \approx 3.2 \]

Thus, the values of \( x \) and \( a \) are approximately:

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 44 and the second equation by 67 to align the coefficients of \( p \):

\[ 44(67p + 18b) = 44(110) \]
\[ 67(82b - 44p) = 67(58) \]

This gives us:

\[ 2948p + 792b = 4840 \]
\[ 5494b - 2948p = 3886 \]

Now, add the two equations to eliminate \( p \):

\[ 2948p + 792b + 5494b - 2948p = 4840 + 3886 \]
\[ 6286b = 8726 \]

Solve for \( b \):

\[ b = \frac{8726}{6286} \]
\[ b = 1.388 \]

1) \( 63c - 36e = 27 \)
2) \( 8c + 32e = 69 \)

First, we simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 8:

\[ c + 4e = \frac{69}{8} \]

Since \(\frac{69}{8}\) is not an integer, let's keep the equations as they are and use the elimination method.

We can multiply the second equation by 4 to align the coefficients of \(e\):

\[ 4(8c + 32e) = 4(69) \]
\[ 32c + 128e = 276 \]

Now we have the system:

1) \( 63c - 36e = 27 \)
2) \( 32c + 128e = 276 \)

Next, we multiply the first equation by 4 to align the coefficients of \(e\):

\[ 4(63c - 36e) = 4(27) \]
\[ 252c - 144e = 108 \]

Now we have:

1) \( 252c - 144e = 108 \)
2) \( 32c + 128e = 276 \)

To eliminate \(e\), we add the two equations:

\[ 252c - 144e + 32c + 128e = 108 + 276 \]
\[ 284c - 16e = 384 \]

Next, we solve for \(c\):

\[ 284c = 384 + 16e \]
\[ c = \frac{384 + 16e}{284} \]

To find \(e\), we substitute \(c\) back into one of the original equations. Let's use the simplified second equation:

\[ 8c + 32e = 69 \]

Substitute \(c\):

\[ 8\left(\frac{384 + 16e}{284}\right) + 32e = 69 \]
\[ \frac{3072 + 128e}{284} + 32e = 69 \]

Multiply through by 284 to clear the fraction:

\[ 3072 + 128e + 284(32e) = 69 \times 284 \]
\[ 3072 + 128e + 9088e = 19596 \]
\[ 3072 + 9216e = 19596 \]
\[ 9216e = 19596 - 3072 \]
\[ 9216e = 16524 \]
\[ e = \frac{16524}{9216} \]
\[ e = 1.792 \]

Now substitute \(e\) back into the equation for \(c\):

\[ c = \frac{384 + 16(1.792)}{284} \]
\[ c = \frac{384 + 28.672}{284} \]
\[ c = \frac{412.672}{284} \]

First, we need to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( p \). To do this, we need to find a common multiple of the coefficients of \( p \) in both equations (29 and 51). The least common multiple (LCM) of 29 and 51 is 1479.

We will multiply the first equation by 51 and the second equation by 29 to make the coefficients of \( p \) the same:

\[ 51(26x + 29p) = 51(107) \]
\[ 29(61x - 51p) = 29(4) \]

This gives us:

\[ 1326x + 1479p = 5457 \]
\[ 1769x - 1479p = 116 \]

Now, we add these two equations to eliminate \( p \):

\[ 1326x + 1769x = 5573 \]
\[ 3095x = 5573 \]

1. \( 29l + 17g = 68 \)
2. \( 31g - 10l = 17 \)

First, let's solve one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other. We'll solve the first equation for \( l \):

\[ 29l + 17g = 68 \]
\[ 29l = 68 - 17g \]
\[ l = \frac{68 - 17g}{29} \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( l \) into the second equation:

\[ 31g - 10\left(\frac{68 - 17g}{29}\right) = 17 \]

To clear the fraction, multiply every term by 29:

\[ 31g \cdot 29 - 10(68 - 17g) = 17 \cdot 29 \]
\[ 899g - 680 + 170g = 493 \]
\[ 899g + 170g - 680 = 493 \]
\[ 1069g - 680 = 493 \]
\[ 1069g = 1173 \]
\[ g = \frac{1173}{1069} \]
\[ g = 1.097 \]

Now, substitute \( g = 1.097 \) back into the expression for \( l \):

\[ l = \frac{68 - 17(1.097)}{29} \]
\[ l = \frac{68 - 18.649}{29} \]

The coefficients of \(a\) are 33 and 24. The LCM of 33 and 24 is 264.

Next, we will multiply each equation by a factor that will make the coefficients of \(a\) equal to 264.

Multiply equation (1) by 8:
\[ 8 \cdot (33a - 54c) = 8 \cdot 20 \]
\[ 264a - 432c = 160 \quad \text{(3)} \]

Multiply equation (2) by 11:
\[ 11 \cdot (24a - 26c) = 11 \cdot 29 \]
\[ 264a - 286c = 319 \quad \text{(4)} \]

Now, we subtract equation (4) from equation (3) to eliminate \(a\):
\[ (264a - 432c) - (264a - 286c) = 160 - 319 \]
\[ 264a - 432c - 264a + 286c = 160 - 319 \]
\[ -432c + 286c = -159 \]
\[ -146c = -159 \]
\[ c = \frac{-159}{-146} \]
\[ c = \frac{159}{146} \]
\[ c = \frac{159}{146} = \frac{159 \div 3}{146 \div 3} = \frac{53}{48} \]

Now that we have \(c\), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for \(a\). We will use equation (2):
\[ 24a - 26c = 29 \]
\[ 24a - 26 \left(\frac{53}{48}\right) = 29 \]
\[ 24a - \frac{26 \cdot 53}{48} = 29 \]
\[ 24a - \frac{1378}{48} = 29 \]
\[ 24a - 28.7083 = 29 \]
\[ 24a = 29 + 28.7083 \]
\[ 24a = 57.7083 \]
\[ a = \frac{57.7083}{24} \]
\[ a = 2.4045 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, I'll use the elimination method.

First, let's write down the system of equations:
\[ 71d + 9j = 132 \quad \text{(1)} \]
\[ 43j - 84d = 91 \quad \text{(2)} \]

To eliminate one of the variables, we need to make the coefficients of either \(d\) or \(j\) the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \(d\) by finding a common multiple of the coefficients of \(d\) in both equations.

The coefficients of \(d\) are 71 and -84. The least common multiple (LCM) of 71 and 84 is 71 * 84 (since 71 is a prime number and does not divide 84).

Multiply equation (1) by 84:
\[ 84 \cdot (71d + 9j) = 84 \cdot 132 \]
\[ 5964d + 756j = 11088 \quad \text{(3)} \]

Multiply equation (2) by 71:
\[ 71 \cdot (43j - 84d) = 71 \cdot 91 \]
\[ 3053j - 5964d = 6461 \quad \text{(4)} \]

Now, add equations (3) and (4) to eliminate \(d\):
\[ 5964d + 756j + 3053j - 5964d = 11088 + 6461 \]
\[ 756j + 3053j = 17549 \]
\[ 3809j = 17549 \]

Solve for \(j\):
\[ j = \frac{17549}{3809} \]
\[ j = 4.61 \]

Now substitute \(j = 4.61\) back into equation (1) to solve for \(d\):
\[ 71d + 9(4.61) = 132 \]
\[ 71d + 41.49 = 132 \]
\[ 71d = 132 - 41.49 \]
\[ 71d = 90.51 \]
\[ d = \frac{90.51}{71} \]
\[ d = 1.275 \]

\[
\begin{cases}
81o + 26n = 163 \\
87n + 23o = 143
\end{cases}
\]

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 23 and the second equation by 81 to align the coefficients of \(o\):

\[
23(81o + 26n) = 23 \cdot 163
\]
\[
81(87n + 23o) = 81 \cdot 143
\]

This gives us:

\[
1863o + 598n = 3749
\]
\[
1863o + 7047n = 11601
\]

Next, we subtract the first new equation from the second new equation to eliminate \(o\):

\[
1863o + 7047n - (1863o + 598n) = 11601 - 3749
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
(7047n - 598n) = 7852
\]
\[
6450n = 7852
\]

Solving for \(n\):

\[
n = \frac{7852}{6450} = \frac{3926}{3225} = \frac{2}{1.645} \approx 1.21
\]

Now, substitute \(n\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(o\). Using the first equation:

\[
81o + 26(1.21) = 163
\]
\[
81o + 31.46 = 163
\]
\[
81o = 163 - 31.46
\]
\[
81o = 131.54
\]
\[
o = \frac{131.54}{81} \approx 1.62

Thus, the values of \(o\) and \(n\) are approximately:

The given system of equations is:
\[ 46s - 61w = 2 \quad \text{(1)} \]
\[ 61s + 67w = 178 \quad \text{(2)} \]

First, we will eliminate one of the variables by making the coefficients of \( w \) in both equations equal. We can do this by multiplying equation (1) by 67 and equation (2) by 61:

\[ 67(46s - 61w) = 67 \cdot 2 \]
\[ 61(61s + 67w) = 61 \cdot 178 \]

This gives us:
\[ 3082s - 4087w = 134 \quad \text{(3)} \]
\[ 3721s + 4087w = 10858 \quad \text{(4)} \]

Next, we add equations (3) and (4) to eliminate \( w \):

\[ (3082s - 4087w) + (3721s + 4087w) = 134 + 10858 \]
\[ 3082s + 3721s = 10992 \]
\[ 6803s = 10992 \]

Solving for \( s \):
\[ s = \frac{10992}{6803} \]
\[ s = 1.616 \]

Now, substitute \( s = 1.616 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( w \). We'll use equation (1):

\[ 46(1.616) - 61w = 2 \]
\[ 74.336 - 61w = 2 \]
\[ -61w = 2 - 74.336 \]
\[ -61w = -72.336 \]
\[ w = \frac{-72.336}{-61} \]

1) \( 51k - 8i = 86 \)
2) \( 39i + 8k = 193 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's eliminate one of the variables. We can multiply the first equation by 39 and the second equation by 51 to make the coefficients of \(i\) the same:

\[
39(51k - 8i) = 39(86)
\]
\[
51(39i + 8k) = 51(193)
\]

This gives us:

\[
1989k - 312i = 3354
\]
\[
1989i + 408k = 9843
\]

Now, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \(i\):

\[
1989i + 408k - (1989k - 312i) = 9843 - 3354
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
1989i + 408k - 1989k + 312i = 6489
\]
\[
2301i - 1581k = 6489

Now, we solve for \(i\):

\[
2301i = 6489 + 1581k
\]
\[
i = \frac{6489 + 1581k}{2301}
\]

Next, we substitute this value of \(i\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(k\). Let's use the first equation:

\[
51k - 8\left(\frac{6489 + 1581k}{2301}\right) = 86
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
51k - \frac{8(6489 + 1581k)}{2301} = 86
\]
\[
51k - \frac{51912 + 12648k}{2301} = 86
\]

Multiply through by 2301 to clear the fraction:

\[
2301(51k) - 51912 - 12648k = 2301(86)
\]
\[
117351k - 51912 - 12648k = 197886
\]
\[
104703k - 51912 = 197886

\[
104703k = 249798
\]
\[
k = \frac{249798}{104703}

\[
k = 2.385

Now, substitute \(k\) back into the expression for \(i\):

\[
i = \frac{6489 + 1581(2.385)}{2301}
\]
\[
i = \frac{6489 + 3769.485}{2301}

\[
i = \frac{10258.485}{2301}

\[
i = 4.46

\[ 17(93m + l) = 17(126) \]
\[ 1581m + 17l = 2142 \]

Now we have the system:

\[ 26m + 17l = 146 \]
\[ 1581m + 17l = 2142 \]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( l \):

\[ 1581m - 26m = 1996 \]
\[ 1555m = 1996 \]

Now, solve for \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{1996}{1555} \]
\[ m = \frac{4}{3} \]

With \( m \) found, substitute \( m = \frac{4}{3} \) back into the second original equation to solve for \( l \):

1) \( 8f + 39h = 66 \)
2) \( 29f + 46h = 119 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, we need to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( f \). To do this, we need to find a common multiple of the coefficients of \( f \) in both equations (8 and 29). The least common multiple of 8 and 29 is 232.

We will multiply the first equation by 29 and the second equation by 8:

\[
29(8f + 39h) = 29(66)
\]
\[
8(29f + 46h) = 8(119)
\]

This gives us:

\[
232f + 1131h = 1914 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]
\[
232f + 368h = 952 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Next, we subtract Equation 4 from Equation 3 to eliminate \( f \):

\[
(232f + 1131h) - (232f + 368h) = 1914 - 952
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
763h = 962
\]

Solving for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{962}{763} = \frac{962}{763} \approx 1.26
\]

Now, substitute \( h \approx 1.26 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( f \). We'll use the first equation:

\[
8f + 39(1.26) = 66
\]

\[
8f + 49.14 = 66
\]

Subtract 49.14 from both sides:

\[
8f = 66 - 49.14
\]

\[
8f = 16.86

Solving for \( f \):

\[
f = \frac{16.86}{8} \approx 2.11
\]

Thus, the values of \( h \) and \( f \) are approximately:

First, let's multiply the first equation by 69 and the second equation by 22 to align the coefficients of \( b \):

\[
69(22b + 23k) = 69 \cdot 109

22b + 23(2.65) = 109
\]

\[
22b + 60.95 = 109
\]

\[
22b = 109 - 60.95
\]

\[
22b = 48.05
\]

\[
b = \frac{48.05}{22} = 2.185
\]

Thus, the values of \( k \) and \( b \) that satisfy the system of equations are:

1. \( 84m - 55s = 1 \)
2. \( 63m - 2s = 98 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 55 to align the coefficients of \( s \):

\[ 55 \times (63m - 2s) = 55 \times 98 \]
\[ 3465m - 110s = 5390 \]

Next, multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( s \):

\[ 2 \times (84m - 55s) = 2 \times 1 \]
\[ 168m - 110s = 2 \]

Now we have the system:

\[ 3465m - 110s = 5390 \]
\[ 168m - 110s = 2 \]

Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( s \):

\[ (3465m - 110s) - (168m - 110s) = 5390 - 2 \]
\[ 3465m - 168m = 5388 \]
\[ 3297m = 5388 \]

Solve for \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{5388}{3297} \]
\[ m = \frac{5388 \div 3}{3297 \div 3} \]
\[ m = \frac{1796}{1099} \]

Now, substitute \( m = \frac{1796}{1099} \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( s \). We'll use the second equation:

\[ 63m - 2s = 98 \]
\[ 63 \left( \frac{1796}{1099} \right) - 2s = 98 \]
\[ \frac{63 \times 1796}{1099} - 2s = 98 \]
\[ \frac{113148}{1099} - 2s = 98 \]
\[ 102.9 - 2s = 98 \]
\[ -2s = 98 - 102.9 \]
\[ -2s = -4.9 \]
\[ s = \frac{-4.9}{-2} \]
\[ s = 2.45 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we will use the method of substitution or elimination. Here are the given equations:

1. \( 6b + 5k = 105 \)
2. \( 95k - 51b = 67 \)

First, let's solve the first equation for \( b \):

\[ 6b + 5k = 105 \]
\[ 6b = 105 - 5k \]
\[ b = \frac{105 - 5k}{6} \]

Now, substitute this expression for \( b \) into the second equation:

\[ 95k - 51\left(\frac{105 - 5k}{6}\right) = 67 \]

To clear the fraction, multiply every term by 6:

\[ 6 \cdot 95k - 51(105 - 5k) = 67 \cdot 6 \]
\[ 570k - 51 \cdot 105 + 255k = 402 \]
\[ 570k + 255k - 5355 = 402 \]
\[ 825k - 5355 = 402 \]

Add 5355 to both sides:

\[ 825k = 5757 \]

Divide both sides by 825:

\[ k = \frac{5757}{825} \]
\[ k = 6.98 \]

Now, substitute \( k = 6.98 \) back into the expression for \( b \):

\[ b = \frac{105 - 5 \cdot 6.98}{6} \]
\[ b = \frac{105 - 34.9}{6} \]
\[ b = \frac{70.1}{6} \]
\[ b = 11.68 \]

So, the values of \( b \) and \( k \) are approximately:

            <span class="response-field">GPT-4o:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the simultaneous linear equations:

1. \( 33d + 62u = 114 \)
2. \( 32u + 40d = 83 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's align the equations for clarity:

\[
\begin{aligned}
33d + 62u &amp;= 114 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
40d + 32u &amp;= 83 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\end{aligned}
\]

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply each equation by a suitable number so that the coefficients of one of the variables are the same. Let's eliminate \(d\) by making the coefficients of \(d\) in both equations equal.

Multiply Equation 1 by 40 and Equation 2 by 33:

\[
\begin{aligned}
40(33d + 62u) &amp;= 40(114) \\
33(40d + 32u) &amp;= 33(83)
\end{aligned}
\]

This gives us:

\[
\begin{aligned}
1320d + 2480u &amp;= 4560 \quad \text{(Equation 3)} \\
1320d + 1056u &amp;= 2739 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\end{aligned}
\]

Next, subtract Equation 4 from Equation 3 to eliminate \(d\):

\[
(1320d + 2480u) - (1320d + 1056u) = 4560 - 2739
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
1424u = 1821
\]

Solving for \(u\):

\[
u = \frac{1821}{1424} \approx 1.278
\]

Now, substitute \(u\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(d\). We'll use Equation 1:

\[
33d + 62(1.278) = 114
\]

Calculate \(62 \times 1.278\):

\[
33d + 79.236 = 114
\]

Subtract 79.236 from both sides:

\[
33d = 34.764
\]

Solving for \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{34.764}{33} \approx 1.053
\]

Thus, the values of \(d\) and \(u\) are approximately:

\[
d \approx 1.053, \quad u \approx 1.278
\]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations, we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method.

The given system of equations is:
\[ 5c + 28p = 102 \quad \text{(1)} \]
\[ 20c - 67p = 13 \quad \text{(2)} \]

First, we will eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate \( c \). To do this, we need to make the coefficients of \( c \) in both equations the same. We can achieve this by multiplying equation (1) by 4:

\[ 4 \times (5c + 28p) = 4 \times 102 \]
\[ 20c + 112p = 408 \quad \text{(3)} \]

Now we have:
\[ 20c + 112p = 408 \quad \text{(3)} \]
\[ 20c - 67p = 13 \quad \text{(2)} \]

Next, we subtract equation (2) from equation (3):

\[ (20c + 112p) - (20c - 67p) = 408 - 13 \]
\[ 20c + 112p - 20c + 67p = 395 \]
\[ 179p = 395 \]

Now, solve for \( p \):

\[ p = \frac{395}{179} \]
\[ p = \frac{395}{179} \approx 2.21 \]

Now that we have \( p \), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find \( c \). Let's use equation (1):

\[ 5c + 28p = 102 \]
\[ 5c + 28 \left( \frac{395}{179} \right) = 102 \]
\[ 5c + \frac{28 \times 395}{179} = 102 \]
\[ 5c + \frac{11060}{179} = 102 \]
\[ 5c + 61.79 \approx 102 \]
\[ 5c \approx 102 - 61.79 \]
\[ 5c \approx 40.21 \]
\[ c \approx \frac{40.21}{5} \]
\[ c \approx 8.04 \]

First, we will multiply the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 58 to make the coefficients of \( r \) in both equations equal in magnitude:

\[
76 \cdot (58r + 12q) = 76 \cdot 147
\]
\[
58 \cdot (97q - 76r) = 58 \cdot 76

This gives us:

\[
4408r + 912q = 11172

\[
5626q - 4408r = 4408

Next, we add these two equations to eliminate \( r \):

\[
4408r + 912q + 5626q - 4408r = 11172 + 4408

Simplifying, we get:

Now, substitute \( q = 2.38 \) back into the first equation to solve for \( r \):

\[

\[

First, we will eliminate one of the variables by making the coefficients of \( k \) in both equations equal. We can achieve this by multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3:

\[ 2(47v - 3k) = 2(10) \]
\[ 3(73v + 2k) = 3(128) \]

This gives us:

First, let's multiply the first equation by 91 and the second equation by 41 to make the coefficients of \( q \) in both equations equal in magnitude:

\[ 91(89p - 41q) = 91(60) \]
\[ 41(27p + 91q) = 41(124) \]

This gives us:

\[ 8099p - 3731q = 5460 \]

Now, we add these two equations to eliminate \( q \):

First, let's multiply the second equation by a factor that will allow us to eliminate one of the variables when we add or subtract the equations. We can multiply the second equation by 8 to align the coefficients of \(d\):

\[ 8 \times (27u + 36d) = 8 \times 71 \]
\[ 216u + 288d = 568 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( 88u - 96d = 12 \)
2. \( 216u + 288d = 568 \)

Next, we need to align the coefficients of \(u\) or \(d\). Let's align the coefficients of \(u\). We can multiply the first equation by 3:

\[ 3 \times (88u - 96d) = 3 \times 12 \]
\[ 264u - 288d = 36 \]

Now we have:
1. \( 264u - 288d = 36 \)
2. \( 216u + 288d = 568 \)

Add the two equations to eliminate \(d\):

\[ (264u - 288d) + (216u + 288d) = 36 + 568 \]
\[ 480u = 604 \]

Solve for \(u\):

\[ u = \frac{604}{480} \]
\[ u = \frac{151}{120} \]
\[ u = 1.2583 \]

Now substitute \(u = 1.2583\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(d\). Using the first equation:

\[ 88(1.2583) - 96d = 12 \]
\[ 110.7304 - 96d = 12 \]
\[ -96d = 12 - 110.7304 \]
\[ -96d = -98.7304 \]
\[ d = \frac{-98.7304}{-96} \]
\[ d = 1.0284 \]

1. \( 20n - 18f = 9 \)
2. \( 3n - 2f = 70 \)

We can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 6 to align the coefficients of \( n \):

\[ 6(3n - 2f) = 6(70) \]
\[ 18n - 12f = 420 \]

Now we have the system:

1. \( 20n - 18f = 9 \)
2. \( 18n - 12f = 420 \)

Next, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( n \):

\[ (20n - 18f) - (18n - 12f) = 9 - 420 \]
\[ 20n - 18f - 18n + 12f = 9 - 420 \]
\[ 2n - 6f = -411 \]

Simplify this equation:

\[ n - 3f = -205.5 \]

Now, we solve for \( n \):

\[ n = 3f - 205.5 \]

Substitute \( n = 3f - 205.5 \) into the second original equation:

\[ 3(3f - 205.5) - 2f = 70 \]
\[ 9f - 616.5 - 2f = 70 \]
\[ 7f - 616.5 = 70 \]
\[ 7f = 686.5 \]
\[ f = 98 \]

Now substitute \( f = 98 \) back into \( n = 3f - 205.5 \):

\[ n = 3(98) - 205.5 \]
\[ n = 294 - 205.5 \]
\[ n = 88.5 \]

1) \( 7l + 97j = 133 \)
2) \( 22j + 37l = 76 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, we need to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( l \). To do this, we need to find a common multiple of the coefficients of \( l \) in both equations (7 and 37). The least common multiple of 7 and 37 is 259.

Multiply the first equation by 37 and the second equation by 7:

\[
37(7l + 97j) = 37(133)
\]
\[
7(22j + 37l) = 7(76)
\]

This gives us:

\[
259l + 3589j = 4921
\]
\[
154j + 259l = 532
\]

Now, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate \( l \):

\[
(259l + 3589j) - (259l + 154j) = 4921 - 532
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3435j = 4389
\]

Solving for \( j \):

\[
j = \frac{4389}{3435} = \frac{4389 \div 3}{3435 \div 3} = \frac{1463}{1145}
\]

Simplify further:

\[
j = \frac{1463}{1145} = 1.277
\]

Now substitute \( j \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( l \). Using the first equation:

\[
7l + 97(1.277) = 133
\]

\[
7l + 123.869 = 133
\]

\[
7l = 133 - 123.869
\]

\[
7l = 9.131
\]

\[
l = \frac{9.131}{7} = 1.304
\]

So, the values of \( j \) and \( l \) are approximately:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

\[ 21d - 46f = 53 \]
\[ 8d + 84f = 133 \]

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we will multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 21 to make the coefficients of \(d\) the same:

\[ 4(21d - 46f) = 4(53) \]
\[ 84d - 184f = 212 \]

\[ 21(8d + 84f) = 21(133) \]
\[ 168d + 1764f = 2793 \]

Now, we subtract the first modified equation from the second modified equation to eliminate \(d\):

\[ (168d + 1764f) - (84d - 184f) = 2793 - 212 \]
\[ 168d + 1764f - 84d + 184f = 2793 - 212 \]
\[ 84d + 1948f = 2581 \]

Next, we solve for \(f\):

\[ 1948f = 2581 - 84d \]
\[ f = \frac{2581 - 84d}{1948} \]

Now, we substitute \(f\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(d\). Let's use the first equation:

\[ 21d - 46\left(\frac{2581 - 84d}{1948}\right) = 53 \]

Multiply through by 1948 to clear the fraction:

\[ 21d \cdot 1948 - 46(2581 - 84d) = 53 \cdot 1948 \]
\[ 40908d - 118666 - 3864d = 103244 \]
\[ 40908d - 3864d = 103244 + 118666 \]
\[ 37044d = 221910 \]
\[ d = \frac{221910}{37044} \]
\[ d = 6 \]

Now substitute \(d = 6\) back into the expression for \(f\):

\[ f = \frac{2581 - 84 \cdot 6}{1948} \]
\[ f = \frac{2581 - 504}{1948} \]
\[ f = \frac{2077}{1948} \]
\[ f = 1.066 \]

So, the values of \(d\) and \(f\) are:

1. \( 74u + 11w = 116 \)
2. \( 66u - 68w = 21 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, we need to make the coefficients of either \( u \) or \( w \) the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( u \). To do this, we need to find a common multiple of the coefficients of \( u \) in both equations, which are 74 and 66. The least common multiple (LCM) of 74 and 66 is 2442.

We will multiply the first equation by 66 and the second equation by 74:

\[
66(74u + 11w) = 66(116)
\]
\[
74(66u - 68w) = 74(21)
\]

This gives us:

\[
4884u + 726w = 7656
\]
\[
4884u - 5032w = 1554
\]

Next, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( u \):

\[
(4884u + 726w) - (4884u - 5032w) = 7656 - 1554
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
4884u + 726w - 4884u + 5032w = 6102
\]
\[
5758w = 6102
\]

Solving for \( w \):

\[
w = \frac{6102}{5758} \approx 1.06
\]

Now, substitute \( w \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( u \). We'll use the first equation:

\[
74u + 11(1.06) = 116

\[
74u + 11.66 = 116

\[
74u = 116 - 11.66

\[
74u = 104.34

1. \( 76f - 42j = 96 \)
2. \( 47j + 34f = 136 \)

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's align the equations for clarity:

\[
76f - 42j = 96 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]
\[
34f + 47j = 136 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply each equation by a suitable number so that the coefficients of one of the variables are opposites. Let's eliminate \( j \) by making the coefficients of \( j \) in both equations equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Multiply Equation 1 by 47 and Equation 2 by 42:

\[
47(76f - 42j) = 47(96)
\]
\[
42(34f + 47j) = 42(136)
\]

This gives us:

\[
3572f - 1974j = 4512 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]
\[
1428f + 1974j = 5712 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Now, add Equation 3 and Equation 4 to eliminate \( j \):

\[
3572f - 1974j + 1428f + 1974j = 4512 + 5712
\]

Simplify:

\[
5000f = 10224
\]

Solve for \( f \):

\[
f = \frac{10224}{5000} = 2.0448
\]

Now, substitute \( f = 2.0448 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( j \). We'll use Equation 2:

\[
34(2.0448) + 47j = 136
\]

Calculate \( 34(2.0448) \):

\[
34 \times 2.0448 = 69.5232
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
69.5232 + 47j = 136
\]

Subtract 69.5232 from both sides:

\[
47j = 136 - 69.5232
\]
\[
47j = 66.4768
\]

Solve for \( j \):

\[
j = \frac{66.4768}{47} = 1.4144

Thus, the values of \( f \) and \( j \) that satisfy the system of equations are:

1. \( 68u + 32e = 174 \)
2. \( 63e - 69u = 1 \)

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 63 and the second equation by 68 to align the coefficients of \( e \):

\[
63 \cdot (68u + 32e) = 63 \cdot 174
\]
\[
68 \cdot (63e - 69u) = 68 \cdot 1
\]

This gives us:

\[
4284u + 2016e = 10962
\]
\[
4284e - 4692u = 68
\]

Next, we add these two equations to eliminate \( u \):

\[
4284u + 2016e + 4284e - 4692u = 10962 + 68
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
(4284u - 4692u) + (2016e + 4284e) = 11030
\]
\[
-408u + 6300e = 11030

Now, solve for \( e \):

\[
6300e = 11030 + 408u
\]
\[
e = \frac{11030 + 408u}{6300}
\]

Next, substitute \( e \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( u \). Let's use the first equation:

\[
68u + 32 \left( \frac{11030 + 408u}{6300} \right) = 174
\]

Multiply through by 6300 to clear the fraction:

\[
68 \cdot 6300u + 32 \cdot (11030 + 408u) = 174 \cdot 6300
\]
\[
428400u + 352960 + 13056u = 1096200
\]
\[
441456u + 352960 = 1096200
\]

Subtract 352960 from both sides:

\[
441456u = 743240
\]

Divide by 441456:

\[
u = \frac{743240}{441456}
\]
\[
u \approx 1.684
\]

Now substitute \( u \approx 1.684 \) back into the equation for \( e \):

\[
e = \frac{11030 + 408 \cdot 1.684}{6300}
\]
\[
e \approx \frac{11030 + 687.552}{6300}
\]
\[
e \approx \frac{11717.552}{6300}

\[
e \approx 1.86

First, we need to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( p \). To do this, we need to find a common multiple of the coefficients of \( p \) in both equations (57 and 24). The least common multiple (LCM) of 57 and 24 is 456.

We will multiply the first equation by 24 and the second equation by 57:

\[ 24(57p + 4n) = 24(129) \]
\[ 57(24p + 39n) = 57(154) \]

This gives us:

\[ 1368p + 96n = 3096 \]
\[ 1368p + 2223n = 8778 \]

Next, we subtract the first new equation from the second new equation to eliminate \( p \):

\[ (1368p + 2223n) - (1368p + 96n) = 8778 - 3096 \]
\[ 2223n - 96n = 5682 \]
\[ 2127n = 5682 \]

Now, solve for \( n \):

\[ n = \frac{5682}{2127} \]
\[ n = 2.67 \]

Now that we have \( n \), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for \( p \). Let's use the first equation:

\[ 57p + 4(2.67) = 129 \]
\[ 57p + 10.68 = 129 \]
\[ 57p = 129 - 10.68 \]
\[ 57p = 118.32 \]
\[ p = \frac{118.32}{57} \]
\[ p = 2.08 \]

So, the values of \( p \) and \( n \) that satisfy the system of equations are:

1) \( 66z - 44y = 32 \)
2) \( 60y + 14z = 116 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's simplify both equations by dividing them by their greatest common divisors:

1) \( 66z - 44y = 32 \) can be divided by 2:
\[ 33z - 22y = 16 \]

2) \( 60y + 14z = 116 \) can be divided by 2:
\[ 30y + 7z = 58 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[ 33z - 22y = 16 \]
\[ 30y + 7z = 58 \]

Next, we will eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate \( z \). To do this, we need to make the coefficients of \( z \) in both equations equal. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 33:

\[ 7(33z - 22y) = 7(16) \]
\[ 231z - 154y = 112 \]

\[ 33(30y + 7z) = 33(58) \]
\[ 990y + 231z = 1914 \]

Now we have:
\[ 231z - 154y = 112 \]
\[ 990y + 231z = 1914 \]

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( z \):
\[ (990y + 231z) - (231z - 154y) = 1914 - 112 \]
\[ 990y + 231z - 231z + 154y = 1802 \]
\[ 1144y = 1802 \]

Solve for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{1802}{1144} \]
\[ y = \frac{901}{572} \]

Now substitute \( y \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( z \). Using the simplified second equation:
\[ 30y + 7z = 58 \]
\[ 30 \left(\frac{901}{572}\right) + 7z = 58 \]
\[ \frac{27030}{572} + 7z = 58 \]
\[ 7z = 58 - \frac{27030}{572} \]
\[ 7z = 58 - 47.25 \]
\[ 7z = 10.75 \]
\[ z = \frac{10.75}{7} \]
\[ z = 1.5357 \]

1. \( 83t - 58h = 45 \)
2. \( 69h + 11t = 124 \)

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 83 and the first equation by 11 to align the coefficients of \( t \):

\[
83(69h + 11t) = 83 \cdot 124
\]
\[
11(83t - 58h) = 11 \cdot 45
\]

This gives us:

\[
5727h + 913t = 10292
\]
\[
913t - 638h = 495
\]

Next, we subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate \( t \):

\[
(5727h + 913t) - (913t - 638h) = 10292 - 495
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
5727h + 913t - 913t + 638h = 10292 - 495
\]
\[
6365h = 9797
\]

Solving for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{9797}{6365} = \frac{9797 \div 7}{6365 \div 7} = \frac{1397}{910}
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
h = \frac{1397 \div 7}{910 \div 7} = \frac{199.571}{130} \approx 1.536
\]

Now, substitute \( h \approx 1.536 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( t \). Using the second equation:

\[
69h + 11t = 124
\]
\[
69(1.536) + 11t = 124
\]
\[
106.944 + 11t = 124

\[
11t = 124 - 106.944

\[
11t = 17.056

\[
t = \frac{17.056}{11} \approx 1.55

1. \( 79h - 61o = 9 \)
2. \( 16h - 12o = 9 \)

We can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the second equation by a factor that will allow us to eliminate one of the variables when we subtract the equations. We can multiply the second equation by 61 to match the coefficient of \( o \) in the first equation:

\[ 61(16h - 12o) = 61 \cdot 9 \]
\[ 976h - 732o = 549 \]

Now, we have the system:
1. \( 79h - 61o = 9 \)
2. \( 976h - 732o = 549 \)

Next, multiply the first equation by 12 to match the coefficient of \( o \) in the second equation:

\[ 12(79h - 61o) = 12 \cdot 9 \]
\[ 948h - 732o = 108 \]

Now, we have:
1. \( 948h - 732o = 108 \)
2. \( 976h - 732o = 549 \)

Subtract the first modified equation from the second modified equation to eliminate \( o \):

\[ (976h - 732o) - (948h - 732o) = 549 - 108 \]
\[ 28h = 441 \]

Solve for \( h \):

\[ h = \frac{441}{28} \]
\[ h = 15.75 \]

Now, substitute \( h = 15.75 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( o \). We'll use the first equation:

\[ 79(15.75) - 61o = 9 \]
\[ 1244.25 - 61o = 9 \]
\[ 1244.25 - 9 = 61o \]
\[ 1235.25 = 61o \]

Solve for \( o \):

\[ o = 20.25 \]

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 65 and the second equation by 4 to make the coefficients of \( y \) the same:

\[
65 \cdot (4y + 56s) = 65 \cdot 139
\]
\[
4 \cdot (65y - 90s) = 4 \cdot 16
\]

This gives us:

\[
260y + 3640s = 9035
\]
\[
260y - 360s = 64
\]

Next, we subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate \( y \):

\[
(260y + 3640s) - (260y - 360s) = 9035 - 64
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[

\[
4000s = 8971

\[

Now, substitute \( s = 2.24275 \) back into the first equation to solve for \( y \):

\[

\[

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's eliminate one of the variables. We can start by making the coefficients of \(d\) the same in both equations. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 40 and the second equation by 42:

\[
40 \times (42d - 4z) = 40 \times 75
\]
\[
42 \times (40d + 45z) = 42 \times 162
\]

This gives us:

\[
1680d - 160z = 3000
\]
\[
1680d + 1890z = 6804
\]

Next, we subtract the first modified equation from the second modified equation to eliminate \(d\):

\[
(1680d + 1890z) - (1680d - 160z) = 6804 - 3000

\[
2050z = 3804

Solving for \(z\):

\[
z = \frac{3804}{2050} = 1.8556

Now, substitute \(z = 1.8556\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(d\). We'll use the first equation:

\[
42d - 4(1.8556) = 75
\]
\[
42d - 7.4224 = 75

\[

The given system of equations is:
1. \( 42o + 24a = 142 \)
2. \( 42a + 6o = 75 \)

First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 6:
\[ 7a + o = 12.5 \]

Now we have:
1. \( 42o + 24a = 142 \)
2. \( 7a + o = 12.5 \)

Next, we can express \( o \) from the second equation:
\[ o = 12.5 - 7a \]

Now substitute \( o \) in the first equation:
\[ 42(12.5 - 7a) + 24a = 142 \]

Distribute 42:
\[ 42 \cdot 12.5 - 42 \cdot 7a + 24a = 142 \]
\[ 525 - 294a + 24a = 142 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 525 - 270a = 142 \]

Subtract 525 from both sides:
\[ -270a = 142 - 525 \]
\[ -270a = -383 \]

Divide both sides by -270:
\[ a = \frac{-383}{-270} \]
\[ a = \frac{383}{270} \]
\[ a = \frac{383}{270} \approx 1.4185 \]

Now substitute \( a \approx 1.4185 \) back into the equation \( o = 12.5 - 7a \):
\[ o = 12.5 - 7 \cdot 1.4185 \]
\[ o = 12.5 - 9.9295 \]
\[ o \approx 2.5705 \]

So, the approximate values of \( a \) and \( o \) are:

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 8 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of \( p \) in both equations equal:

\[ 8(39r - 2p) = 8(45) \]
\[ 1(16p - 84r) = 1(36) \]

This gives us:

\[ 312r - 16p = 360 \]
\[ 16p - 84r = 36 \]

Now, add the two equations together to eliminate \( p \):

\[ 312r - 16p + 16p - 84r = 360 + 36 \]
\[ 312r - 84r = 396 \]
\[ 228r = 396 \]

Solve for \( r \):

\[ r = \frac{396}{228} \]
\[ r = \frac{198}{114} \]
\[ r = \frac{99}{57} \]
\[ r = \frac{33}{19} \]

Now, substitute \( r = \frac{33}{19} \) back into the first equation to solve for \( p \):

\[ 39 \left( \frac{33}{19} \right) - 2p = 45 \]
\[ \frac{1287}{19} - 2p = 45 \]

Multiply through by 19 to clear the fraction:

\[ 1287 - 855 = 38p \]
\[ 432 = 38p \]

            Given the following system of equations, solve for the values of 'd' and 'w':

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

1. \( 23d - 52w = 7 \)
2. \( 64w - 8d = 58 \)

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's rewrite the second equation to align the terms with the first equation:

\[ -8d + 64w = 58 \]

Now, let's multiply the first equation by 8 to align the coefficients of \(d\):

\[ 8(23d - 52w) = 8(7) \]
\[ 184d - 416w = 56 \]

Next, let's multiply the second equation by 23 to align the coefficients of \(d\):

\[ 23(-8d + 64w) = 23(58) \]
\[ -184d + 1472w = 1334 \]

Now we have the system:

\[ 184d - 416w = 56 \]
\[ -184d + 1472w = 1334 \]

We can add these two equations to eliminate \(d\):

\[ (184d - 416w) + (-184d + 1472w) = 56 + 1334 \]
\[ 0d + 1056w = 1390 \]
\[ 1056w = 1390 \]
\[ w = \frac{1390}{1056} \]
\[ w = \frac{695}{528} \]
\[ w = \frac{695}{528} \approx 1.316 \]

Now, substitute \( w \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( d \). We'll use the first equation:

\[ 23d - 52w = 7 \]
\[ 23d - 52 \left( \frac{695}{528} \right) = 7 \]
\[ 23d - \frac{52 \times 695}{528} = 7 \]
\[ 23d - \frac{36140}{528} = 7 \]
\[ 23d - 68.44 \approx 7 \]
\[ 23d \approx 75.44 \]
\[ d \approx \frac{75.44}{23} \]
\[ d \approx 3.28 \]

\[
71z + 60n = 184
\]
\[
52z - 47n = 19
\]

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, we need to eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate \(z\). To do this, we need to make the coefficients of \(z\) in both equations equal. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 52 and the second equation by 71:

\[
52(71z + 60n) = 52 \cdot 184
\]
\[
71(52z - 47n) = 71 \cdot 19
\]

This gives us:

\[
3692z + 3120n = 9568
\]
\[
3692z - 3337n = 1349
\]

Next, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \(z\):

\[
(3692z + 3120n) - (3692z - 3337n) = 9568 - 1349
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
3692z + 3120n - 3692z + 3337n = 8219
\]
\[
6457n = 8219
\]

Solving for \(n\):

\[
n = \frac{8219}{6457} = 1.273
\]

Now, substitute \(n = 1.273\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(z\). We'll use the first equation:

\[
71z + 60(1.273) = 184
\]
\[
71z + 76.38 = 184
\]
\[
71z = 184 - 76.38
\]
\[
71z = 107.62
\]
\[
z = \frac{107.62}{71} = 1.515
\]

Thus, the values of \(n\) and \(z\) are:

1. \( 70e + 90z = 189 \)
2. \( 99z - 84e = 20 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 84 and the second equation by 70 to align the coefficients of \( e \):

\[
84 \times (70e + 90z) = 84 \times 189
\]
\[
70 \times (99z - 84e) = 70 \times 20
\]

This gives us:

\[
5880e + 7560z = 15876
\]
\[
6930z - 5880e = 1400
\]

Now, add the two equations to eliminate \( e \):

\[
5880e + 7560z + 6930z - 5880e = 15876 + 1400
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
14490z = 17276
\]

Solving for \( z \):

\[
z = \frac{17276}{14490} \approx 1.192
\]

Now, substitute \( z \approx 1.192 \) back into the first equation to solve for \( e \):

\[
70e + 90(1.192) = 189
\]

\[
70e + 107.28 = 189
\]

\[
70e = 189 - 107.28
\]

\[
70e = 81.72
\]

\[
e = \frac{81.72}{70} \approx 1.167
\]

Thus, the values of \( e \) and \( z \) are approximately:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:

1) \( 26o - 44f = 95 \)
2) \( 87f + 11o = 169 \)

we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's align the equations for clarity:

\[
26o - 44f = 95 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]
\[
87f + 11o = 169 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

To eliminate one of the variables, we need to make the coefficients of either \( o \) or \( f \) the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( o \) by making the coefficients of \( o \) in both equations equal. We can do this by multiplying Equation 1 by 11 and Equation 2 by 26:

\[
11(26o - 44f) = 11(95)
\]
\[
26(87f + 11o) = 26(169)
\]

This gives us:

\[
286o - 484f = 1045 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]
\[
2262f + 286o = 4394 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Next, we subtract Equation 3 from Equation 4 to eliminate \( o \):

\[
(2262f + 286o) - (286o - 484f) = 4394 - 1045
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
2262f + 286o - 286o + 484f = 3349
\]
\[
2746f = 3349
\]

Solving for \( f \):

\[
f = \frac{3349}{2746} \approx 1.22
\]

Now, substitute \( f \approx 1.22 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( o \). We'll use Equation 1:

\[
26o - 44(1.22) = 95
\]
\[
26o - 53.68 = 95
\]
\[
26o = 148.68
\]
\[
o = \frac{148.68}{26} \approx 5.72
\]

Thus, the values of \( o \) and \( f \) that satisfy the system of equations are approximately:

1. \( 40z - 20p = 51 \)
2. \( 6z + 58p = 165 \)

we can use the method of elimination or substitution. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, let's multiply the second equation by a factor that will allow us to eliminate one of the variables when we add or subtract the equations. We can multiply the second equation by \( \frac{20}{6} \) to make the coefficients of \( z \) in both equations equal:

\[ \frac{20}{6} \times (6z + 58p) = \frac{20}{6} \times 165 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 20z + \frac{20}{6} \times 58p = \frac{20}{6} \times 165 \]

\[ 20z + \frac{1160}{6}p = \frac{3300}{6} \]

\[ 20z + 193.33p = 550 \]

Now we have the system:

1. \( 40z - 20p = 51 \)
2. \( 20z + 193.33p = 550 \)

Next, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of \( z \) in both equations equal:

\[ 2 \times (40z - 20p) = 2 \times 51 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 80z - 40p = 102 \]

Now we have the system:

1. \( 80z - 40p = 102 \)
2. \( 20z + 193.33p = 550 \)

Next, we can multiply the second equation by 4 to make the coefficients of \( z \) in both equations equal:

\[ 4 \times (20z + 193.33p) = 4 \times 550 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 80z + 773.32p = 2200 \]

Now we have the system:

1. \( 80z - 40p = 102 \)
2. \( 80z + 773.32p = 2200 \)

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( z \):

\[ (80z + 773.32p) - (80z - 40p) = 2200 - 102 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 813.32p = 2098 \]

Solving for \( p \):

\[ p = \frac{2098}{813.32} \]

\[ p \approx 2.58 \]

Now we can substitute \( p \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( z \). Using the first equation:

\[ 40z - 20(2.58) = 51 \]

\[ 40z - 51.6 = 51 \]

\[ 40z = 102.6 \]

\[ z = \frac{102.6}{40} \]

\[ z \approx 2.57 \]

1) \( 71s - 89f = 5 \)

we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 7 to align the coefficients of \( f \):

\[ 7(3f + 10s) = 7(93) \]
\[ 21f + 70s = 651 \]

Now we have the system:

1) \( 71s - 89f = 5 \)
2) \( 70s + 21f = 651 \)

Next, we will multiply the first equation by 21 and the second equation by 89 to align the coefficients of \( f \):

\[ 21(71s - 89f) = 21(5) \]
\[ 1491s - 1869f = 105 \]

\[ 89(70s + 21f) = 89(651) \]
\[ 6230s + 1869f = 57939 \]

Now we add these two equations to eliminate \( f \):

\[ 7721s = 58044 \]

Solving for \( s \):

\[ s = \frac{58044}{7721} \]
\[ s = 7.52 \]

Now substitute \( s = 7.52 \) back into the second original equation to solve for \( f \):

\[ 3f + 10(7.52) = 93 \]
\[ 3f + 75.2 = 93 \]
\[ 3f = 93 - 75.2 \]
\[ 3f = 17.8 \]
