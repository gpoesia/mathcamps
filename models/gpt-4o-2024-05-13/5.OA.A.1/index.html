            A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how many additional packs of socks the company can make with the 2840 socks they have.

Each pack contains 40 socks, so we divide the total number of socks by the number of socks per pack:
\[ \frac{2840}{40} = 71 \]

This means the company can make 71 additional packs with the 2840 socks.

Next, we add these 71 packs to the 93 packs they already have:
\[ 93 + 71 = 164 \]

So, the company will have 164 packs of socks once all the socks have been packaged.

Afterward, the company received an additional shipment of 70 packs of socks. Adding these to the 164 packs they already have:
\[ 164 + 70 = 234 \]

However, they had to return 8 packs due to quality issues:
\[ 234 - 8 = 226 \]

Therefore, the company now has 226 packs of socks.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the height of one leap by the dolphin. The height of one leap is given by the expression \(3 + 59\):

\[ 3 + 59 = 62 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the total height jumped by the dolphin in a day if it completes 89 jumps. We do this by multiplying the height of one leap by the number of jumps:

\[ 62 \text{ feet/jump} \times 89 \text{ jumps} \]

To perform the multiplication:

\[ 62 \times 89 \]

We can break this down using the distributive property:

\[ 62 \times 89 = 62 \times (90 - 1) = 62 \times 90 - 62 \times 1 \]

First, calculate \(62 \times 90\):

\[ 62 \times 90 = 5580 \]

Next, calculate \(62 \times 1\):

\[ 62 \times 1 = 62 \]

Now, subtract the two results:

\[ 5580 - 62 = 5518 \]

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pairs of ice skates each store receives, we need to divide the total number of pairs of ice skates by the number of stores.

Given:
- Total pairs of ice skates = 6806
- Number of stores = 82

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{6806}{82} \]

First, let's set up the division:

\[ 6806 \div 82 \]

1. 82 goes into 6806 approximately 82 times. Let's calculate it step by step.

2. 82 goes into 680 (the first three digits of 6806) approximately 8 times (since \( 82 \times 8 = 656 \)).

3. Subtract 656 from 680:

\[ 680 - 656 = 24 \]

4. Bring down the next digit, which is 6, making it 246.

5. 82 goes into 246 approximately 3 times (since \( 82 \times 3 = 246 \)).

6. Subtract 246 from 246:

\[ 246 - 246 = 0 \]

So, the division is exact, and each store receives:

\[ 6806 \div 82 = 83 \]

Given:

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{6806}{61} \]

First, let's set up the division:

\[ 6806 \div 61 \]

1. 61 goes into 680 (the first three digits of 6806) approximately 11 times (since \( 61 \times 11 = 671 \)).

2. Subtract 671 from 680:

\[ 680 - 671 = 9 \]

3. Bring down the next digit, which is 6, making it 96.

4. 61 goes into 96 approximately 1 time (since \( 61 \times 1 = 61 \)).

5. Subtract 61 from 96:

\[ 96 - 61 = 35 \]

So, the division is:

\[ 6806 \div 61 = 111 \text{ remainder } 35 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of pens produced, we need to multiply the number of pens in each batch by the corrected number of batches.

Each batch contains 39 pens, and the company actually produced 43 batches. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 39 \text{ pens/batch} \times 43 \text{ batches} \]

First, we can break this multiplication into simpler parts:

\[ 39 \times 43 = 39 \times (40 + 3) \]
\[ = 39 \times 40 + 39 \times 3 \]
\[ = 1560 + 117 \]

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine how much milk each cow gives per day. 

\[ 99 + 58 = 157 \]

So, each cow gives 157 litres of milk per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of milk produced by all 33 cows in a day:

\[ 33 \times 157 \]

To simplify the multiplication, we can break it down:

\[ 33 \times 157 = 33 \times (100 + 57) = 33 \times 100 + 33 \times 57 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

\[ 33 \times 100 = 3300 \]

For \( 33 \times 57 \), we can use the distributive property again:

\[ 33 \times 57 = 33 \times (50 + 7) = 33 \times 50 + 33 \times 7 \]

\[ 33 \times 50 = 1650 \]

\[ 33 \times 7 = 231 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 1650 + 231 = 1881 \]

Now, add the two main parts:

\[ 3300 + 1881 = 5181 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

\[ 33 \times 60 = 1980 \]

Next, the farmer eats 13 bags of grapes and gives away 50 bags of grapes. We need to subtract these from the initial number of bags:

\[ \text{Velocity} = \frac{1095 \text{ miles/second}}{42} \]

First, we perform the division:

3. Bring down the next digit (5), making it 255.
4. 42 goes into 255 six times (since \(42 \times 6 = 252\)).
5. Subtract 252 from 255 to get 3.

So, the division results in:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to calculate the total number of lemons produced by the lemon tree over 40 years.

The tree produces 99 lemons each year, so over 40 years, the total number of lemons produced is:
\[ 99 \text{ lemons/year} \times 40 \text{ years} = 3960 \text{ lemons} \]

Next, we need to account for the 84 lemons removed by the wind storm. We subtract these 84 lemons from the total number of lemons produced:
\[ 3960 \text{ lemons} - 84 \text{ lemons} = 3876 \text{ lemons} \]

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{1767}{31} \]

First, let's do the division step-by-step:

1. 1767 divided by 31.
2. 31 goes into 176 five times (since \( 31 \times 5 = 155 \)).
3. Subtract 155 from 176 to get 21.
4. Bring down the next digit (7), making it 217.
5. 31 goes into 217 seven times (since \( 31 \times 7 = 217 \)).

So, the division is exact:

Given:
- New total windows to produce in a month: 50

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{50}{31} \]

First, let's do the division step-by-step:

1. 50 divided by 31.
2. 31 goes into 50 one time (since \( 31 \times 1 = 31 \)).
3. Subtract 31 from 50 to get 19.

So, the division is:

\[ 50 \div 31 \approx 1.6129 \]

Therefore, the factory needs to produce approximately 1.6129 windows each day to meet its new goal. Since the factory cannot produce a fraction of a window, it would need to produce either 1 or 2 windows per day, depending on how they manage the production schedule.

2. The 2nd season had 8 episodes.
3. The 3rd season has aired 8 episodes so far.

We add these numbers together:

\[ 66 + 8 + 8 \]

First, add the episodes from the 1st and 2nd seasons:

\[ 66 + 8 = 74 \]

Next, add the episodes from the 3rd season:

\[ 74 + 8 = 82 \]

So, the total number of episodes that have aired is 82.

            At the end of a rainbow, a leprechaun is guarding a pot of gold coins. He adds 39 gold coins to the pot, then another 47. However, while he is distracted, a fairy takes away 8 gold coins from the pot. The new total of coins becomes a code to a magical lock.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The leprechaun adds 39 gold coins to the pot.
2. Then, he adds another 47 gold coins.

First, we calculate the total number of coins added by the leprechaun:
\[ 39 + 47 = 86 \]

3. A fairy takes away 8 gold coins from the pot.

We subtract the coins taken by the fairy from the total:
\[ 86 - 8 = 78 \]

4. The new total of coins (78) becomes a code to a magical lock. This code must be enhanced by adding 48 to it only once.

We add 48 to the code:
\[ 78 + 48 = 126 \]

5. Finally, the enhanced code is multiplied by 24.

We perform the multiplication:
\[ 126 \times 24 = 3024 \]

Thus, the final value to unlock the magical lock is:

            A cucumber farm yields 2592 cucumbers per 54 plants. If a section of the farm grows 38 plants, subtracting the 74 cucumbers that were damaged, how many cucumbers are available for sale?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the yield per plant. The farm yields 2592 cucumbers from 54 plants. 

To find the yield per plant, we divide the total number of cucumbers by the number of plants:
\[ \text{Yield per plant} = \frac{2592 \text{ cucumbers}}{54 \text{ plants}} = 48 \text{ cucumbers per plant} \]

Next, we calculate the total yield from 38 plants:
\[ \text{Total yield from 38 plants} = 38 \text{ plants} \times 48 \text{ cucumbers per plant} = 1824 \text{ cucumbers} \]

We then subtract the 74 cucumbers that were damaged:
\[ \text{Cucumbers available for sale} = 1824 \text{ cucumbers} - 74 \text{ cucumbers} = 1750 \text{ cucumbers} \]

            A toy car battery lasts 16 hours. However, if the car's lights are used, the battery life decreases by the equivalent of 36 divided by 9 hours. Assuming the toy car is run with the lights on for 12 full weeks, each week considered to be 60 hours, how long did the battery last?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's determine how much the battery life decreases when the car's lights are used. The decrease in battery life is given by:

\[ \frac{36}{9} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, when the lights are used, the battery life is reduced by 4 hours. Therefore, the new battery life with the lights on is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} - 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours the toy car is run with the lights on over 12 weeks. Each week is considered to be 60 hours, so:

\[ 12 \text{ weeks} \times 60 \text{ hours/week} = 720 \text{ hours} \]

Since the battery lasts 12 hours with the lights on, we need to determine how many full battery cycles are required to cover 720 hours:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours/battery}} = 60 \text{ batteries} \]

Thus, the battery lasted for 60 full cycles of 12 hours each.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the amount of each installment, we need to divide the total cost of the wallet by the number of installments.

Total cost of the wallet: $2407
Number of installments: 83

We perform the division:

\[ \frac{2407}{83} \]

First, let's do the division step-by-step:

1. 2407 divided by 83 gives approximately 29.012.
2. Since we are dealing with money, we round to the nearest cent.

So, each installment would be approximately $29.012, which rounds to $29.01.

Next, we need to find out how many carrots the farmer collects over 77 days. We do this by multiplying the daily total by the number of days:

\[ 66 \text{ kites} \]

Next, the kite maker decides to multiply this current inventory by 18:

Calculating this:

\[ 66 \times 18 = 1188 \]

Now, we add the original inventory (before giving away and creating additional kites) to this increased production. The original inventory was:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's recall the minutes Rachel watched on Monday and Tuesday:
- Monday: 35 minutes
- Tuesday: 61 minutes

On Wednesday, Rachel initially watched 68 minutes of TV. She decided to reduce her screen time by the amount she had watched on Monday, which is 35 minutes.

To find the reduced screen time on Wednesday, we subtract the 35 minutes from the 68 minutes:
\[ 68 - 35 = 33 \]

Now, we add the total minutes watched on Monday, Tuesday, and the reduced time on Wednesday:
\[ 35 + 61 + 33 = 129 \]

1. The little mouse initially had 91 pieces of cheese.
2. A thief mouse stole 77 pieces of cheese.

First, we calculate how many pieces of cheese the little mouse has left after the theft:
\[ 91 - 77 = 14 \]

3. The little mouse then found 22 more pieces of cheese.

Adding these to the remaining pieces:
\[ 14 + 22 = 36 \]

4. A kind mouse gave the little mouse 12 more pieces of cheese.

Adding these to the current total:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total amount of fish and squid a dolphin needs over 59 days, we first calculate the daily total and then multiply by the number of days.

1. Calculate the total daily intake:
   - Fish: 96 kilograms
   - Squid: 22 kilograms
   - Total daily intake = 96 kg (fish) + 22 kg (squid) = 118 kg

2. Multiply the total daily intake by the number of days:
   - Total intake over 59 days = 118 kg/day * 59 days

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 118 \times 59 = 118 \times (60 - 1) = 118 \times 60 - 118 \times 1 \]
\[ 118 \times 60 = 7080 \]
\[ 118 \times 1 = 118 \]
\[ 7080 - 118 = 6962 \]

So, the dolphin would need a total of 6962 kilograms of fish and squid over 59 days.

1. Calculate the total daily intake with the new diet:

   - Total daily intake = 96 kg (fish) + 8 kg (squid) = 104 kg

2. Multiply the total daily intake by the number of days:
   - Total intake over 59 days = 104 kg/day * 59 days

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 104 \times 59 = 104 \times (60 - 1) = 104 \times 60 - 104 \times 1 \]
\[ 104 \times 60 = 6240 \]
\[ 104 \times 1 = 104 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total number of grapevines the farmer has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of new vines added.
2. Subtract the number of vines that have died from the total number of new vines.

First, let's add the new vines:
\[ 93 + 73 = 166 \]

Next, subtract the number of vines that have died:
\[ 166 - 92 = 74 \]

So, the farmer now has 74 grapevines.

\[ 65 + 73 = 138 \]

Next, subtract the number of vines that have died:

            A blanket factory makes 13 blankets in the morning and 81 in the afternoon, but returns 59 due to defects. Each blanket is sold at a price equal to 39 times the total number of good blankets they have, plus the number of good blankets. What's the total value of the blankets they've sold?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the total number of good blankets produced by the factory. The factory makes 13 blankets in the morning and 81 blankets in the afternoon:

\[ 13 + 81 = 94 \]

Out of these 94 blankets, 59 are returned due to defects. Therefore, the number of good blankets is:

\[ 94 - 59 = 35 \]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price of each blanket. According to the problem, each blanket is sold at a price equal to 39 times the total number of good blankets plus the number of good blankets. This can be expressed as:

\[ 39 \times 35 + 35 \]

First, calculate \( 39 \times 35 \):

\[ 39 \times 35 = 1365 \]

Then, add the number of good blankets:

\[ 1365 + 35 = 1400 \]

So, each blanket is sold for 1400 units of currency. Since there are 35 good blankets, the total value of the blankets sold is:

\[ 35 \times 1400 = 49000 \]

To find out how many miles the bus travels per stage, we divide the total distance by the number of parts:

\[
\text{Miles per stage} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Number of parts}} = \frac{1300 \text{ miles}}{5}

Next, the shop decides to multiply the total number of cameras by 77 for promotional reasons. Therefore, we need to calculate:

To simplify the multiplication, we can use the distributive property:

\[ = 96 \times 70 + 96 \times 7 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

\[ 25 + 71 = 96 \]

Next, the shop decides to multiply the total number of cameras by 56 for promotional reasons. Therefore, we need to calculate:

\[ 96 \times 56 \]

To simplify the multiplication, we can use the distributive property:

\[ 96 \times 56 = 96 \times (50 + 6) \]
\[ = 96 \times 50 + 96 \times 6 \]

Now, calculate each part separately:

\[ 96 \times 50 = 4800 \]
\[ 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

Adding these two results together:

\[ 4800 + 576 = 5376 \]

Thus, the shop would have had 5376 cameras for promotion.

First, we perform the division:
\[ \frac{1424 \text{ bars}}{16 \text{ bars per package}} \]

First, we perform the division:

Now, let's calculate:

Next, we need to account for the rotten potatoes. According to the problem, 71 tons were rotten. However, this seems to be an inconsistency because the total production is only 36 tons, and it is not possible to have more rotten potatoes than the total produced. 

Given this inconsistency, let's assume the problem meant to say that out of the total production, 71 tons were found to be rotten, but this would imply an error in the problem statement.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the new sprinkling rate after the reduction. The original rate is 4332 milligrams every 76 minutes. 

To find the rate per minute, we divide the total milligrams by the total minutes:

Calculating this:
\[ \text{Original rate per minute} = \frac{4332}{76} \approx 57 \text{ mg/min} \]

Next, we reduce this rate by 44 milligrams:
\[ \text{New rate per minute} = 57 \text{ mg/min} - 44 \text{ mg/min} = 13 \text{ mg/min} \]

Now, we need to find out how much magical dust she will sprinkle in 52 minutes at this new rate:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the new sprinkling rate after the reduction. The original rate is 4332 milligrams every 76 minutes.

To find the rate per minute, we divide the total milligrams by the total minutes:
\[ \text{Original rate per minute} = \frac{4332 \text{ mg}}{76 \text{ min}} \]

Calculating this:
\[ \text{Original rate per minute} = \frac{4332}{76} \approx 57 \text{ mg/min} \]

Next, we reduce this rate by 44 milligrams:
\[ \text{New rate per minute} = 57 \text{ mg/min} - 44 \text{ mg/min} = 13 \text{ mg/min} \]

Now, we need to find out how much magical dust she will sprinkle in 22 minutes at this new rate:
\[ \text{Total dust sprinkled} = \text{New rate per minute} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Total dust sprinkled} = 13 \text{ mg/min} \times 22 \text{ min} \]

Calculating this:
\[ \text{Total dust sprinkled} = 286 \text{ mg} \]

1. John initially took 30 pictures.
2. He accidentally deleted 81 pictures.
3. He recovered 61 of the deleted pictures.

First, we need to determine the net effect of the deletion and recovery on the number of pictures:

- John deleted 81 pictures.
- He recovered 61 of those deleted pictures.

So, the net number of pictures deleted is:
\[ 81 - 61 = 20 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the total number of rainbow apples the magical unicorn has. This is given by the expression:

\[
(54 - 24) + 25

First, we perform the subtraction inside the parentheses:

\[
54 - 24 = 30
\]

Next, we add 25 to the result:

\[
30 + 25 = 55

So, the unicorn has 55 rainbow apples.

Each rainbow apple can be traded for 51 sparkly diamonds. Therefore, the total number of sparkly diamonds the unicorn can get is:

\[
55 \times 51
\]

To find this product, we can use the distributive property:

\[
55 \times 51 = 55 \times (50 + 1) = 55 \times 50 + 55 \times 1

Calculating each term separately:

\[

54 - 24 = 30
\]

Next, we add 38 to the result:

\[
30 + 38 = 68
\]

So, the unicorn has 68 rainbow apples.

Each rainbow apple can be traded for 51 sparkly diamonds. Therefore, the total number of sparkly diamonds the unicorn can get is:

\[
68 \times 51
\]

To find this product, we can use the distributive property:

\[
68 \times 51 = 68 \times (50 + 1) = 68 \times 50 + 68 \times 1
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
68 \times 50 = 3400
\]
\[
68 \times 1 = 68
\]

Adding these results together:

\[
3400 + 68 = 3468
\]

Given:
- Total number of windows = 704
- Number of floors = 71

We perform the division:

Since the number of windows must be a whole number, this suggests that the windows cannot be evenly distributed across 71 floors. However, if we are to consider the exact division:

\[ \frac{704}{71} \approx 9.915492957746478 \]

This means that on average, there would be approximately 9.91 windows per floor, but in practical terms, the distribution would need to be adjusted to whole numbers.

First, we calculate the value of the 35 gemstones. Each gemstone is worth 57 gold coins, so we multiply:
\[ 35 \times 57 \]

We can break this multiplication into simpler steps:
\[ 35 \times 57 = 35 \times (50 + 7) \]
\[ = 35 \times 50 + 35 \times 7 \]

Now, calculate each part:
\[ 35 \times 50 = 1750 \]
\[ 35 \times 7 = 245 \]

Add these two results together:
\[ 1750 + 245 = 1995 \]

So, the total value of the gemstones is 1995 gold coins.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine how many toy cars the factory produces in 76 minutes with the corrected production rate of 4 toy cars per minute. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of minutes by the number of toy cars produced per minute:

\[ 76 \text{ minutes} \times 4 \text{ toy cars per minute} = 304 \text{ toy cars} \]

Next, we add the additional batch of 49 toy cars to the total produced in 76 minutes:

\[ 304 \text{ toy cars} + 49 \text{ toy cars} = 353 \text{ toy cars} \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many buckets can be completely filled, we need to divide the total amount of paint by the capacity of each bucket.

First, we perform the division:
\[ \frac{8930}{95} \]

Let's do the division step-by-step:

1. Divide 8930 by 95:
\[ 8930 \div 95 = 94 \]

So, 8930 liters divided by 95 liters per bucket equals 94 buckets.

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{8930}{95} \]

Let's do the division step-by-step:
\[ 8930 \div 95 = 94 \]

So, the company can fill 94 buckets completely.

Next, we need to account for the missing and found buckets. Initially, the company realized they were missing 73 buckets. Then, they found 59 of those missing buckets.

To find the total number of buckets they have now, we subtract the missing buckets and then add the found buckets:
\[ 94 - 73 + 59 \]

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Building on our beachcomber's tale, after counting his 42-day collection of seashells, he accidentally loses one seashell down a seaside crevice. Disappointed but not defeated, he decides to collect 32 more seashells the next day. How many seashells does he have in total after adding the new batch and accounting for the lost seashell?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total number of seashells the beachcomber has after losing one and then collecting more, we start with the total number of seashells he had before the loss and additional collection.

From the previous calculation, the beachcomber had:
\[ 3164 \text{ seashells} \]

He loses one seashell:
\[ 3164 \text{ seashells} - 1 \text{ seashell} = 3163 \text{ seashells} \]

Then, he collects 32 more seashells:
\[ 3163 \text{ seashells} + 32 \text{ seashells} = 3195 \text{ seashells} \]

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Let's revisit our beachcomber. After reconsidering his collection habit, he realizes he has been actually collecting an average of 89 seashells per day instead of 74, over the same 42 day period. He still found that additional 56 seashells hidden in the sand. Now, how many seashells does he have in total after 42 days?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total number of seashells the beachcomber collected with the updated average, we need to calculate the number of seashells that appeared over the 42 days and then add the additional seashells found.

First, calculate the number of seashells that appeared over 42 days with the new average:
\[ 89 \text{ seashells/day} \times 42 \text{ days} = 3738 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, add the additional 56 seashells that were discovered:
\[ 3738 \text{ seashells} + 56 \text{ seashells} = 3794 \text{ seashells} \]

### Answer: 3794</pre>
