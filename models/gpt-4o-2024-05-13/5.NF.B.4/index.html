        Determine the product when you multiply the fraction 8/9 by the fraction 19/3. Please provide your answer as a simplified fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the product of the fractions \( \frac{8}{9} \) and \( \frac{19}{3} \), we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{8}{9} \times \frac{19}{3} = \frac{8 \times 19}{9 \times 3}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
8 \times 19 = 152
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
9 \times 3 = 27
\]

So, the product of the fractions is:

\[
\frac{152}{27}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 152 and 27. Checking the factors, we see that 152 and 27 have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously determined that the product of \( \frac{8}{9} \) and \( \frac{19}{3} \) is \( \frac{152}{27} \).

Now, we need to multiply this result by 2:

Next, we need to simplify the fraction \( \frac{304}{27} \). To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 304 and 27. Checking the factors, we see that 304 and 27 have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of barrels of apples, we need to multiply the fractions \( \frac{10}{17} \) and \( \frac{18}{5} \).

First, we multiply the numerators:
\[ 10 \times 18 = 180 \]

Next, we multiply the denominators:
\[ 17 \times 5 = 85 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{180}{85} \]

To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 180 and 85. The GCD of 180 and 85 is 5.

We divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{180 \div 5}{85 \div 5} = \frac{36}{17} \]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

        A group of 18 students is planning a pizza party. If each student will eat 17/20 of a pizza, how many pizzas should they order?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many pizzas the group should order, we need to calculate the total amount of pizza that 18 students will consume.

First, we find the total amount of pizza each student will eat:
\[ \text{Amount of pizza per student} = \frac{17}{20} \]

Next, we multiply this amount by the number of students:
\[ \text{Total amount of pizza} = 18 \times \frac{17}{20} \]

We can perform the multiplication:
\[ 18 \times \frac{17}{20} = \frac{18 \times 17}{20} \]

Calculate the numerator:
\[ 18 \times 17 = 306 \]

So, the total amount of pizza is:
\[ \frac{306}{20} \]

Now, we simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{306}{20} = 15.3 \]

Therefore, the group should order 15.3 pizzas. Since they can't order a fraction of a pizza, they should round up to ensure everyone gets enough.

So, each box contains \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a dozen cookies.

John bought 2 boxes, so we multiply the number of dozens in one box by 2:

The total capacity of the box is 6 gallons. We need to find 16/17 of 6 gallons.

First, we set up the calculation:
\[
\frac{16}{17} \times 6
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[
\frac{16 \times 6}{17} = \frac{96}{17}

Now, we divide 96 by 17 to get the result:

\[ \frac{4}{9} \times 5.6 \]

We can simplify this calculation by multiplying the numerator (4) by 5.6 and then dividing by the denominator (9):

So, Mary gives away approximately 2.49 marbles.

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
13 \times 14 = 182

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
10 \times 11 = 110

So, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{182}{110}

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 182 and 110. The prime factorization of 182 is \(2 \times 7 \times 13\), and the prime factorization of 110 is \(2 \times 5 \times 11\). The common factor is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 2:

- Mathew needs \( \frac{16}{7} \) feet of blocks.

To find the total length, we multiply these two fractions:
\[ \frac{16}{18} \times \frac{16}{7} \]

First, multiply the numerators:
\[ 16 \times 16 = 256 \]

Next, multiply the denominators:
\[ 18 \times 7 = 126 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{256}{126} \]

Now, we simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 256 and 126. The GCD of 256 and 126 is 2.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
\[ \frac{256 \div 2}{126 \div 2} = \frac{128}{63} \]

Thus, the total length of the blocks in feet is:
\[ \frac{128}{63} \]

        In light of the previous scenario, suppose Mathew decides to modify the length of the blocks he is using. Instead of each block being 16/18th of a foot long, he thinks having each block as 18/18th (a full foot) long would make his craft project more appealing. If he still needs 16/7th of a foot long blocks for his project, how long in feet would the blocks be in total this time?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the total length of the blocks Mathew has, we need to multiply the number of blocks by the length of each block.

Given:
- Each block is now \( \frac{18}{18} \) feet long, which simplifies to 1 foot.
- Mathew needs \( \frac{16}{7} \) feet of blocks.

To find the total length, we multiply these two values:

        A recipe for apple pie requires 10 apples. However, you only have two thirds of the amount needed. How many apples do you have if you multiply 10 apples by 4/6?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many apples you have, you need to multiply the number of apples required by the fraction representing the amount you have.

The recipe requires 10 apples, and you have two-thirds of that amount. Two-thirds can be represented as the fraction \(\frac{2}{3}\).

First, we convert the fraction \(\frac{2}{3}\) to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6 to match the given fraction \(\frac{4}{6}\). Notice that \(\frac{2}{3}\) is already equivalent to \(\frac{4}{6}\) because:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \times 2}{3 \times 2} = \frac{4}{6}
\]

Now, we multiply the number of apples required by this fraction:

\[
10 \times \frac{4}{6} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3}
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{10 \times 2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67
\]

So, you have approximately 6.67 apples.

The original production rate is 16 pizzas per hour. The new production rate is increased by \( \frac{12}{10} \) times. 

First, we calculate the new production rate:

\[
\text{New production rate} = 16 \times \frac{12}{10} = 16 \times 1.2 = 19.2 \text{ pizzas per hour}

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the result of multiplying 13 by \( \frac{3}{15} \), we follow these steps:

1. First, simplify the fraction \( \frac{3}{15} \):
   \[
   \frac{3}{15} = \frac{3 \div 3}{15 \div 3} = \frac{1}{5}
   \]

2. Next, multiply 13 by \( \frac{1}{5} \):
   \[
   13 \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{13 \times 1}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

3. Convert \( \frac{13}{5} \) to a decimal if needed:
   \[
   \frac{13}{5} = 2.6
   \]

So, the result can be expressed as either a fraction or a decimal.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many boxes Tom's friends will receive in total, we need to multiply the number of boxes Tom has by the fraction each friend will receive.

Tom has 13 boxes, and each friend will receive \( \frac{12}{13} \) of a box. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
13 \times \frac{12}{13}
\]

When multiplying, the 13 in the numerator and the 13 in the denominator cancel each other out:

\[
12 \times \frac{9}{15}

To simplify the fraction \( \frac{9}{15} \), we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

\[
\frac{9}{15} = \frac{9 \div 3}{15 \div 3} = \frac{3}{5}

Now, we multiply 12 by \( \frac{3}{5} \):

\[
12 \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{12 \times 3}{5} = \frac{36}{5} = 7.2

Now, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{360}{42} \). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 360 and 42, which is 6. We then divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

\[ \frac{360 \div 6}{42 \div 6} = \frac{60}{7} \]

Thus, the simplified fraction is \( \frac{60}{7} \).

Alternatively, we can convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division:

\[ \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.5714286 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many papers John has graded, we need to calculate \( \frac{8}{18} \) of the total pile of 20 assignment papers.

First, simplify the fraction \( \frac{8}{18} \):
\[ \frac{8}{18} = \frac{4}{9} \]

Next, calculate \( \frac{4}{9} \) of 20:
\[ \frac{4}{9} \times 20 = \frac{4 \times 20}{9} = \frac{80}{9} \]

Now, divide 80 by 9 to find the number of papers:
\[ \frac{80}{9} \approx 8.89 \]

Since John cannot grade a fraction of a paper, we round to the nearest whole number:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the result of multiplying 16 by the fraction \( \frac{13}{12} \), we follow these steps:

1. Write the multiplication expression:
   \[

2. Convert 16 to a fraction by writing it as \( \frac{16}{1} \):
   \[

   \]

3. Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
   \[
   \frac{16 \times 13}{1 \times 12} = \frac{208}{12}

4. Simplify the fraction \( \frac{208}{12} \):
   - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 208 and 12, which is 4.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
     \[
     \frac{208 \div 4}{12 \div 4} = \frac{52}{3}

5. The fraction \( \frac{52}{3} \) can also be expressed as a mixed number:
   - Divide 52 by 3 to get 17 with a remainder of 1:
     \[
     52 \div 3 = 17 \text{ R } 1

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of clay Albert will need, we need to multiply the amount of clay per model by the number of models he plans to create.

The amount of clay per model is \( \frac{8}{7} \) pounds.
The number of models he wants to create is \( \frac{17}{3} \).

We multiply these two fractions:

\[
\frac{8}{7} \times \frac{17}{3}
\]

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{8 \times 17}{7 \times 3} = \frac{136}{21}

First, simplify the fraction \(\frac{14}{16}\):

Now, substitute \(\frac{7}{8}\) back into the formula:

\[ p = 5 \times \frac{7}{8} \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine how many scoops are needed with the new scoop size of \(\frac{17}{19}\) of a normal cup, we will use the formula:

\[ k = \left( \frac{17}{19} \right) \times p \]

From the previous question, we found that \( p = 4 \frac{3}{8} \) scoops. First, convert \( 4 \frac{3}{8} \) to an improper fraction:

\[ 4 \frac{3}{8} = \frac{4 \times 8 + 3}{8} = \frac{32 + 3}{8} = \frac{35}{8} \]

Now, substitute \(\frac{35}{8}\) for \( p \) in the formula:

\[ k = \left( \frac{17}{19} \right) \times \frac{35}{8} \]

Multiply the fractions:

\[ k = \frac{17 \times 35}{19 \times 8} = \frac{595}{152} \]

To convert \(\frac{595}{152}\) into a mixed number, perform the division:

\[ 595 \div 152 \approx 3.914 \]

So, \(\frac{595}{152}\) can be expressed as:

Julia needs to make \( \frac{9}{13} \) of the recipe, so we multiply \( \frac{3}{2} \) by \( \frac{9}{13} \):

The total amount of flour required is 12 cups. Julia's sister needs to make \( \frac{9}{13} \) of the recipe, so we multiply 12 by \( \frac{9}{13} \):

\[ 12 \times \frac{9}{13} = \frac{12 \times 9}{13} = \frac{108}{13} \]

Simplifying \( \frac{108}{13} \):

Next, we convert the improper fraction \(\frac{180}{11}\) to a mixed number. We do this by dividing 180 by 11:

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{4}{5}\):

\[
\frac{180}{11} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{180 \times 4}{11 \times 5} = \frac{720}{55}

Now, we simplify \(\frac{720}{55}\). We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 720 and 55. The GCD of 720 and 55 is 5.

We divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the new output, we take the previous answer, which was 9, and multiply it by the fraction \( \frac{13}{18} \).

First, we write the multiplication as follows:

Next, we can simplify this by converting 9 to a fraction:
\[ \frac{9}{1} \times \frac{13}{18} \]

Now, we multiply the numerators and the denominators:
\[ \frac{9 \times 13}{1 \times 18} = \frac{117}{18} \]

To simplify \( \frac{117}{18} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 117 and 18, which is 9. We then divide both the numerator and the denominator by 9:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously found that \( f = \frac{289}{260} \).

Now, we need to multiply \( f \) by \( \frac{12}{11} \):

\[ f \times \frac{12}{11} = \frac{289}{260} \times \frac{12}{11} \]

To perform the multiplication, we multiply the numerators and the denominators:

1. Multiply the numerators:
\[ 289 \times 12 = 3468 \]

2. Multiply the denominators:
\[ 260 \times 11 = 2860 \]

So, the product is:
\[ \frac{3468}{2860} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{3468}{2860} \). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3468 and 2860.

- The prime factorization of 3468 is \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 17 \times 17 \).
- The prime factorization of 2860 is \( 2^2 \times 5 \times 11 \times 13 \).

The common factors are \( 2^2 = 4 \).

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4:

\[ \frac{3468 \div 4}{2860 \div 4} = \frac{867}{715} \]

Since 867 and 715 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction \( \frac{867}{715} \) is in its simplest form.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the multiplication of the fractions \( \frac{16}{20} \) and \( \frac{17}{13} \), we follow these steps:

1. Multiply the numerators:
\[ 16 \times 17 = 272 \]

2. Multiply the denominators:
\[ 20 \times 13 = 260 \]

So, the product of the fractions is:
\[ \frac{272}{260} \]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{272}{260} \). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 272 and 260.

- The prime factorization of 272 is \( 2^4 \times 17 \).
- The prime factorization of 260 is \( 2^2 \times 5 \times 13 \).

The common factors are \( 2^2 = 4 \).

Now, divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 4:
\[ \frac{272 \div 4}{260 \div 4} = \frac{68}{65} \]

Since 68 and 65 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction \( \frac{68}{65} \) is in its simplest form.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply the mixed number \(5 \frac{5}{12}\) by \(\frac{14}{14}\), we first recognize that \(\frac{14}{14}\) is equivalent to 1. Multiplying any number by 1 does not change its value. However, for the sake of clarity, let's go through the steps:

1. Convert the mixed number \(5 \frac{5}{12}\) to an improper fraction:
   \[
   5 \frac{5}{12} = \frac{5 \times 12 + 5}{12} = \frac{60 + 5}{12} = \frac{65}{12}
   \]

2. Multiply the improper fraction by \(\frac{14}{14}\):
   \[
   \frac{65}{12} \times \frac{14}{14} = \frac{65 \times 14}{12 \times 14} = \frac{910}{168}
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction \(\frac{910}{168}\):
   - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 910 and 168. The GCD is 14.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 14:
     \[
     \frac{910 \div 14}{168 \div 14} = \frac{65}{12}
     \]

4. Convert the improper fraction \(\frac{65}{12}\) back to a mixed number:
   \[
   65 \div 12 = 5 \quad \text{(remainder 5)}
   \]
   - The remainder is 5, so the fraction part is \(\frac{5}{12}\).

5. Combine the whole number part and the fraction part:

   \]

2. Convert the improper fraction \(\frac{65}{10}\) to a mixed number:
   - Divide 65 by 10 to find the whole number part:
     \[
     65 \div 10 = 6 \quad \text{(remainder 5)}

4. Combine the whole number part and the simplified fraction part:
   \[

When we use \(\frac{13}{10}\) instead of \(\frac{13}{12}\), the result increases because \(\frac{13}{10}\) is greater than \(\frac{13}{12}\). Specifically, the result changes from \(5 \frac{5}{12}\) to \(6 \frac{1}{2}\).

\[
\frac{3}{4} \div \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{1} = 3

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 17 = \frac{3 \times 17}{4} = \frac{51}{4} = 12.75

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each box contains 12 pieces of chocolate.
2. Each piece of chocolate is split into 8 equal parts for tasting.
3. We have 6 boxes of chocolates.

First, we need to determine how many whole pieces of chocolate are in one box when each piece is split into 8 parts. Since each piece is split into 8 parts, we can write the equation for one box as:
\[ \text{Whole pieces per box} = \frac{12}{8} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of whole pieces for 6 boxes. Using the given equation:
\[ t = 6 \times \left( \frac{12}{8} \right) \]

Let's calculate this step-by-step:
\[ \frac{12}{8} = 1.5 \]
\[ t = 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the final result, we need to multiply the result of \( 5 \times \left(\frac{14}{10}\right) \) by the fraction \( \frac{5}{6} \).

From the previous calculation, we know:
\[ 5 \times \left(\frac{14}{10}\right) = 7 \]

Now, we need to multiply 7 by \( \frac{5}{6} \):
\[ 7 \times \frac{5}{6} \]

To perform this multiplication, we multiply the numerator by the whole number and keep the denominator the same:
\[ \frac{7 \times 5}{6} = \frac{35}{6} \]

The fraction \( \frac{35}{6} \) can be left as an improper fraction or converted to a mixed number. To convert it to a mixed number:
\[ 35 \div 6 = 5 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
So,
\[ \frac{35}{6} = 5 \frac{5}{6} \]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the multiplication of a whole number and a fraction, we follow the same steps as before:

1. Multiply the whole number by the numerator of the fraction.
2. Divide the result by the denominator of the fraction.

Given:
\[ 5 \times \left(\frac{14}{13}\right) \]

Step 1: Multiply the whole number by the numerator:
\[ 5 \times 14 = 70 \]

Step 2: Divide the result by the denominator:
\[ \frac{70}{13} \]

To express this as a mixed number, we perform the division:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to multiply the result of \( 6 \times \frac{20}{7} \), which we found to be \( 17 \frac{1}{7} \), by \( \frac{10}{10} \).

1. Recall that multiplying by \( \frac{10}{10} \) is equivalent to multiplying by 1, so the value should remain the same. However, let's perform the multiplication step-by-step for clarity.

2. Convert the mixed number \( 17 \frac{1}{7} \) back to an improper fraction:
   \[
   17 \frac{1}{7} = \frac{17 \times 7 + 1}{7} = \frac{119 + 1}{7} = \frac{120}{7}
   \]

3. Multiply \( \frac{120}{7} \) by \( \frac{10}{10} \):
   \[
   \frac{120}{7} \times \frac{10}{10} = \frac{120 \times 10}{7 \times 10} = \frac{1200}{70}
   \]

4. Simplify the fraction \( \frac{1200}{70} \):
   - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1200 and 70, which is 10.
   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 10:
     \[
     \frac{1200 \div 10}{70 \div 10} = \frac{120}{7}
     \]

5. Convert the simplified improper fraction \( \frac{120}{7} \) back to a mixed number:
   \[
   120 \div 7 = 17 \text{ R } 1 \quad \text{so} \quad \frac{120}{7} = 17 \frac{1}{7}

2. Convert the improper fraction \( \frac{15}{8} \) to a mixed number:
   - Divide 15 by 8 to get the quotient and the remainder:
     \[
     15 \div 8 = 1 \text{ R } 7

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the length of each piece that Jack cuts from the sheet. The total length of the sheet is given as \( \frac{5}{15} \) meters.

To find the length of each piece, we divide the total length by the number of pieces:
\[
\text{Length of each piece} = \frac{5}{15} \div 9
\]

Dividing by 9 is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of 9, which is \( \frac{1}{9} \):
\[
\frac{5}{15} \div 9 = \frac{5}{15} \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{5 \times 1}{15 \times 9} = \frac{5}{135}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{5}{135} \):
\[
\frac{5}{135} = \frac{1}{27}
\]

So, the length of each piece is \( \frac{1}{27} \) meters.

Now, we need to find the total length of all 9 pieces:
\[
\text{Total length} = 9 \times \frac{1}{27} = \frac{9}{27}
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{9}{27} \):
\[
\frac{9}{27} = \frac{1}{3}

Therefore, the total length of all 9 pieces is \( \frac{1}{3} \) meters.

        Susan bought 9 apples. She used 15/16 of those apples to make a big apple pie for her family. What fraction of the total apples did Susan use?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the fraction of the total apples Susan used, we start with the information that she bought 9 apples and used \( \frac{15}{16} \) of those apples.

First, we calculate the number of apples Susan used:
\[ \text{Number of apples used} = 9 \times \frac{15}{16} \]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 9 \times \frac{15}{16} = \frac{9 \times 15}{16} = \frac{135}{16} \]

Since \( \frac{135}{16} \) represents the number of apples used, we need to express this as a fraction of the total apples (9 apples). To do this, we divide the number of apples used by the total number of apples:
\[ \text{Fraction of total apples used} = \frac{\frac{135}{16}}{9} \]

Simplify the division:
\[ \frac{\frac{135}{16}}{9} = \frac{135}{16} \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{135}{144} \]

Next, we simplify \( \frac{135}{144} \) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 135 and 144. The GCD of 135 and 144 is 9.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 9:
\[ \frac{135 \div 9}{144 \div 9} = \frac{15}{16} \]

Thus, the fraction of the total apples Susan used is:

        In a class, 10 out of 14 students participated in a school project. Each of those students prepared 8 models for the science fair. Calculate the total number of models prepared for the science fair by multiplying the fraction of students who participated (10/14) with the number of models each student made (8).
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to determine the fraction of students who participated in the school project. This fraction is given by:

\[
\frac{10}{14}
\]

Next, we simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

\[
\frac{10 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Now, we multiply this fraction by the number of models each student made, which is 8:

\[
\frac{5}{7} \times 8
\]

To perform this multiplication, we multiply the numerator by 8 and keep the denominator the same:

\[
\frac{5 \times 8}{7} = \frac{40}{7}
\]

This fraction represents the total number of models prepared. To convert this to a mixed number, we divide 40 by 7:

\[
40 \div 7 = 5 \text{ remainder } 5
\]

So, 

\[
\frac{40}{7} = 5 \frac{5}{7}
\]

However, since we are looking for the total number of models, we should consider the integer part of the fraction. Each student made 8 models, and 10 students participated, so:

\[
10 \times 8 = 80
\]

Thus, the total number of models prepared for the science fair is:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's convert the mixed number \( 13 \frac{1}{4} \) to an improper fraction. 

The mixed number \( 13 \frac{1}{4} \) can be written as:
\[ 13 \frac{1}{4} = 13 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{13 \times 4}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{52}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{52 + 1}{4} = \frac{53}{4} \]

Next, we multiply the fraction \( \frac{3}{3} \) by the improper fraction \( \frac{53}{4} \):
\[ \frac{3}{3} \times \frac{53}{4} = \frac{3 \times 53}{3 \times 4} = \frac{159}{12} \]

Now, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{159}{12} \). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 159 and 12. 

The prime factorization of 159 is:
\[ 159 = 3 \times 53 \]

The prime factorization of 12 is:
\[ 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \]

The common factor is 3. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[ \frac{159 \div 3}{12 \div 3} = \frac{53}{4} \]

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

Next, we simplify the fraction:

We can simplify \(\frac{228}{14}\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 228 and 14, which is 2:

\frac{1}{6} \times 14 = \frac{14}{6}
\]

We can simplify \(\frac{14}{6}\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

\[
\frac{14 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{7}{3}
\]

So, the simplified fraction is \(\frac{7}{3}\). As a decimal, this is approximately:

\[
\frac{7}{3} \approx 2.3333
\]

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result when \( \frac{5}{14} \) of a whole is multiplied by 18, we perform the following multiplication:

\[
\frac{5}{14} \times 18
\]

First, we multiply the numerator (5) by 18:

\[
5 \times 18 = 90
\]

Next, we divide the result by the denominator (14):

\[
\frac{90}{14}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{90}{14} \), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 90 and 14, which is 2. We then divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

\[
\frac{90 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{45}{7}
\]

Thus, the result is \( \frac{45}{7} \).

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We already found that \( \frac{5}{14} \times 18 = \frac{45}{7} \).

Now, we need to multiply this result by \( \frac{9}{7} \):

\[
\frac{45}{7} \times \frac{9}{7}
\]

To multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

\[
\frac{45 \times 9}{7 \times 7} = \frac{405}{49}
\]

Thus, the result of multiplying \( \frac{45}{7} \) by \( \frac{9}{7} \) is \( \frac{405}{49} \).

        If instead of 18, we had 17 wholes, what would be the result of multiplying 5/14 of a whole by 17?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result when \( \frac{5}{14} \) of a whole is multiplied by 17, we perform the following multiplication:

\[
\frac{5}{14} \times 17
\]

First, we multiply the numerator (5) by 17:

\[
5 \times 17 = 85
\]

Next, we divide the result by the denominator (14):

\[
\frac{85}{14}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{85}{14} \), we check if there is a common divisor for 85 and 14. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 85 and 14 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{85}{14} \).

So, the product is:
\[

Next, we simplify \(\frac{55}{40}\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 55 and 40. The GCD of 55 and 40 is 5.

3. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:
