Perimeter = 2m + 667m + x

where x is the length of the third side.

We are given that the perimeter is 997m, so we can set up the equation:

2m + 667m + x = 997

Simplifying the equation:

2m + 667m + x = 997

2m + 667m = 997 - x

2m + 667m = 997 - x

Subtracting 2m from both sides:

667m = 997 - x - 2m

Subtracting 667m from both sides:

-2m = 997 - x - 667m

Adding 667m to both sides:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is given as 503 meters.

Let's call the length of the remaining side &quot;x&quot; meters. Then, the perimeter of the triangle can be calculated as follows:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

Since we know that one side of the triangle is 223 meters long and another side is 46 meters long, we can write:

Perimeter = 223 + 46 + x

We are also given that the perimeter of the triangle is 503 meters, so we can substitute this value into the equation above:

503 = 223 + 46 + x

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 223 and 46 from both sides of the equation:

x = 503 - 223 - 46
x = 254

Therefore, the length of the remaining side of the triangle is 254 meters.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The formula for the perimeter of a triangle is P = a + b + c, where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides. Since we know the perimeter is 898m, we can set up the equation:

P = a + b + c

We know that a = 250m and b = 435m, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

P = 250 + 435 + c

We also know that c is the length of the third side of the triangle, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

P = 250 + 435 + c

We can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

P = 685 + c

We know that P = 898m, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

898 = 685 + c

We can subtract 685 from both sides of the equation to solve for c:

c = 898 - 685

c = 213

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is given as 828 meters.

We know that two sides of the triangle are 105 and 434 meters long. Let's call the third side &quot;x&quot; meters long.

Using the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, we can set up the equation:

perimeter = a + b + c

where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

In this case, we know that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are 105 and 434 meters long, respectively. So, we can substitute these values into the equation:

perimeter = a + b + c
= 105 + 434 + x

We also know that the perimeter is 828 meters. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:

828 = 105 + 434 + x

Now, we can solve for &quot;x&quot; by subtracting 105 and 434 from both sides of the equation:

723 = x

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

Perimeter = 37 + 559 + x

where x is the length of the third side.

We know that the perimeter is 773 cm, so we can set up the equation:

37 + 559 + x = 773

Solving for x, we get:

x = 773 - 37 - 559 = -100

But we know that the length of a side cannot be negative, so there is no solution to this problem.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can help you with that!

Let's call the length of the third side &quot;x&quot;. We know that the perimeter of the garden is 792m, so we can write an equation using the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are the lengths of the sides of the triangle. In this case, we know that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are 147m and 590m, respectively, so we can write:

Perimeter = 147 + 590 + x

We also know that the perimeter of the garden is 792m, so we can substitute that value in:

792 = 147 + 590 + x

Now we can solve for &quot;x&quot; by subtracting 147 and 590 from both sides:

x = 792 - 147 - 590

x = 595

So the length of the third side of the triangle is 595m.</pre>

Let's call the length of the third side &quot;x&quot; meters. Then, the perimeter of the triangle can be written as:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are the lengths of the three sides.

We know that one of the sides is 321 meters long, and another is 528 meters long. So, we can write:

We also know that the perimeter is 871 meters, so we can substitute that value in:

We know that two sides of the triangle measure 424m and 246m respectively. Let's call the length of the third side &quot;x&quot;.

Using the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, we can write:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

In this case, we have:

Perimeter = 424 + 246 + x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

991 = 424 + 246 + x

Subtracting 424 and 246 from both sides, we get:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is given as 919m.

We know that one of the sides is 350m long and the other side is 154m long. Let's call the length of the third side &quot;x&quot;.

We can write an equation using the information given:

Perimeter = 350 + 154 + x

Simplifying the equation:

919 = 350 + 154 + x

Subtracting 350 and 154 from both sides:

569 = x

Therefore, the length of the third side is 569m.

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

We know that the perimeter is 989m, and we know that two of the sides are 128m and 288m long, so we can set up the equation:

989 = a + b + c

Solving for c, we get:

c = 989 - (a + b)

Substituting the values we know, we get:

c = 989 - (128 + 288)

c = 989 - 416

c = 573

We know that the perimeter is 850m, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

850 = 57 + 426 + x

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 57 and 426 from both sides of the equation:

x = 850 - 57 - 426

x = 747

Let's call the length of the third side &quot;x&quot;. Then, the perimeter of the triangle can be written as:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides.

Since we know the lengths of two sides (315m and 100m), we can substitute those values into the equation above:

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting the sum of the two known sides from the given perimeter:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides. We also know that the sum of two of the sides is equal to 472m, so we can write:

a + b = 472

Now, we can substitute the value of a + b into the first equation and solve for c:

Perimeter = a + b + c
Perimeter = a + b + (784 - a - b)

Now, we can solve for c:

c = 784 - a - b

Now, we can substitute the value of a + b into the second equation and solve for a:

a + b = 472
a = 472 - b

Now, we can substitute the value of a into the third equation and solve for b:

c = 784 - (472 - b) - b
c = 784 - 472 + b
c = 292 + b

Now, we can substitute the value of b into the fourth equation and solve for b:

292 + b = 784 - a
292 + b = 784 - (472 - b)
292 + b = 472 + b
292 = b

Now, we can substitute the value of b into the fifth equation and solve for a:

a = 472 - b
a = 472 - 292
a = 180

Now, we can substitute the value of a into the sixth equation and solve for c:

c = 784 - a - b
c = 784 - 180 - 292
c = 212

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 212m.</pre>

The first side has a length of 287m, and the second side has a length of 475m. The third side can be found by using the formula for the perimeter of a triangle: P = a + b + c, where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides.

Plugging in the values given, we get:

P = 287 + 475 + c

Simplifying, we get:

P = 762 + c

Since the perimeter is given as 867m, we can set up the equation:

762 + c = 867

Subtracting 762 from both sides, we get:

c = 105

Perimeter = 3x

where x is the length of each side.

We know that the perimeter is 894 inches, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

894 = 3x

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 3:

x = 894 / 3

x = 298

We know that two sides of the triangle are 122 meters and 245 meters long, respectively. Let's call these sides &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.

We can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, which is:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where &quot;c&quot; is the length of the third side.

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

Perimeter = 122 + 245 + c

Simplifying, we get:

Perimeter = 367 + c

Since we know that the perimeter is 762 meters, we can set up the equation:

367 + c = 762

Subtracting 367 from both sides, we get:

c = 762 - 367

c = 395

where x is the length of the remaining side.

We know that the perimeter is 248m, so we can set up the equation:

186 + 37 + x = 248

Solving for x, we get:

x = 248 - 186 - 37 = 24

Therefore, the length of the remaining side is 24m.

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

We are given that the perimeter is 739 meters, and we know that two of the sides are 180 meters and 338 meters respectively. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the equation:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

In this case, we know that the perimeter is 568m, and we know that the lengths of two of the sides are 110m and 205m. So, we can set up the equation:

568 = a + b + c

where a is the length of the side opposite the angle that is not 110m, and b is the length of the side opposite the angle that is not 205m.

Solving for c, we get:

c = 568 - (a + b)

Substituting the values we know, we get:

c = 568 - (110 + 205)

c = 568 - 315

c = 253

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is given as 633 meters.

Let's call the length of the third side &quot;x&quot; meters.

The perimeter of the triangle can be calculated as follows:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

Since we know that the length of one side is 325 meters and the length of the other side is 15 meters, we can write:

Perimeter = 325 + 15 + x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Perimeter = 340 + x

Since we know that the perimeter is 633 meters, we can substitute this value into the equation:

633 = 340 + x

Subtracting 340 from both sides gives us:

x = 293

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The formula for the perimeter of a triangle is P = a + b + c, where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides.

In this case, the perimeter of the triangle is 907m, and the lengths of the two sides are 464m and 377m, respectively.

We can set up an equation using the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:

P = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides.

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

P = 464 + 377 + c

Simplifying, we get:

P = 841 + c

Since the perimeter of the triangle is 907m, we can set up an equation to solve for c:

841 + c = 907

Subtracting 841 from both sides, we get:

c = 166

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: An equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length. Therefore, the length of each side is equal to half of the perimeter.

Perimeter = 3x

x = 966/3 = 322

Each side of the equilateral triangle has a length of 322m.

### Answer: 322m</pre>
