1. Sally initially traveled 47/50 of a mile, which is equal to 0.94 miles.
2. She then gained confidence and traveled another 31 miles, which is equal to 31 miles.
3. For the next 28 days, she completed the same distance, which is equal to 28 x 0.94 miles = 26.32 miles.
4. She decided to detour and added an extra 32/24 miles to her regular bike route, which is equal to 32/24 x 0.94 miles = 0.94 miles.
5. The total distance traveled by Sally is the sum of the initial distance, the extra distance, and the total distance traveled for the next 28 days, which is equal to 0.94 + 31 + 26.32 + 0.94 = 68.26 miles.

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 13B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The truck can travel a distance of 34/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel.

To find the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel, we need to find the number of liters of fuel required to travel the additional 11 kilometers.

11 kilometers / 34/25 kilometers per liter = 11/34 = 0.3125 liters

Therefore, the truck can travel 34/25 kilometers + 11/34 kilometers = 34/25 kilometers + 0.3125 kilometers = 34.3125 kilometers before running out of fuel.

To find the total distance the truck can travel after adding an additional 49 kilometers to the journey, we need to find the number of liters of fuel required to travel the additional 49 kilometers.

49 kilometers / 34/25 kilometers per liter = 49/34 = 1.4286 liters

Therefore, the truck can travel 34.3125 kilometers + 1.4286 kilometers = 35.7411 kilometers before running out of fuel.

            John drank a special energy drink that increased his jogging speed. After the energy drink, he was able to jog 50/49 miles per hour faster. One day, he had a speed of 4/22 miles per hour without the use of the energy drink. After consuming the energy drink, at what rate would he jog if he continued for 46/30 hours?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 13B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's first find the speed increase caused by the energy drink. We know that the energy drink increased his speed by 50/49 miles per hour, so we can set up the equation:

Speed with energy drink = Speed without energy drink + (Speed without energy drink x 50/49)

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

Speed with energy drink = Speed without energy drink + (Speed without energy drink x 1.25)

Now, we know that John's speed without the energy drink is 4/22 miles per hour, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

Speed with energy drink = 4/22 + (4/22 x 1.25)

Simplifying the equation:

Speed with energy drink = 4/22 + 1.25

Solving for the speed with energy drink:

Speed with energy drink = 5.25/22

Now, we know that John continued to jog for 46/30 hours. We can set up the equation:

Total distance jogged = Speed with energy drink x Time

Substituting the value we found earlier:

Total distance jogged = 5.25/22 x 46/30

Simplifying the equation:

Total distance jogged = 2.31 miles

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The truck driver starts with 9 gallons of gas in his tank.
He adds 21/36 gallons of gas to his tank at the first station, so he now has 9 + (21/36) = 9 + 3/6 = 11/6 gallons of gas.
He adds 26/42 gallons of gas to his tank at the second station, so he now has 11/6 + (26/42) = 11/6 + 26/42 = 37/24 gallons of gas.

Therefore, the truck driver has 37/24 gallons of gas in his tank now.

Every week, John can save 20/48 of the money he needs, which is $20/48 = $4.

After a certain period of time, John decides to put all his savings so far into an investment account. The account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested after a year.

Let's assume that John has saved $x after a year.

The investment account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested, so the return on investment is $41/11 \* $x.

We know that John has saved $x after a year, so the total amount of money in the investment account is $x + $41/11 \* $x.

Simplifying, we get $x + $41/11 \* $x = $x(1 + $41/11) = $x(11/11) = $x.

Therefore, John will have $x in his investment account after a year.

            Jennifer is selling lemonade for a fundraiser. Every jug she sells contains 21 gallons of lemonade. Due to evaporation, when she sells the jugs she only receives 31/34 of the volume she originally had. How much lemonade does Jennifer have after selling a full jug?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 13B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's say Jennifer has x jugs of lemonade.

Each jug contains 21 gallons of lemonade, so the total volume of lemonade Jennifer has is 21x gallons.

When she sells the jugs, she only receives 31/34 of the volume she originally had, so the total volume of lemonade she receives is 31/34(21x) gallons.

Let's simplify this expression:

31/34(21x) = 31x/34

Now, we can solve for x:

31x/34 = 21x

Multiply both sides by 34:

31x = 21x(34)

Combine like terms:

31x = 692

Divide both sides by 31:

x = 692/31

x = 22

So, Jennifer has 22 jugs of lemonade after selling a full jug.

Let's first find the total time Tom spent moving the rocks:

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 13B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's first find the total volume of juice in the two containers:

Container 1: 23/35 gallon = 23/35 \* 1 gallon = 7/15 gallon

Container 2: 50/41 gallon = 50/41 \* 1 gallon = 12 7/15 gallon

Total volume of juice: 7/15 gallon + 12 7/15 gallon = 19 3/15 gallon

Now, let's find the volume of juice that was transferred into the bottle:

19 3/15 gallon \* 28 gallon = 502 2/5 gallon

Now, let's find the volume of juice that was drunk by the customer:

11/19 gallon \* 502 2/5 gallon = 61 11/15 gallon

Now, let's find the volume of space left in the bottle:

502 2/5 gallon - 61 11/15 gallon = 441 13/15 gallon

Therefore, there is 441 13/15 gallon of space left in the bottle after subtracting 11/19 gallon which was drunk by the customer.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the distance the drone can fly without the package &quot;x&quot; and the distance it can fly with the package &quot;y&quot;.

We know that the drone can fly 3 kilometers without the package, so x = 3.

We also know that the drone can fly 50/43 kilometers less with the package, so y = 3 - (50/43) = 3 - 12.5 = 10.5 kilometers.

When the drone is attached with an additional booster, it can fly an additional 47/15 kilometers, so the total distance it can fly is x + y + (47/15) = 3 + 10.5 + 3.14 = 17.64 kilometers.

Therefore, the drone can fly 17.64 kilometers with the package and the additional booster attached.

Let's first find the total amount of money Alex has:

$13/10 + $47/36 = $60/36

Now, if we want to duplicate the amount of money Alex has by 43 times, we can multiply the total amount by 43:

$60/36 x 43 = $252/36

So, Alex will have a total of $252/36 = $7.25 after duplicating the amount of money he has by 43 times.

            John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days. He began noticing that his apples lasts about as long as 48 ounces of apple juice, which he happens to consume every 42 days. Calculate the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption.

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 13B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let x be the rate of John's apple consumption in pounds per day.

Let y be the rate of John's apple juice consumption in ounces per day.

Since John's apples last as long as 48 ounces of apple juice, we can set up the equation:

x/y = 48

We know that John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days, so we can set up the equation:

x = 17/8

We also know that John consumes 42 days of apple juice every 8 days, so we can set up the equation:

y = 42/8

Now we can substitute the values of x and y into the first equation:

(17/8)/(42/8) = 48

Simplifying, we get:

17/42 = 48

Simplifying further, we get:

17 = 42 x 48

17 = 1928

Therefore, John's apple to apple juice consumption rate is 1928:1.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 13B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

1. Maria drove for 8 hours at a speed of 4/7 miles per hour, so she traveled a total distance of 8 hours x 4/7 miles per hour = 48 miles.
2. Maria initially had 38 dollars for gas, but spent 50/4 dollars on gas, so she spent a total of 50/4 dollars = 12.50 dollars on gas.
3. The remaining amount of money Maria had for gas is 38 - 12.50 = 25.50 dollars.

Therefore, the summation of the total miles Maria drove and the remaining amount of money she had for gas is:

Total miles driven = 48 miles
Remaining amount of money for gas = 25.50 dollars

### Answer: 48 miles and 25.50 dollars.</pre>

Let the distance from the village to the well be x miles.

After 1 hour, the donkey can carry water back from the well, effectively reducing the distance by 18/33 miles.

So, the effective distance of the well from the village after 1 hour is x - 18/33 miles.

Substituting x with 45 miles, we get:

x - 18/33 miles = 45 - 18/33 miles

Simplifying, we get:

x - 18/33 miles = 27 miles

So, the effective distance of the well from the village after 1 hour is 27 miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's first find the total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after it loads all 39 containers. We can do this by multiplying the number of containers by the tonnage per container:

39 containers x 17/26 tons per container = 39 x 17/26 = 39 x 0.65 = 24.35 tons

Now, we need to add the existing cargo load of 50/11 tons to the total tonnage:

24.35 tons + 50/11 tons = 24.35 tons + 4.55 tons = 28.9 tons

Therefore, the total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after it loads all 39 containers is 28.9 tons.
