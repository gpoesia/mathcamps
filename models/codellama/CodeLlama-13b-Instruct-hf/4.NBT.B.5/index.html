        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The total size of the object with added magnification is the original size of the object plus the total amount of magnification.

The original size of the object is 1 unit.
The total amount of magnification is 67 magnifications x 86 units per magnification = 67 x 86 = 5,614 units.

Therefore, the total size of the object with added magnification is 1 + 5,614 = 5,615 units.
