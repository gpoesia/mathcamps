            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 13B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's start by defining the number of magical stones that Miny has at the beginning of the adventure, which is 1. We can represent this as a variable, a, and set it equal to 1.

Next, we know that Miny attends a fairy party where she receives 11 additional magical stones. We can represent this as a new variable, b, and set it equal to 11.

After the party, Miny collects 2 more magical stones on her way home. We can represent this as a new variable, c, and set it equal to 2.

Now, we can use the variables a, b, and c to find the total number of magical stones that Miny has. We can do this by adding the values of each variable together:

a + b + c = 1 + 11 + 2 = 14

Therefore, Miny has 14 magical stones in total.

Now, we are told that Miny has received 2 more magical stones in the mail. We can represent this as a new variable, d, and set it equal to 2.

So, the total number of magical stones that Miny has now is:
