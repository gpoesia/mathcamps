Total amount of water in the well = 4723.97 gallons
Number of tanks = 89.3

To divide the total amount of water by the number of tanks, we can use the following formula:

Gallons per tank = Total amount of water / Number of tanks

Gallons per tank = 4723.97 / 89.3
Gallons per tank = 52.5

Original cost of two boxes of pencils = $148.53
Additional cost of additional items = $148.53 x 16.39 = $256.02

New total cost = $148.53 + $256.02 = $404.55

Let's call the initial balance $x.

We know that the new balance will be $x + $3.0.

So, we can set up the equation:

$x + $3.0 = $87.48 + $3.0

Simplifying the equation:

$x + $3.0 = $90.48

Solving for $x:

$x = $90.48 - $3.0

$x = $87.48

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: If each city decides to double their energy received from the wind farm, they will receive twice the amount of energy they currently receive.

Each city currently receives 81.9 MWh of energy from the wind farm.

To find the new amount of energy each city will receive, we can multiply the current amount of energy by 2:

81.9 MWh x 2 = 163.8 MWh per city

Therefore, each city will receive 163.8 MWh of energy from the wind farm if they decide to double their energy received.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To equally distribute the gems, we need to divide the total number of gems by the number of knights.

Total number of gems = 3054.4
Number of knights = 33.2

To divide the gems equally, we can use the following formula:

Number of gems per knight = Total number of gems / Number of knights

Substituting the values, we get:

Number of gems per knight = 3054.4 / 33.2

Number of gems per knight = 91.6

3792.28 Ã· 45.2 = &lt;&lt;3792.28 Ã· 45.2=83.64&gt;&gt;83.64 beach balls per store.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The height of the original castle is 68.4 meters.
To find the height of the model, we need to multiply the height of the original castle by the scale factor (1 meter of the original castle corresponds to 27.69 mm of the model).

Height of the model = 68.4 meters x 27.69 mm/meter = 1877.2 mm

Therefore, the model of the castle will be 1877.2 mm tall.
