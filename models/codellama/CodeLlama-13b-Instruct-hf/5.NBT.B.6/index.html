        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The total distance traveled by the bus is 2496 miles.
The number of weeks the bus travels is 52 weeks.

To find the average distance traveled by the bus each week, we can divide the total distance traveled by the number of weeks:

2496 miles / 52 weeks = &lt;&lt;2496/52=47.25&gt;&gt;47.25 miles per week.

Let's call the length of each city's portion of the river &quot;x&quot; kilometers.

Since the river flows 902 kilometers through the country and passes through 82 cities, we can write the equation:

902 = 82x

To find the length of each city's portion of the river, we can divide both sides of the equation by 82:

x = 902/82

x = 10.75 kilometers

Therefore, each city's portion of the river is 10.75 kilometers long.</pre>

            A jeweler has 1944 pieces of beads and wants to create bracelets using an equal number of beads in each bracelet. If the jeweler ends up making 72 bracelets, how many beads does each bracelet have?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The jeweler has 1944 pieces of beads and wants to create 72 bracelets. To create 72 bracelets, each bracelet must have an equal number of beads.

Let's call the number of beads in each bracelet &quot;x&quot;. Since the jeweler wants to create 72 bracelets, we can set up the equation:

1944 = 72x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 72:

x = 1944 / 72

x = 26

So, each bracelet has 26 beads.

We can set up the equation:

15x â‰¤ 930

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 15:

x â‰¤ 62

So, the number of feathers in each pillow is less than or equal to 62.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the number of feathers in each pillow &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the second factory can fill 15 pillows, so the total number of feathers used is 15x.

We also know that the second factory has 5881 feathers available, so the total number of feathers used is less than or equal to 5881.

We can set up the equation:

15x â‰¤ 5881

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 15:

x â‰¤ 393

So, the number of feathers in each pillow is less than or equal to 393.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The slide is 728 inches long, and each wave is 56 inches apart. To find the number of waves, we can divide the length of the slide by the distance between each wave:

728 Ã· 56 = &lt;&lt;728/56=12.5&gt;&gt;12.5 waves

Therefore, there are 12.5 waves on the slide.</pre>
