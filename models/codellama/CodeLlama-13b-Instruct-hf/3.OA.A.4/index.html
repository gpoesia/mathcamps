            A king has decided to build a number of castles in his kingdom. If each castle requires 5 builders and there are 15 builders in total, how many castles are being built?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Each castle requires 5 builders, so the number of castles being built is equal to the total number of builders divided by the number of builders required for each castle.

Total number of builders = 15
Number of builders required for each castle = 5

Number of castles being built = Total number of builders / Number of builders required for each castle
= 15 / 5
= 3

Therefore, the king is building 3 castles.</pre>

            In a mega-sized tube of toothpaste, there are 77 grams of toothpaste. If each usage consumes 11 grams of toothpaste, how many usages can you get from this tube?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To find out how many usages can be made from the tube, we need to divide the total amount of toothpaste in the tube by the amount used in each usage.

Total amount of toothpaste in the tube = 77 grams
Amount used in each usage = 11 grams

Number of usages = Total amount of toothpaste in the tube / Amount used in each usage
Number of usages = 77 grams / 11 grams
Number of usages = 7

Therefore, the mega-sized tube of toothpaste can be used for 7 usages.

Let's call the number of sections &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the total number of children who can play on the gym at one time is 77.

We also know that each section allows for 7 children to play at once.

7x = 77

Solving for x, we get:

x = 11

Let's call the number of strawberries in one batch &quot;x&quot;. Then, the number of strawberries in each batch is x, x, and x.

So, the total number of strawberries in all three batches is:

x + x + x = 6

Simplifying the equation:

3x = 6

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 2

Therefore, there are 2 strawberries in one batch.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: If Linda doubles the quantity of one specific model, she will have 2 times the current number of dolls of that model.
Let's say the current number of dolls of that model is x.
Then, if Linda doubles the quantity, she will have 2x dolls of that model.
Since Linda has 2 dolls of that model, we can set up the equation:
2x = 2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 1
So, Linda currently has 1 doll of that specific model.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the number of play sections in the jungle gym &quot;x&quot;.

We know that each play section has 7 monkeys playing on it, so the total number of monkeys playing on all the play sections is 7x.

We also know that there are 35 monkeys in total.

So, we can set up the equation:

7x = 35

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 35/7

x = 5

So, there are 5 play sections in the jungle gym.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's call the number of door panels &quot;x&quot;. We know that each door panel weighs 5kg, so the total weight of all door panels is 5x. We are given that the total weight is 45kg, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 45/5

x = 9

Therefore, there are 9 door panels in the warehouse.

Since each gear can sell exactly 7 bicycles, the total number of bicycles that can be sold is 7x.

We know that Mountain Peak has 63 bicycles ready for sale, so we can set up the equation:

7x = 63

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 63/7

x = 9

Therefore, there are 9 gears in the new model of bicycle.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's say the compass maker sells x compasses each day. Since he sells 12 compasses each day, we can write an equation:

x + x + x + ... + x = 84

(where the addition sign is repeated x times)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x(x + 1) = 84

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9

So, the compass maker sold 9 compasses each day for a total of 84 compasses.

Let's call the number of lemons produced by each tree &quot;x&quot;.

We know that 6 trees can produce 60 lemons in total, so we can write an equation:

6x = 60

To find the average number of lemons produced by each tree, we can divide the total number of lemons by the number of trees:

Average number of lemons produced by each tree = 60 / 6 = 10

So, each tree produces 10 lemons on average.

Let's call the cost of each ring x dollars.
Then, the total cost of the 5 rings is 5x dollars.
We know that the total cost is 35 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
5x = 35
To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:
x = 35/5
x = 7
So, each ring costs 7 dollars.

            For an upcoming clothing sale, a store decides to discount their jackets. After the discount, each jacket costs 6 dollars. If the original price was &quot;d&quot; dollars and it's now 1/5th of its original price, what was the original price of the jacket?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the original price of the jacket &quot;d&quot;.

After the discount, each jacket costs 6 dollars. So, the discount is equal to the original price minus 6 dollars.

d - 6 = 0

Solving for d, we get:

d = 6

So, the original price of the jacket was 6 dollars.</pre>

            In a zoo, each giraffe eats 7 pounds of food each day. If the total amount of food consumed by the giraffes is 28 pounds today, how many giraffes are there in the zoo?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Each giraffe eats 7 pounds of food per day, so the total amount of food consumed by all the giraffes is 7 x number of giraffes = 28 pounds.
Solving for number of giraffes, we get:
number of giraffes = 28 / 7 = &lt;&lt;28/7=4&gt;&gt;4 giraffes.

            In a shallow pool, a group of 30 starfish decided to divide themselves equally to live in different zones of the pool. If each zone contains 6 starfish, how many zones are there in total?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To divide 30 starfish equally among 6 zones, each zone must contain 5 starfish.
Therefore, there are 30/5 = &lt;&lt;30/5=6&gt;&gt;6 zones in total.
