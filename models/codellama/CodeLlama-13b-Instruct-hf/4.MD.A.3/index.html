length = 4 \* width

We know that the longer side measures 39 meters, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

39 = 4 \* width

Now, we can solve for the width:

width = 39 / 4

width = 9.75 meters

Now that we have the width, we can find the area of the rectangle:

area = length \* width

area = 39 \* 9.75
