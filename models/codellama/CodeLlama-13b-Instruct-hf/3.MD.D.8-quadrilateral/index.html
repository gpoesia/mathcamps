        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangular swimming pool can be found by adding the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the perimeter is 324 meters.

The length of the pool is 83 meters.

The width of the pool can be found by using the formula: width = perimeter / length

Plugging in the values, we get: width = 324 / 83 = 3.94 meters

So, the width of the pool is approximately 3.94 meters.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Perimeter = Length of one side + Length of other side

We know that the perimeter is 194 cm, and the length of one side is 49 cm. So, we can substitute these values into the equation:

194 = 49 + Length of other side

Now, we can solve for the length of the other side:

Length of other side = 194 - 49
Length of other side = 145

Therefore, the length of the other side is 145 cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the length of the fourth side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 229m, so we can write an equation based on the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral:

P = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral.

We also know that two of the sides have lengths of 93m and 98m, so we can substitute those values into the equation:

P = 93 + 98 + x + d

We also know that the third side has a length of 36m, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

P = 93 + 98 + x + 36

Now we can solve for x:

P - 93 - 98 - 36 = x

229 - 93 - 98 - 36 = x

143 = x

So the length of the fourth side is 143m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the length of the fourth side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 227m, so we can write an equation based on the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral:

Perimeter = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides.

We also know that the lengths of three of the sides are 70m, 29m, and 61m, so we can substitute those values into the equation:

Perimeter = 70 + 29 + 61 + x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

227 = 70 + 29 + 61 + x

Subtracting 70 + 29 + 61 from both sides, we get:

x = 227 - 120

x = 107

Therefore, the length of the fourth side of the quadrilateral is 107m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the length of the fourth side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 219cm, so we can write an equation based on the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral:

P = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides.

We also know that two of the sides have lengths of 37cm and 98cm, so we can substitute those values into the equation:

P = 37 + 98 + x + d

We also know that one of the sides is 41cm, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

P = 37 + 98 + x + 41

Now we have two equations and two variables (x and d). We can solve for x and d by subtracting the two equations and solving for x:

P - P = 37 + 98 + x + 41 - (37 + 98 + x + d)

Simplifying the equation:

0 = 41 - d

Now we have an equation for d in terms of x:

d = 41 - x

Now we can substitute this value for d into the first equation and solve for x:

P = 37 + 98 + x + (41 - x)

Simplifying the equation:

P = 37 + 98 + x - x

Now we have an equation for x:

x = 37 + 98

x = 135

So the length of the fourth side is 135cm.

To find the length of one side of a square, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a square, which is:

Perimeter = 4s

We are given that the perimeter is 44m, so we can set up the equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Perimeter = a + b + a + b

where a is the length of the longer side and b is the length of the shorter side.

We know that the perimeter is 282 meters, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

282 = a + b + a + b

Simplifying the equation, we get:

282 = 2a + 2b

Subtracting 2a from both sides gives us:

282 - 2a = 2b

Subtracting 2b from both sides gives us:

282 - 2a - 2b = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2a + b = 141

Since we know that the longer side is 71 meters, we can substitute this value into the equation:

2(71) + b = 141

Simplifying the equation, we get:

142 + b = 141

Subtracting 142 from both sides gives us:

b = -20

Since b cannot be negative, we know that the shorter side is 20 meters.

Perimeter = a + b + a + b

where a and b are the lengths of the two sides.

We know that the perimeter is 204m, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

204 = a + b + a + b

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Subtracting 2a from both sides gives us:

Subtracting 2b from both sides gives us:

202 - 2a = 0

Solving for a, we get:

a = 101

Now that we know the length of one side, we can find the length of the other side by using the fact that the perimeter is equal to the sum of the lengths of all the sides. We can substitute the value of a into the equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the length of the fourth side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 236 cm, so we can write an equation based on the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral:

P = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides.

We also know that two of the sides are 69 cm and 50 cm, so we can substitute those values into the equation:

P = a + b + c + d
= 69 + 50 + x + x
= 129 + 2x

We also know that the third side is 39 cm, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

P = a + b + c + d
= 129 + 2x
= 129 + 2(39)

So, we have:

207 = 129 + 2x

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the length of the side that is unknown &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 193cm, so we can write an equation based on that:

Perimeter = 2(37 + 14 + x)

We also know that one of the sides measures 37cm, so we can write another equation based on that:

37 + 14 + x = 73

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for &quot;x&quot; by subtracting the two equations and solving for &quot;x&quot;:

2(37 + 14 + x) = 73

Subtracting the two equations, we get:

2(37 + 14 + x) - (37 + 14 + x) = 73 - 37 - 14 - x

Simplifying, we get:

2x = 193 - 73 - 14 - x

Subtracting &quot;x&quot; from both sides, we get:

x = 193 - 73 - 14 - x

Solving for &quot;x&quot;, we get:

x = 193 - 73 - 14 - x

x = 193 - 87 - 14

x = 193 - 101

x = 92

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

We know that the perimeter of the rectangle is 228 meters, so we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 228

Simplifying the equation:

l + w = 114

Subtracting l from both sides:

w = 114 - l

We know that the length of the rectangle is 90 meters, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

w = 114 - 90

w = 24

Therefore, the width of the rectangle is 24 meters.

We are given that the perimeter is 136 meters, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

136 = 4s

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for s:

s = 136/4

            A rectangle has a total perimeter of 236 meters. If one side of the rectangle is 43 meters, can you determine the length of the opposite side?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Perimeter = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides of the rectangle.

We know that the perimeter is 236 meters, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

236 = a + b + c + d

We also know that one side of the rectangle is 43 meters, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

236 = a + 43 + c + d

Now we have two equations and four variables. We can solve for the length of the opposite side by using substitution or elimination.

Let's use substitution. We can substitute the value of one side (43) into the second equation and solve for the length of the opposite side:

236 = a + 43 + c + d
236 = a + 43 + c + (236 - a - 43)

Now we have:

236 = a + 43 + c + (236 - a - 43)
236 = a + 43 + c + 193

Now we can solve for c:

c = 236 - a - 43

Now we have:

236 = a + 43 + (236 - a - 43)
236 = a + 43 + 193

Now we can solve for a:

a = 236 - 43 - 193
a = 150

Now we have:

236 = 150 + 43 + 193
236 = 286

This is a contradiction, so there is no solution to the problem.

            A quadrilateral has a perimeter of 206m. Two of its sides together have a length of 58m, and the other two sides together have a length of 54m and 1m, respectively. What is the length of the missing portion of the perimeter?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the length of the side that is 58m &quot;a&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 206m, so we can write an equation based on the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral:

perimeter = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral.

We also know that two of the sides together have a length of 58m, so we can write:

a + b = 58

We also know that the other two sides together have a length of 54m and 1m, so we can write:

c + d = 54 + 1 = 55

Now we have two equations and four variables. We can solve for the missing portion of the perimeter by substituting the values of a, b, c, and d into the first equation and then solving for the missing portion.

a + b = 58
c + d = 55

a = 30
b = 28
c = 1
d = 54

Now we can substitute these values into the first equation:

30 + 28 = 58

58 - 28 = 30

20 = 30

Therefore, the missing portion of the perimeter is 20m.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Given that the perimeter is 150 feet, we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 150

Simplifying the equation:

2l + 2w = 150

Subtracting 2w from both sides:

2l = 150 - 2w

Dividing both sides by 2:

l = 75 - w

Since the length of the rectangle is 69 feet, we can substitute this value into the equation:

l = 69

Substituting l = 69 into the equation:

2(69) + 2w = 150

Expanding the equation:

138 + 2w = 150

Subtracting 138 from both sides:

2w = 11

Dividing both sides by 2:

w = 5.5

Therefore, the width of the rectangle is 5.5 feet.

Let's call the length of the fourth side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 199m, so we can write an equation based on the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral:

Perimeter = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides.

We also know that the length of one side is 9m, the length of the second side is 30m, and the length of the third side is 71m.

So, we can substitute these values into the equation:

Perimeter = a + b + c + d
= 9 + 30 + 71 + x
= 199

Now we have an equation with one variable (x) and one constant (199). We can solve for x by subtracting 9 + 30 + 71 from both sides:

x = 199 - (9 + 30 + 71)
= 199 - 110
= 89

So, the length of the fourth side is 89m.

Let the length of the fourth side be x.

Since the perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides, we can write:

Perimeter = 35 + 62 + 70 + x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

207 = 35 + 62 + 70 + x

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides.

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangular field can be found by adding the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the perimeter is 174m.

Let's call the length of the field &quot;l&quot; and the width &quot;w&quot;. We can write an equation based on the perimeter formula:

Perimeter = 2(l + w)

We know that the perimeter is 174m, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

2(l + w) = 174

Now we can solve for &quot;l&quot; and &quot;w&quot;:

l + w = 174 / 2

l = 174 / 2 - w

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for &quot;l&quot; and &quot;w&quot; by substituting the equation for &quot;l&quot; into the second equation:

l = 174 / 2 - w

w = 174 / 2 - l

Now we can solve for &quot;l&quot; and &quot;w&quot; by substituting the values we know into the equations:

l = 174 / 2 - w

l = 174 / 2 - (174 / 2 - l)

l = l

w = 174 / 2 - l

w = 174 / 2 - (174 / 2 - w)

w = w

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 176 cm, so we can write an equation based on the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral:

Perimeter = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides.

We also know that the lengths of the three sides are 25 cm, 17 cm, and 89 cm, so we can substitute those values into the equation:

Perimeter = 25 + 17 + 89 + x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

176 = 25 + 17 + 89 + x

Subtracting 25 + 17 + 89 from both sides, we get:

x = 176 - (25 + 17 + 89)

x = 176 - 121

x = 55

Let's call the lengths of the sides a, b, c, and d, where a, b, and c are the given lengths, and d is the length of the fourth side.

Using the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral, we can write:

97 + 5 + 30 + x = 157

Simplifying the equation:

152 + x = 157

Subtracting 152 from both sides:

x = 5

Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 5m.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the length of the fourth side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 173m, so we can write an equation based on the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral:

Perimeter = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides.

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

173 = 46 + 50 + 35 + x

Simplifying, we get:

173 = 131 + x

Subtracting 131 from both sides, we get:

x = 42

So the length of the fourth side is 42m.

Perimeter = 2 x (length + width)

We know that the length of the rectangle is 23m, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

Perimeter = 2 x (23 + width)

We also know that the total perimeter of the rectangle is 116m, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Perimeter = a + b + a + b

where a and b are the lengths of the two sides.

We know that the perimeter is 254m, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

254 = a + b + a + b

Simplifying the equation, we get:

254 = 2a + 2b

Subtracting 2a from both sides gives us:

254 - 2a = 2b

Subtracting 2b from both sides gives us:

254 - 2a - 2b = 0

Solving for b, we get:

b = (254 - 2a) / 2

Substituting the value of a, which is 89m, into the equation, we get:

b = (254 - 2(89)) / 2

b = 165 / 2

b = 82.5m

Therefore, the length of the other side of the rectangle is 82.5m.

The perimeter of the quadrilateral is then:

Simplifying the equation:

35 + x + 81 = 191

x + 81 = 156

We know that one pair of opposite sides is 47 feet, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

Perimeter = 2(x + y) = 2(47 + y)

Now we can solve for &quot;y&quot;:

y = Perimeter - 2(47)
y = 128 - 94
y = 34

So the length of the remaining two opposite sides is 34 feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The formula for the perimeter of a square is P = 4s, where s is the length of one side.

Given that the perimeter is 356m, we can set up the equation:

4s = 356

Solving for s, we get:

s = 356/4

s = 89

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the length of the third side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 236 units.

We also know that the sum of the lengths of the three sides is 89 + 87 + x = 175 + x.

We can set up an equation using these two pieces of information:

175 + x = 236

x = 59

We know that the total perimeter of the quadrilateral is 81m, so we can write an equation based on that:

Perimeter = 1 + 54 + 9 + x

We also know that the sum of the lengths of all four sides is equal to the perimeter, so we can write another equation based on that:

1 + 54 + 9 + x = 81

Now we have two equations and two variables (x and the length of the fourth side). We can solve the system of equations to find the value of x.

Solving the system of equations, we get:

x = 24

So the length of the fourth side is 24m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the length of the fourth side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 246m, so we can write an equation based on the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral:

P = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides.

We also know that two of the sides are 40m and 32m long, so we can substitute those values into the equation:

P = a + b + c + d
= 40 + 32 + x + x
= 72 + 2x

We also know that one of the sides is 95m long, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

P = a + b + c + d
= 40 + 32 + x + x
= 72 + 2x
= 95 + 2x

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x by subtracting the two equations:

72 + 2x = 95 + 2x

Subtracting the two equations gives us:

54 = 95

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Perimeter = a + a + a + a

where a is the length of one side of the square.

Substituting the given value of the perimeter, we get:

32 = 4a

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

a = 8

Therefore, the length of one side of the square is 8 meters.

            A square has a perimeter of 12 meters. Can you find the length of one side of the square?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can find the length of one side of the square.

Let's call the length of one side &quot;x&quot;. Then, the perimeter of the square is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 4x

We are given that the perimeter is 12 meters, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 12

To solve for &quot;x&quot;, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 12/4

x = 3

Therefore, the length of one side of the square is 3 meters.</pre>

            A quadrilateral has a perimeter of 160m. If the three known sides have lengths of 29m, 16m, and 41m, what is the length of the fourth side?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the length of the fourth side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 160m, so we can write an equation based on the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral:

Perimeter = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the sides.

We also know that the three known sides have lengths of 29m, 16m, and 41m, so we can substitute those values into the equation:

Perimeter = 29 + 16 + 41 + x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

160 = 29 + 16 + 41 + x

Subtracting 29 + 16 + 41 from both sides, we get:

x = 160 - 76

x = 84

Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 84m.

            A rectangle has two sides measuring 45m each. If the total perimeter of the rectangle is 210m, what is the length of each of the other two sides?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 210m.

Let's call the length of one side 45m. The other side must be 45m as well, since the rectangle is a square.

The perimeter of the rectangle is then:

45m + 45m + 45m + 45m = 210m

So, the length of each of the other two sides is also 45m.
