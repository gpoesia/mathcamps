            At a party, 66 teenagers and 6 adults attend at first. Later on, the number of guests increases by 62. Near the end, an additional group of 52 people join the party. How many people attended the party in total?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's start by identifying the total number of guests at the party at first:
66 teenagers + 6 adults = 72 guests

Later on, the number of guests increases by 62:
72 guests + 62 = 134 guests

Near the end, an additional group of 52 people join the party:
134 guests + 52 = 186 guests

Therefore, the total number of people who attended the party is 186.

Let's start by identifying the total number of guests at the pre-party:

The hosts want to estimate the total attendance for both the party and its pre-party. We can add the number of guests at the pre-party to the number of guests at the party:
72 guests + 186 guests = 258 guests

Therefore, the total number of people who attended both events in total is 258.

Total number of adults = 74 + 58 = &lt;&lt;74+58=132&gt;&gt;132
Total number of people = 132 + 58 = &lt;&lt;132+58=190&gt;&gt;190

Now, let's add the additional 20 adults to the total number of people.

Total number of people = 190 + 20 = &lt;&lt;190+20=210&gt;&gt;210

Therefore, there were 210 people at the party, including the additional 20 adults.</pre>

            A fisherman was in his boat out on the lake. The total length, in inches, of all the fish he caught today was 90 inches. On the way back to shore, he caught 14 more inches of fish. He also caught a total of 56 inches of fish yesterday. Before he went home he caught an additional 46 inches of fish from the dock. If he added all the inches of fish he caught together, how many total inches of fish did he catch?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the total length of fish caught today &quot;x&quot; inches.

We know that the total length of fish caught today is 90 inches.

We also know that the fisherman caught 14 more inches of fish on the way back to shore.

So, the total length of fish caught today is:

x = 90 + 14 = 104 inches

We also know that the fisherman caught a total of 56 inches of fish yesterday.

So, the total length of fish caught yesterday is:

y = 56 inches

We also know that the fisherman caught an additional 46 inches of fish from the dock.

So, the total length of fish caught from the dock is:

z = 46 inches

We need to add all the inches of fish caught together to find the total length of fish caught.

The total length of fish caught is:

x + y + z = 104 + 56 + 46 = 206 inches

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the number of rings in the first display case &quot;x&quot;. Then, the number of rings in the second display case is equal to 59 + x.

We know that the total number of rings in both display cases is 98, so we can set up the equation:

x + (59 + x) = 98

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 59 = 98

Subtracting 59 from both sides:

2x = 39

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 19

So, there are 19 rings in the first display case and 59 + 19 = 78 rings in the second display case.</pre>

            In the previous scenario, John initially bought 59 jackets. However, let's reconsider that scenario with a slight modification. 

This time, after buying the initial 59 jackets, John went to another store and bought 83 more jackets. Then, as he was leaving, he noticed a stand with discount jackets and purchased 58 more of them there. 

How many jackets did John buy in total under these new conditions?

            A penguin named Zazu finds 66 shiny stones. Zazu sees that his friend Umi has found 70 more shiny stones than him. Another friend named Yara tucked away 36 shiny stones in addition to what Umi found. How many shiny stones did Yara find in total?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's first find out how many shiny stones Umi found. We know that Umi found 70 more shiny stones than Zazu, so we can set up the equation:

Umi's shiny stones = Zazu's shiny stones + 70

We know that Zazu found 66 shiny stones, so we can substitute that into the equation:

Umi's shiny stones = 66 + 70

Solving for Umi's shiny stones, we get:

Umi's shiny stones = 136

Now, we know that Yara found 36 shiny stones in addition to what Umi found. So, we can add that to Umi's total:

Yara's shiny stones = Umi's shiny stones + 36

Yara's shiny stones = 136 + 36

Yara's shiny stones = 172

Therefore, Yara found 172 shiny stones in total.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

We know that Yara found 172 shiny stones and Dina found 34 more shiny stones. So, the total number of shiny stones now is:

Total number of shiny stones = Yara's shiny stones + Dina's shiny stones

Total number of shiny stones = 172 + 34

Total number of shiny stones = 206

Therefore, there are 206 shiny stones in total now, including Yara's and Dina's finds.

Mike added 13 gallons to one tank in the morning, and then added another 55 gallons to the same tank in the afternoon, for a total of 13 + 55 = 68 gallons.

In the other tank, Mike added 57 gallons in the morning and 33 gallons in the afternoon, for a total of 57 + 33 = 90 gallons.

Therefore, the total quantity of water (in gallons) that Mike added to both of his tanks throughout the day is 68 + 90 = 158 gallons.

We have already calculated the total amount of water added to the two tanks, which is 158 gallons.

To find the total amount of water added throughout the day, we need to add the amount of water added to the pond, which is 56 gallons.

Therefore, the total amount of water added throughout the day is 158 + 56 = 214 gallons.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's call the total number of trees in the forest &quot;T&quot;. We know that there are 84 oak trees, so we can write:

T = 84 + x

where x is the number of pine trees. We also know that the number of pine trees adds 75 more to the total number of trees, so we can write:

T = 84 + x + 75

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

T = 169

So there are 169 trees in the forest.

Let's call the chest measurement &quot;C&quot;.

We know that the length of the shirt is 86 cm.

We also know that the chest measurement is the length added by 11 cm.

So, C = 86 + 11 = 97 cm.

The waist measurement is the same as the sum of the two chest measurements.

So, W = C + C = 97 + 97 = 194 cm.

Later in the day, Kevin, her friend, comes over and makes an additional quantity of sandwiches such that in total, the sandwiches he makes added to Sarah's make up 33 more than the number of sandwiches made by Sarah.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that Sarah made 80 sandwiches. We can set up an equation to represent this:

Sarah's sandwiches = 80

We know that Kevin's sandwiches added to Sarah's make up 33 more than the number of sandwiches made by Sarah. We can represent this as:

Kevin's sandwiches + Sarah's sandwiches = 80 + 33

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

Kevin's sandwiches = 80 + 33 - Sarah's sandwiches

Now we can substitute the value of Sarah's sandwiches:

Kevin's sandwiches = 80 + 33 - 80

Kevin's sandwiches = 33

Therefore, Kevin made 33 sandwiches.</pre>

1. The truck driver starts with 83 gallons of gas in his tank.
2. He stops at the first station and fills up an additional 36 gallons, so he now has 83 + 36 = 129 gallons of gas in his tank.
3. He drives until he needs to refill and adds 99 more gallons, so he now has 129 + 99 = 228 gallons of gas in his tank.
4. He stops near his destination and tops off his tank with 7 gallons, so he now has 228 + 7 = 235 gallons of gas in his tank.

Consider now that we made a mistake and that the left lens can actually magnify objects from a distance of 54 miles away instead of 30 miles. Keeping the right lense and the telescope the same at 56 and 67 miles respectively, what would be the new total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The left binocular lens can now magnify objects from a distance of 54 miles away, and the right lens can still magnify objects that are 56 miles away. Therefore, the total distance from which both lenses can magnify objects is the sum of the distances: 54 + 56 = 108 miles.

The telescope can still magnify objects from a distance of 67 miles away.

Therefore, the new total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects is the sum of the distances: 108 + 67 = 175 miles.

### Answer: 175 miles</pre>

            In the land of the Wizarding World, one wand spells costs 50 magical crystals known as Quiblets. Quintus the wizard adds 5 Quiblets more to this to cast a slightly stronger spell. This amount is then topped up by 25 magical Quiblets to cast the most powerful spell. How many Quiblets does Quintus the wizard need to cast the most powerful spell?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Quintus the wizard needs 50 Quiblets to cast the first spell, and then he adds 5 Quiblets more to make it slightly stronger. So, he needs 50 + 5 = &lt;&lt;50+5=55&gt;&gt;55 Quiblets to cast the slightly stronger spell. Then, he adds 25 Quiblets to make it the most powerful spell. So, he needs 55 + 25 = &lt;&lt;55+25=80&gt;&gt;80 Quiblets to cast the most powerful spell.

            As an extension to the previous problem, let's say Quintus the wizard then decides to cast an ancient and profound spell. To cast this spell, he needs to gather an additional number of Quiblets equivalent to his most powerful spell, plus 50 more. How many Quiblets does Quintus the wizard need in total to cast this ancient spell?

            As a variation to the previous problem, let's say the most powerful spell that Quintus the wizard wants to cast actually requires an additional 87 Quiblets on top of the slightly stronger spell, not just 25. How many Quiblets does he now need to cast this more demanding powerful spell?
