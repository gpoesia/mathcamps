The highest slide has 4165 steps, and the third highest slide has 3908 steps. To find the difference, we subtract the number of steps on the third highest slide from the number of steps on the highest slide:

4165 - 3908 = 167

We know that the clock showed 4407 seconds when Roberta looked at it.

We also know that the clock started counting from 0, so the current clock reading is 5259 seconds.

Subtracting the current clock reading from the previous reading gives us:

5259 - 4407 = 852 seconds

We know that Roberta spent 4087 additional seconds completing a task.

Subtracting the current clock reading from the previous reading gives us:

Therefore, y = 852 seconds.

Adding the time Roberta spent on the task to the time that had passed since she checked gives us:

So, after making the necklaces, the jewelry shop would have 5926 beads left over.

This year, the number of criminal cases has surged to 6401.

Therefore, the total number of criminal cases recorded in the last two years is:
2506 + 6401 = &lt;&lt;2506+6401=8907&gt;&gt;8907.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To find the number of cases that are still unresolved, we need to subtract the number of resolved cases from the total number of cases.

Total number of cases = 2506 + 6401 = &lt;&lt;2506+6401=8907&gt;&gt;8907
Number of resolved cases = 5359

Therefore, the number of cases that are still unresolved is:
Total number of cases - Number of resolved cases = 8907 - 5359 = &lt;&lt;8907-5359=3548&gt;&gt;3548.

The total number of dolls produced in May is 9341 - 1153 = &lt;&lt;9341-1153=8188&gt;&gt;8188.
The number of dolls produced in the first week of June is 432.
The total number of dolls produced after the additional production is 8188 + 432 = &lt;&lt;8188+432=8619&gt;&gt;8619.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the total number of starfish found in the region before the two-month period &quot;x&quot;.

We know that 283 new starfish were spotted in the same region after two months, so the total number of starfish found in the region after two months is:

x + 283

We also know that the total number of starfish found in the region before the two-month period was 6778.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + 283 = 6778

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6778 - 283

x = 6505

Therefore, there were 6505 starfish in total found in the region after two months.

We know that 274 visitors arrived before lunch, so x = 274.

We also know that 5031 visitors arrived after lunch, so x + 5031 = 5305.

Solving for x, we get:

x + 5031 = 5305
x = 5305 - 5031
x = 304
