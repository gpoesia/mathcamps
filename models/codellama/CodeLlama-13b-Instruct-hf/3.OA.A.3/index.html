        In a magical fairy world, there are 4 fairies per house and 3 houses in a cluster. Each fairy creates 5 magic dust particles a day. How many magic dust particles are created in one day by all the fairies in a cluster?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

There are 4 fairies per house, and 3 houses in a cluster. Therefore, there are 4 x 3 = 12 fairies in the cluster.

Each fairy creates 5 magic dust particles a day, so the total number of magic dust particles created by all the fairies in the cluster is 12 x 5 = 60 magic dust particles per day.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

If each magic dust particle created lasts for 1 whole week, then the total number of magic dust particles available in a cluster of houses after a week is the same as the total number of magic dust particles created in a week.

We know that the total number of magic dust particles created in a week by all the fairies in a cluster is 60 magic dust particles.

Therefore, the total number of magic dust particles available in a cluster of houses after a week is also 60 magic dust particles.

        A pirate found a treasure map. The map indicated that the treasure chest was buried at a spot marked by 2 stones multiplied by 9. How many stones mark the hiding place of the treasure chest?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The map indicated that the treasure chest was buried at a spot marked by 2 stones multiplied by 9.

Let's call the number of stones that mark the hiding place of the treasure chest &quot;x&quot;.

According to the map, the treasure chest is buried at a spot marked by 2x.

Since the map indicates that the treasure chest is buried at a spot marked by 2 stones multiplied by 9, we can set up the equation:

2x = 9

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 9/2

x = 4.5

Therefore, there are 4.5 stones that mark the hiding place of the treasure chest.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Sally has 40 feathers, and she wants to arrange them in groups of 10. To find out how many groups she would have, we can divide the number of feathers by the number of feathers in each group:

40 / 10 = &lt;&lt;40/10=4&gt;&gt;4 groups

Therefore, Sally would have 4 groups of 10 feathers.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

1. John wants to divide his camping area of 44 square meters into 11 equal sections.
2. Each section would host a tent.
3. Each tent can accommodate 12 campers.

To find the total number of campers, we need to find the total number of tents that can be set up in the camping area.

1. To find the total number of tents, we can divide the total area of the camping area by the area of each tent.

Total area of the camping area = 44 square meters
Area of each tent = 1 square meter (since each tent can accommodate 12 campers)

Total number of tents = Total area of the camping area / Area of each tent
Total number of tents = 44 / 1
Total number of tents = 44

4. Since each tent can accommodate 12 campers, the total number of campers that can camp in total is 44 x 12 = 528 campers.

        Mommy has a tradition that for every month, she buys 5 new toys for her baby. If the baby is 10 months old, how many toys has Mommy bought in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's assume that the baby is 10 months old.

For every month, Mommy buys 5 new toys for her baby.

So, for the first 10 months, Mommy has bought 5 toys for her baby every month.

Therefore, the total number of toys that Mommy has bought for her baby in the first 10 months is:

5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 50

### Answer: 50</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        After reflecting on her toy buying habits, Mommy realizes that she bought too many toys in the beginning. Instead of buying 5 new toys every month for 10 months, she now remembers that there was a month when she didn't buy any toys. Therefore, she only bought 5 toys per month for 9 months. How many toys did she actually buy during that period?
