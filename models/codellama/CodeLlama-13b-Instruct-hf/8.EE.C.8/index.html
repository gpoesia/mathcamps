        Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables q and s.

First, we can solve the first equation for q:

q = (40 * s) - 37

Now, we can substitute this expression for q into the second equation:

(30 * s) + (12 * (40 * s) - 37) = 121

Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get:

(30 * s) + (12 * 40s - 37) = 121

(30 * s) + (480s - 37) = 121

(30 * s) + 443 = 121

443 = (30 * s)

s = 443 / 30

s = 14.73

Now that we have the value of s, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for q:

q = (40 * 14.73) - 37

q = 551.14 - 37

q = 514.14

Therefore, the values of q and s are q = 514.14 and s = 14.73.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables b and m.

First, we can solve the first equation for m:

m = (180 - 4 * b) / 44

Now, we can substitute this expression for m into the second equation:

79 * (180 - 4 * b) / 44 - 6 * b = 48

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

1260 - 288 * b + 272 * b - 216 * b^2 = 48

Combine like terms:

216 * b^2 - 504 * b + 1260 = 0

Now, we can factor the left-hand side:

(b - 12) * (18 * b - 40) = 0

This tells us that either b - 12 = 0 or 18 * b - 40 = 0.

Solving for b, we get:

b = 12 or b = 40/18

Now, we can substitute these values back into the original equations to find the values of m:

m = (180 - 4 * 12) / 44 = 12

m = (180 - 4 * 40/18) / 44 = 12

Therefore, the values of b and m are b = 12 and m = 12.</pre>

First, we can add the two equations to get:

42o - 15g = 28
47o + 29g = 141

Combine like terms:

42o - 15g = 28
47o + 29g = 141

Subtract the first equation from the second equation:

47o - 42o = 141 - 28

Combine like terms:

25o = 113

Divide both sides by 25:

o = 4.4

Now that we have found o, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find g:

42o - 15g = 28

Substitute o = 4.4:

42(4.4) - 15g = 28

Combine like terms:

176.8 - 15g = 28

Subtract 176.8 from both sides:

-15g = -152

Divide both sides by -15:

g = 9

Therefore, the values of o and g are:

        Given the following system of equations, determine the values of v and o:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables v and o.

First, let's solve the first equation for v:

(12 * v) - (6 * o) = 21

Adding 6 * o to both sides:

12 * v = 21 + 6 * o

Dividing both sides by 12:

v = (21 + 6 * o) / 12

Now, let's solve the second equation for o:

(76 * v) - (45 * o) = 50

Subtracting 45 * o from both sides:

76 * v = 50 + 45 * o

Dividing both sides by 76:

v = (50 + 45 * o) / 76

Now, we have two equations and two variables. We can substitute the expression for v from the first equation into the second equation:

(50 + 45 * o) / 76 = (21 + 6 * o) / 12

Multiplying both sides by 12:

50 + 45 * o = 21 + 6 * o

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

45 * o = 6 * o

Dividing both sides by 45:

o = 6

Now, we can substitute the value of o into the expression for v from the first equation:

v = (21 + 6 * o) / 12
v = (21 + 6 * 6) / 12
v = 21 + 36 / 12
v = 21 + 3
v = 24

Therefore, the values of v and o are 24 and 6, respectively.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables f and g.

First, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to get:

75f + 25g = 138 - 143

This simplifies to:

-7f - 25g = -65

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by -7 to get:

f + 9g = -8

Now we have two equations and two variables, so we can solve for f and g.

f = -8 - 9g

Substituting this expression for f into the first equation, we get:

-8 - 9g + 25g = 138

This simplifies to:

-17g = 120

Dividing both sides of the equation by -17 gives us:

g = 7

Now we can find f by substituting g into the expression for f:

f = -8 - 9(7)

f = -8 - 63

f = -75

Therefore, the values of f and g are f = -75 and g = 7.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables y and n.

First, we can solve the first equation for y:

194 = 4 * y + 14 * n

Subtracting 4 * y from both sides gives us:

190 = 14 * n

Dividing both sides by 14 gives us:

13.57 = n

Now, we can substitute this value of n into the second equation:

7 = 65 * n - 79 * y

Substituting n = 13.57 and simplifying gives us:

7 = 65 * 13.57 - 79 * y

7 = 851.7 - 1063 * y

Subtracting 851.7 from both sides gives us:

-1063 * y = -851.7

Dividing both sides by -1063 gives us:

y = 0.81

Now, we can substitute this value of y into the first equation:

194 = 4 * 0.81 + 14 * n

Substituting y = 0.81 and simplifying gives us:

194 = 3.24 + 14 * n

Subtracting 3.24 from both sides gives us:

190.76 = 14 * n

Dividing both sides by 14 gives us:

13.76 = n

Therefore, the values of y and n are y = 0.81 and n = 13.76.</pre>

First, we can solve the first equation for l:

Dividing both sides by 26 gives:

l = 4.6

Now, we can substitute this value of l into the second equation:

6 = 41 * l - 53 * g

Substituting l = 4.6 gives:

6 = 41 * 4.6 - 53 * g

Simplifying gives:

Subtracting 174 from both sides gives:

-168 = -53 * g

Substitution Method:

Let's substitute the second equation into the first equation:

1) 20 * p + 56 * y = 90
2) 89 * p + 7 * y = 98

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

1) 20 * p + 56 * y = 90
2) 89 * p + 7 * y = 98

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

1) 20 * p + 56 * y = 90
2) 89 * p + 7 * y = 98

Solving for p and y, we get:

p = 3
y = 12

Therefore, the values of p and y are 3 and 12, respectively.

Elimination Method:

Let's eliminate the variable y from the two equations:

1) 20 * p + 56 * y = 90
2) 89 * p + 7 * y = 98

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

k = 17/72 + 22*d/72

Now, we can substitute this expression for k into the second equation:

6*d + 69*k = 96

6*d + 69*(17/72 + 22*d/72) = 96

6*d + 69*(17/72) + 69*22*d/72 = 96

6*d + 1176/72 + 1416*d/72 = 96

53 = (89 * r) - (111 * a) - (6 * r)

53 = (89 * r) - (111 * a) - (6 * r)

53 = (89 * r) - (111 * a) - (6 * r)

Now, we can solve for r and a by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

r = 53 / (89 - 111)

a = 53 / (37 + 6)

Now, we can substitute these values into the original equations to verify that they are correct:

53 = ((89 * r) - (74 * a))

53 = ((89 * (53 / (89 - 111))) - (74 * (53 / (37 + 6))))

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

Now, we can simplify the expressions by multiplying both sides of the equation by (89 - 111) and (37 + 6):

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

Now, we can simplify the expressions by multiplying both sides of the equation by (89 - 111) and (37 + 6):

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

Now, we can simplify the expressions by multiplying both sides of the equation by (89 - 111) and (37 + 6):

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

Now, we can simplify the expressions by multiplying both sides of the equation by (89 - 111) and (37 + 6):

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

53 = (53 / (89 - 111)) - (53 / (37 + 6))

Now, we can simplify the expressions by multiplying both sides of the equation by (89 - 111) and (37 + 6):

53 = (53 / (89 - 111))</pre>

        Given the following pair of equations where 'g' and 'q' represent the quantities of two different types of grains in a mix, solve for 'g' and 'q':

1. The sum of the weights of 42 units of 'g' and 12 units of 'q' equals 169 kg.
2. The weight of 12 units of 'q' minus the weight of 50 units of 'g' results in 19 kg.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the first equation to solve for 'g'. We know that the sum of the weights of 42 units of 'g' and 12 units of 'q' equals 169 kg, so we can write:

42g + 12q = 169 kg

Now, we can use the second equation to solve for 'q'. We know that the weight of 12 units of 'q' minus the weight of 50 units of 'g' results in 19 kg, so we can write:

12q - 50g = 19 kg

Now, we can solve for 'q' by adding the two equations:

42g + 12q = 169 kg
12q - 50g = 19 kg

We can simplify the first equation by subtracting the second equation from the first:

42g + 12q - 12q + 50g = 169 kg - 19 kg

This simplifies to:

30g = 150 kg

Now, we can divide both sides by 30 to solve for 'g':

g = 5

Now that we have solved for 'g', we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for 'q':

42g + 12q = 169 kg
42(5) + 12q = 169 kg
210 + 12q = 169 kg
12q = 148 kg

q = 12

Therefore, the quantities of the two types of grains in the mix are 5 units of 'g' and 12 units of 'q'.</pre>

        Find the values of s and v for the following system of equations:

37 * s - 11 * v = 54

82 * s - 62 * v = 41
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables s and v.

First, we can add the two equations together to get:

37s - 11v = 54
82s - 62v = 41

Combine like terms:

29s - 73v = 95

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 29 to get:

s - 73/29v = 95/29

Now, we can solve for s:

s = 95/29 + 73/29v

Now, we can substitute this expression for s into the second equation:

82(95/29 + 73/29v) - 62v = 41

Expand and simplify:

765/29 - 62v = 41

Now, we can solve for v:

v = 41 - 765/29

v = -19

Now, we can substitute this expression for v into the first equation:

s = 95/29 + 73/29(-19)

s = 95/29 + 73/29(19)

s = 95/29 + 14

s = 109/29

So, the values of s and v are:

s = 109/29
v = -19

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve for c and z, we need to use the concept of linear equations. We can set up a system of two linear equations with two variables, c and z.

First, we can solve for z in the first equation:

41c + 65z = 151

Subtracting 41c from both sides gives us:

65z = 151 - 41c

Dividing both sides by 65 gives us:

z = (151 - 41c) / 65

Now, we can substitute this expression for z into the second equation:

78z - 48c = 48

Substituting the expression for z from the first equation, we get:

78((151 - 41c) / 65) - 48c = 48

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

1128 - 48c = 48

Adding 48c to both sides gives us:

1176 = 48c

Dividing both sides by 48 gives us:

c = 26

Now that we have found c, we can substitute it into the expression for z from the first equation:

z = (151 - 41c) / 65

Dividing both sides by 60 gives:

c = (7 + 91 * i) / 60

Now, we can substitute this expression for c into the second equation:

7 * i + 76 * (7 + 91 * i) / 60 = 148

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution. We can start by solving the first equation for e, and then substitute that expression into the second equation.

First, we can solve the first equation for e:

71*v - 37*e = 69

Adding 37*e to both sides gives:

71*v = 69 + 37*e

Dividing both sides by 71 gives:

v = (69 + 37*e) / 71

Now, we can substitute this expression for v into the second equation:

41*e + 76*((69 + 37*e) / 71) = 184

Expanding and simplifying gives:

41*e + 76*(69 + 37*e) / 71 = 184

Combine like terms:

41*e + 76*69 / 71 + 76*37*e / 71 = 184

Simplify:

41*e + 4929 / 71 + 76*37*e / 71 = 184

Combine like terms:

41*e + 4929 / 71 + 3013*e / 71 = 184

Subtract 3013*e / 71 from both sides:

41*e = 184 - 4929 / 71 - 3013*e / 71

Divide both sides by 41:

e = (184 - 4929 / 71 - 3013*e / 71) / 41

Now, we can solve for e by substituting the expression for e into the first equation:

71*v - 37*(184 - 4929 / 71 - 3013*e / 71) / 41 = 69

Expand and simplify:

71*v - 37*(184 - 4929 / 71 - 3013*e / 71) / 41 = 69

Combine like terms:

Simplify:

Subtract 3013*e / 71 from both sides:

41*e = 184 - 4929 / 71 - 3013*e / 71

Divide both sides by 41:

e = (184 - 4929 / 71 - 3013*e / 71) / 41

25x + 69y = 113

We can solve for x by subtracting 69y from both sides:

25x = 113 - 69y

Now, let's solve the second equation:

26y + 42x = 85

We can solve for y by subtracting 26y from both sides:

42x = 85 - 26y

Now, we have two equations and two variables. We can use substitution to solve for x and y.

First, let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:

26y + 42(113 - 69y) = 85

Now, we can simplify the equation:

26y + 42(113) - 42(69y) = 85

Now, we can solve for y:

26y + 4926 - 3163y = 85

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 85 / (26 + 42)

Now, we can substitute y into the first equation:

x = 113 - 69y

Now, we can substitute y into the second equation:

x = 85 - 26y

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 85 - 26(85 / (26 + 42))

Now, we can simplify the equation:

x = 85 - 26(85 / 68)

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 85 - 26(1.2857)

Now, we can simplify the equation:

x = 85 - 32.23

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 52.77

Now, we can substitute x into the first equation:

v = 113 - 69(52.77)

Now, we can simplify the equation:

v = 113 - 411.31

Now, we can solve for v:

v = -308.31

Now, we can substitute v into the second equation:

d = 85 - 26(-308.31)

Now, we can simplify the equation:

d = 85 + 816.31

Now, we can solve for d:

d = 891.31

115z - 164g = 101

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 115 to get:

Now, we can solve for g by dividing both sides of the equation by z:

g = 0.85 / z

87u = 7 + 75d

Dividing both sides by 87 gives us:

Now, let's solve the second equation for u:

Subtracting 82u from both sides gives us:

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (u and d). We can substitute the expression for u in terms of d from the first equation into the second equation to solve for d in terms of u:

u = (7 + 370u + 190u^2) / 87

Now, we can solve for u by finding the roots of this quadratic equation. The roots are:

u = -11/19 and u = 1/19

Now, we can substitute these values of u into the expression for d to find the corresponding values of d:

d = (54 + 82(-11/19)) / 85 = -11/19
d = (54 + 82(1/19)) / 85 = 1/19

Therefore, the values of u and d that satisfy both equations are:

u = -11/19 and d = -11/19
u = 1/19 and d = 1/19

### Answer:
The values of u and d that satisfy both equations are:

u = -11/19 and d = -11/19
u = 1/19 and d = 1/19</pre>

        Bill is trying to decipher a secret code. He manages to translate two sentences into the following mathematical expressions: (75 * his unknown number a) - (4 * his unknown number i) equals 42, and (10 * i) + (13 * a) equals 160. Using these equations, can you figure out the values of i and a for him?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can help Bill decipher the secret code. Let's start by solving the first equation:

(75 * a) - (4 * i) = 42

We can simplify this equation by combining the like terms:

75a - 4i = 42

Now, let's solve for a:

75a = 42 + 4i

a = 42 / 75 + i / 4

Now, let's substitute this value of a into the second equation:

(10 * i) + (13 * (42 / 75 + i / 4)) = 160

Expanding the right-hand side of the equation:

(10 * i) + (13 * 42 / 75) + (13 * i / 4) = 160

Combine like terms:

10i + 13(42 / 75) + 13(i / 4) = 160

Simplify:

10i + 13(42 / 75) + 13(i / 4) = 160

Now, we can solve for i:

10i = 160 - 13(42 / 75) - 13(i / 4)

Expand and simplify:

10i = 160 - 13(42 / 75) - 13(i / 4)

i = 160 / 10 - 13(42 / 75) - 13(i / 4)

i = 16 - 13(42 / 75) - 13(i / 4)

Now, we can solve for a:

a = 42 / 75 + i / 4

Substitute the value of i:

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 13(i / 4)) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 13(16 / 4)) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 13(4)) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 12) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 12) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 12) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 12) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 12) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 12) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 12) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 12) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 12) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 12) / 4

a = 42 / 75 + (16 - 13(42 / 75) - 12) / 4

        Solve the following system of equations for the values of p and c:

37 * p + 74 * c = 183

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables p and c.

First, we can solve the first equation for c:

37 * p + 74 * c = 183

Subtracting 37 * p from both sides gives us:

74 * c = 183 - 37 * p

Dividing both sides by 74 gives us:

c = (183 - 37 * p) / 74

Now, we can substitute this expression for c into the second equation:

27 * (183 - 37 * p) / 74 - 18 * p = 13

Expanding and simplifying gives us:

27 * (183 - 37 * p) - 18 * p = 13

Factoring out the 18 gives us:

18 * (27 * (183 - 37 * p) - 13) = 0

Dividing both sides by 18 gives us:

27 * (183 - 37 * p) - 13 = 0

Now, we can solve for p:

27 * (183 - 37 * p) = 13

Subtracting 183 from both sides gives us:

27 * (-37 * p) = 13

Dividing both sides by 27 gives us:

-37 * p = 13 / 27

Dividing both sides by -37 gives us:

p = 13 / 27 / -37

p = -13 / 27

Now, we can substitute this expression for p into the first equation:

37 * (-13 / 27) + 74 * c = 183

Expanding and simplifying gives us:

37 * (-13 / 27) + 74 * c = 183

Substituting -13 / 27 for p and simplifying gives us:

74 * c = 183

Dividing both sides by 74 gives us:

c = 183 / 74

c = 2.41

Therefore, the values of p and c are:

p = -13 / 27
c = 2.41</pre>

First, we can add the two equations to get:

This simplifies to:

(48 * k) + (16 * p) = 142

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 48 to get:

k + (p/48) = 3

Now we have isolated k and p.

k = 3 - (p/48)

p = 48(3 - (p/48))

Substituting the value of k into the second equation, we get:

p = 48(3 - (p/48))

Simplifying, we get:

p = 48(3) - 48(p/48)

p = 144 - 48p

p = 96

So, p = 96.

Substituting the value of p into the first equation, we get:

k = 3 - (96/48)

k = 3 - 2

k = 1

So, k = 1.

Therefore, the values of k and p are k = 1 and p = 96.</pre>

This simplifies to:

120v = 179

Now, we can divide both sides by 120 to get:

v = 179/120

v = 1.5

Now that we have found the value of v, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of f.

For example, we can substitute v = 1.5 into the first equation:

75v - 69f = 14

75(1.5) - 69f = 14

112.5 - 69f = 14

This simplifies to:

43f = 14

11d - 60k = 12

Now, we can solve for d by dividing both sides by 11:

d = 60k / 11

Now, we can substitute this expression for d into the first equation:

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

480k - 60k = 38

Combined, we get:

Now, we can divide both sides by 420 to solve for k:

k = 38 / 420

Now, we can substitute this expression for k into the expression for d that we found earlier:

        Solve the following system of equations for h and p:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables h and p.

First, we can add the two equations to get:

(23 * h) - (46 * p) = 58
(11 * p) + (23 * h) = 124

Combine like terms:

23 * h - 46 * p = 58
11 * p + 23 * h = 124

Subtract the second equation from the first equation:

23 * h - 46 * p = 58
11 * p + 23 * h = 124

Subtract 23 * h from both sides of the first equation:

23 * h - 46 * p = 58
11 * p = 66

Now, we can solve for h:

23 * h = 66 + 46 * p
23 * h = 112 + 46 * p

Now, we can divide both sides by 23:

h = (112 + 46 * p) / 23

Now, we can substitute this expression for h into the second equation:

11 * p + (112 + 46 * p) / 23 = 124

Now, we can simplify the expression:

11 * p + (112 + 46 * p) / 23 = 124
11 * p + 112 / 23 + 46 * p = 124

Now, we can simplify the expression further:

11 * p + 4 + 46 * p = 124

Now, we can solve for p:

11 * p + 4 = 120
11 * p = 116

Now, we can divide both sides by 11:

p = 116 / 11
p = 10

Now, we can substitute the value of p back into the expression for h:

h = (112 + 46 * p) / 23
h = (112 + 460) / 23
h = 158 / 23
h = 7

Therefore, the values of h and p are h = 7 and p = 10.</pre>

        If the following system of equations represents the relationship between integers d and f, determine their values:
1) 19d + 6f = 120, 
2) 90d - 42f = 69.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to use the concept of linear Diophantine equations.

First, we can rewrite the first equation as:

19d + 6f = 120

This equation can be written in the form:

ax + by = c

where a = 19, b = 6, c = 120, and x = d and y = f.

Next, we can rewrite the second equation as:

90d - 42f = 69

This equation can be written in the form:

dx + ey = f

where d = 90, e = -42, f = 69, and x = d and y = f.

Now, we can solve the system of equations by using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

First, we find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and e, which is 3.

Next, we divide both a and e by the gcd to get:

a' = 6, e' = -14

Now, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the Bezout coefficients:

6a' + (-14)e' = 1

This equation has the solution:

a' = 1, e' = -2

Now, we can use the Bezout coefficients to find the solution to the original system of equations:

d = 19a' + 6e' = 19(1) + 6(-2) = 19 - 12 = 7
f = 90d - 42f = 90(7) - 42(1) = 630 - 42 = 588

Therefore, the values of d and f are 7 and 588, respectively.</pre>

        Here's a problem: 

A system of linear equations is given by the following formulas: 

1) 42 * m + 55 * r = 127 
2) 66 * m - 52 * r = 44 

Can you solve this system to find the values of 'r' and 'm'?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can solve this system of linear equations. To do so, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add the two equations to eliminate the variable 'r'.
2. Solve for 'm' in the resulting equation.
3. Substitute the value of 'm' into one of the original equations to solve for 'r'.

Here are the steps with the calculations:

1. Add the two equations:

42m + 55r = 127
66m - 52r = 44

Adding the two equations, we get:

108m = 171

2. Solve for 'm' in the resulting equation:

108m = 171

Dividing both sides by 108, we get:

m = 1.6

3. Substitute the value of 'm' into one of the original equations to solve for 'r':

42(1.6) + 55r = 127

Substituting m = 1.6, we get:

42(1.6) + 55r = 127

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

84 + 91r = 127

Subtracting 84 from both sides, we get:

91r = 43

Dividing both sides by 91, we get:

r = 0.47

Therefore, the values of 'r' and 'm' are:

r = 0.47
m = 1.6

### Answer: The values of 'r' and 'm' are 0.47 and 1.6, respectively.</pre>

First, we can solve the first equation for n:

31n + 64w = 120

Subtracting 64w from both sides gives:

31n = 120 - 64w

31n = 56

Dividing both sides by 31 gives:

n = 56/31

Now, we can substitute this value of n into the second equation:

57w + 71(56/31) = 173

Expanding and simplifying gives:

57w + 39 = 173

Subtracting 57w from both sides gives:

-38w = 34

Dividing both sides by -38 gives:

w = -34/38

Now, we can substitute this value of w into the first equation:

31(56/31) + 64(-34/38) = 120

Expanding and simplifying gives:

31(56/31) + 64(-34/38) = 120

31 + 64 = 120

35 = 120

We can simplify the first equation by combining like terms:

60z - 42(101 - 42z) = 13

Now, we can solve for z:

60z - 42(101 - 42z) = 13
60z - 42(63) = 13
60z - 252 = 13
60z = 13 + 252
60z = 265

Now, we can divide both sides by 60 to solve for z:

z = 265 / 60
z = 4.5

Now, we can substitute z = 4.5 into the first equation to solve for f:

f = (101 - 42z) / 45
f = (101 - 42(4.5)) / 45
f = 101 - 42(4.5) / 45
f = 101 - 18(4.5) / 45
f = 101 - 72 / 45
f = 101 - 1.6
f = 99.4

Therefore, the values of f and z are f = 99.4 and z = 4.5.</pre>

        Calculate the values of p and u from the following system of equations: 
26 * p - 21 * u = 6 
15 * p + 58 * u = 83.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables p and u. We can do this by adding the two equations and solving for p, and then substituting the value of p into one of the original equations to solve for u.

First, let's add the two equations:

26p - 21u = 6
15p + 58u = 83

26p - 21u + 15p + 58u = 6 + 83

41p = 109

Now, we can divide both sides by 41 to solve for p:

p = 109/41

Now that we have p, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for u:

26p - 21u = 6

26(109/41) - 21u = 6

2609/41 - 21u = 6

2609 - 21u = 6

2609 - 21u = 6

u = 2609 - 6

u = 2603

Therefore, the values of p and u are:

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

First, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get:

(69b - 50o) - (41o + 18b) = 55 - 85

This simplifies to:

-22b - 30o = -30

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by -22 to get:

b - 3o = -1

Now we can solve for b and o by adding 3o to both sides of the equation:

b = 3o + 1

Substituting this expression for b into the first equation, we get:

69(3o + 1) - 50o = 55

This simplifies to:

197o - 50o = 55

Now we can solve for o by adding 50o to both sides of the equation:

147o = 105

Now we can divide both sides of the equation by 147 to get:

o = 105/147

Now we can substitute this expression for o into the expression for b to get:

b = 3(105/147) + 1

This simplifies to:

b = 331/494 + 1

Now we can simplify the expression for b by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 494 to get:

b = 1579/494 + 1

Now we can simplify the expression for b by dividing both numerator and denominator by 494 to get:

Now, we can substitute this expression for l into the second equation:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables r and b.

First, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to get:

(17 * r) + (67 * b) = 103
(85 * r) + (67 * b) = 187

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation gives us:

(17 * r) - (85 * r) = 103 - 187
-68 * r = -86

r = -86/68

Now, we can substitute the value of r into one of the original equations to solve for b:

(17 * (-86/68)) + (67 * b) = 103

Simplifying and solving for b gives us:

b = 103 - (17 * (-86/68))
b = 103 + (1368/68)
b = 103 + 19
b = 122

Therefore, the values of r and b that satisfy the system of equations are:

r = -86/68
b = 122

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables t and n.

First, we can add the two equations together to get:

(85 * n) - (54 * t) + (38 * t) + (30 * n) = 41 + 126

This simplifies to:

(123 * n) + (84 * t) = 167

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 123 to get:

n + (84 * t) / 123 = 167 / 123

This simplifies to:

n + 7 = 127 / 123

Now, we can solve for n by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:

n = 127 / 123 - 7

n = 11

Now, we can substitute n = 11 into one of the original equations to solve for t:

(85 * 11) - (54 * t) = 41

This simplifies to:

85 * 11 - 54 * t = 41

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 54 to get:

11 * 85 / 54 - t = 41 / 54

This simplifies to:

22 - t = 41 / 54

Now, we can solve for t by subtracting 22 from both sides of the equation:

t = 41 / 54 - 22

t = 19

Therefore, the values of t and n are t = 19 and n = 11.</pre>

We can solve for u by dividing both sides by 75:

u = 5 / 75

Now, let's solve the second equation:

2) 48u + 25q = 140

We can solve for q by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

48u + 25q - 69q = 140

Simplifying, we get:

23u = 75

Now, we can solve for u by dividing both sides by 23:

u = 75 / 23

Now, we can substitute the value of u into the first equation to solve for q:

5 / 75 = 75 / 23

Now, we can solve for q by multiplying both sides by 23:

q = 5 * 23 / 75

Now, we can substitute the values of u and q into the first equation to verify that it is true:

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables v and x.

First, we can start by adding the two equations together:

(20 * v) + (17 * x) = 149
(24 * x) - (49 * v) = 22

Combined:

(20 * v) + (17 * x) + (24 * x) - (49 * v) = 149 + 22

Simplifying:

(20 * v) + (17 * x) + (24 * x) - (49 * v) = 161

Now, we can isolate the variable v by subtracting (24 * x) from both sides:

(20 * v) + (17 * x) - (49 * v) = 161 - (24 * x)

Simplifying:

(20 * v) - (49 * v) = 161 - (24 * x)

Now, we can solve for v by dividing both sides by 20:

v = (161 - (24 * x)) / 20

Simplifying:

v = 81 - (24 * x) / 20

Now, we can solve for x by substituting the expression for v into the second equation:

(24 * x) - (49 * (81 - (24 * x) / 20)) = 22

Simplifying:

(24 * x) - (49 * 81) + (24 * x) / 20 = 22

Now, we can solve for x by adding (24 * x) / 20 to both sides:

(24 * x) - (49 * 81) = 22 + (24 * x) / 20

Simplifying:

(24 * x) - (49 * 81) = 22 + (24 * x) / 20

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 24:

x = (22 + (24 * x) / 20) / 24

Simplifying:

x = (22 + (24 * x) / 20) / 24

Now, we can solve for x by substituting the expression for v into the equation:

x = (22 + (24 * (81 - (24 * x) / 20)) / 20) / 24

Simplifying:

x = (22 + (24 * 81) / 20) / 24

Now, we can solve for x by simplifying the fraction:

x = (22 + 1680) / 24

Simplifying:

x = 1692 / 24

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 24:

x = 70

Therefore, the values of v and x are:

v = 81 - (24 * 70) / 20 = 81 - 140 / 20 = 81 - 7 = 74
x = 70

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 39 to get:

t - 91/39 * g = 105/39

t = 105/39 + 91/39 * g

Subtracting 55o from both sides gives us:

6c = 57

Dividing both sides by 6 gives us:

c = 9

Now, we can substitute the value of c into the second equation:

55c - 48o = 36

Substituting c = 9 gives us:

55(9) - 48o = 36

55(9) - 48o = 36

545 - 48o = 36

Subtracting 48o from both sides gives us:

545 = 36 + 48o

545 = 84

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by -29 to get:

Now that we have found the value of f, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of r.

For example, we can substitute f = -64/29 into the first equation to get:

Simplifying the equation, we get:

        To find the values of x and a, solve the following system of simultaneous linear equations: 

First equation: 163 equals 50 times x plus a
Second equation: 24 equals 98 times x minus 84 times a.
    </p>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables x and a.

First equation:

163 = 50x + a

Subtracting 50x from both sides gives us:

-37 = a

Second equation:

24 = 98x - 84a

Adding 84a to both sides gives us:

120 = 98x

Dividing both sides by 98 gives us:

x = 120/98

Now that we have found x, we can substitute it into the first equation to find a:

163 = 50(120/98) + a

Simplifying and solving for a gives us:

a = 163 - 50(120/98)

a = 163 - 50(120/98)

a = 163 - 50(120/98)

Therefore, the values of x and a are:

x = 120/98
a = 163 - 50(120/98)

### Answer: x = 120/98, a = 163 - 50(120/98)</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables a and c.

First, we can add the two equations together to get:

33*a - 54*c = 20 + 24*a - 26*c = 29

This simplifies to:

57*a - 80*c = 49

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 57 to get:

a - 80*c = 49/57

This simplifies to:

a = 49/57 + 80*c

Now we can substitute the expression for a in terms of c into the first equation to get:

33*(49/57 + 80*c) - 54*c = 20

This simplifies to:

33*49/57 - 54*c = 20

This simplifies to:

177/57 - 54*c = 20

Now we can divide both sides of the equation by -54 to get:

177/57 = 20 + 54*c

This simplifies to:

177/57 = 20 + 54*c

Now we can solve for c to get:

c = (20 + 54*c) / 177

This simplifies to:

c = 20/177

Now we can substitute the value of c into the expression for a to get:

a = 49/57 + 80*20/177

This simplifies to:

a = 49/57 + 1600/177

This simplifies to:

a = 49/57 + 960/177

This simplifies to:

a = 49/57 + 576/177

This simplifies to:

a = 49/57 + 34

This simplifies to:

a = 83/57

Therefore, the values for a and c are a = 83/57 and c = 20/177.</pre>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Sure, I can help you solve this system of equations. To start, let's isolate one of the variables on each equation.

For the first equation, we can isolate d by subtracting 9j from both sides:

71d + 9j = 132
71d = 132 - 9j

Now, let's substitute this expression for d into the second equation:

43j - 84(132 - 9j) = 91
43j - 84(132) + 84(9j) = 91
43j - 1152 + 84(9j) = 91

Now, we can simplify the expression by combining like terms:

43j - 1152 + 84(9j) = 91
43j - 1152 + 756 = 91

Now, we can solve for j by adding 1152 to both sides:

43j = 91 + 1152
43j = 1043

Now, we can divide both sides by 43 to solve for j:

j = 1043 / 43
j = 24

Now, we can substitute j = 24 into the first equation to solve for d:

71d + 9(24) = 132
71d + 216 = 132
71d = 132 - 216
71d = -95

Now, we can divide both sides by 71 to solve for d:

d = -95 / 71
d = -1

Therefore, the solutions to the system of equations are d = -1 and j = 24.</pre>

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation gives us:

(81 * o) - (87 * n) = 20

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 81 to get:

o - n = 20/81

Now, we can solve for o and n by adding 20/81 to both sides of the equation:

o = 20/81 + n

Now, we can substitute the value of o into the first equation to solve for n:

(81 * (20/81 + n)) + (26 * n) = 163

Simplifying the equation, we get:

20 + (81 * n) + (26 * n) = 163

Now, we can simplify the equation further by combining like terms:

101 * n = 143

Dividing both sides of the equation by 101 gives us:

s = 11w + 4

Finally, we can substitute the expression for s in terms of w into the first equation to solve for w:

Next, we can solve the second equation for k:

39*i + 8*k = 193

39*i = 193 - 8*k

39*i = 185*k

Now, we can substitute the value of i from the first equation into the second equation:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables l and m.

First, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to get:

26m + 17l = 146
93m + l = 126

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation gives us:

17l = 146 - 126
17l = 20

Dividing both sides by 17 gives us:

l = 20/17
l = 1.18

Now, we can substitute the value of l into one of the original equations to solve for m.

26m + 17(1.18) = 146

Substituting the value of l into the equation gives us:

26m + 17(1.18) = 146
26m + 21.34 = 146

Subtracting 21.34 from both sides gives us:

26m = 124.66

Dividing both sides by 26 gives us:

m = 124.66/26
m = 4.8

        Determine the values of 'h' and 'f' by solving the following system of equations:

2) (29 * f) + (46 * h) = 119

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables 'h' and 'f' on one side of each equation.

First, let's solve the first equation for 'h':

1) (8 * f) + (39 * h) = 66

Subtracting 8f from both sides gives:

39h = 66 - 8f

Now, let's solve the second equation for 'f':

2) (29 * f) + (46 * h) = 119

Subtracting 29f from both sides gives:

46h = 119 - 29f

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'h' from the first equation into the second equation:

46(66 - 8f) = 119 - 29f

Expanding and simplifying gives:

294 - 352f = 119 - 29f

Subtracting 29f from both sides gives:

-163 = -29f

Dividing both sides by -29 gives:

f = 6

Now, we can substitute the value of 'f' into the first equation to solve for 'h':

39h = 66 - 8(6)

39h = 66 - 48

39h = 18

h = 18/39

Therefore, the values of 'h' and 'f' are:

h = 18/39
f = 6

k = (109 - 22 * b) / 23

Now, we can substitute this expression for k into the second equation:

62 * (109 - 22 * b) - 69 * b = 14

First, we can solve the first equation for b:

Subtracting 5 * k from both sides gives us:

(6 * b) = 105 - (5 * k)

Dividing both sides by 6 gives us:

b = (105 - (5 * k)) / 6

Now, we can substitute this expression for b into the second equation:

(95 * k) - (51 * (105 - (5 * k)) / 6) = 67

Expanding and simplifying the right-hand side gives us:

(95 * k) - (51 * 105 / 6) + (51 * 5 * k / 6) = 67

Combining like terms gives us:

(95 * k) - (51 * 105 / 6) + (255 * k / 6) = 67

Simplifying and solving for k gives us:

k = (67 - (95 * 105 / 6)) / (255 / 6)

k = (67 - 1575) / 127.5

k = -12.5

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of linear equations, we can use substitution or elimination.

Substitution Method:

Let's substitute the second equation into the first equation:

47 * v - 3 * k = 10
73 * v + 2 * k = 128

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

47 * v - 3 * k = 10
73 * v + 2 * k = 128

Substituting v = 128 / 73 and k = 10 / 47, we get:

v = 128 / 73
k = 10 / 47

Therefore, the values of v and k are 128/73 and 10/47, respectively.

Elimination Method:

We can also solve this system of linear equations using elimination.

First, we add the two equations to get:

47 * v - 3 * k = 10 + 128
73 * v + 2 * k = 128

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

73 * v + 2 * k = 128

Now, we can solve for v by dividing both sides by 73:

v = 128 / 73

Now, we can substitute the value of v into the first equation to solve for k:

47 * v - 3 * k = 10

Substituting v = 128 / 73, we get:

47 * (128 / 73) - 3 * k = 10

Simplifying, we get:

k = 10 / 47

Therefore, the values of v and k are 128/73 and 10/47, respectively.

        You are given the following system of equations:
The result of 89 multiplied by p minus 41 multiplied by q equals 60.
The result of 27 multiplied by p plus 91 multiplied by q equals 124.
What are the values of p and q?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can first solve the first equation for p:

89p - 41q = 60

Then, we can substitute this expression for p into the second equation:

27(89p - 41q) + 91q = 124

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2313p - 1241q = 124

Now, we can solve for p and q by dividing both sides of the equation by 1241:

p = 124/2313
q = 124/1241

So, the values of p and q are:

p = 0.053
q = 0.096

Therefore, the values of p and q are 0.053 and 0.096, respectively.</pre>

        Find the values of u and d that make these equations true:

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve these equations, we need to find the values of u and d that make both equations true.

First, let's solve the first equation:

(88 * u) - (96 * d) = 12

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

88u - 96d = 12

Next, we can add 96d to both sides of the equation to get:

88u = 12 + 96d

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 88 to get:

u = (12 + 96d) / 88

Now, let's solve the second equation:

(27 * u) + (36 * d) = 71

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

27u + 36d = 71

Next, we can subtract 36d from both sides of the equation to get:

27u = 71 - 36d

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 27 to get:

u = (71 - 36d) / 27

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (u and d). We can use substitution to solve for u and d.

First, let's substitute the expression for u in terms of d into the first equation:

(12 + 96d) / 88 = (71 - 36d) / 27

Now, we can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 88 and 27:

12 + 96d = 71 - 36d

Now, we can add 36d to both sides of the equation to get:

12 + 96d = 71

Now, we can subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to get:

96d = 59

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 96 to get:

d = 59 / 96

Now, we can substitute the expression for d into the expression for u to get:

u = (71 - 36d) / 27

Now, we can substitute the value of d into the expression for u to get:

u = (71 - 36(59/96)) / 27

Now, we can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides of the equation by 96 and 27:

u = (71 - 36(59/96)) / 27

Now, we can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides of the equation by 27:

u = (71 - 36(59/96))

Now, we can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides of the equation by 96:

u = (71 - 36(59/96)) * 96

Now, we can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides of the equation by 27:

u = (71 - 36(59/96)) * 96 * 27

Now, we can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides of the equation by 27:

u = (71 - 36(59/96)) * 96 * 27

Now, we can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides of the equation by 96:

u = (71 - 36(59/96)) * 96 * 27 * 96

Now, we can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides of the equation by 27:

u = (71 - 36(59/96)) * 96 * 27 * 96 * 27

Now, we can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides of the equation by 96:

u = (71 - 36(59/96)) * 96 * 27 * 96 * 27 * 96

        Solve the following system of equations for the values of f and n: 20 * n - 18 * f = 9

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables f and n.

First, we can add the two equations together to get:

20n - 18f = 9 + 3n - 2f = 70

This simplifies to:

20n - 18f = 81

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 20 to get:

n - 9f = 4

Now, we can solve for f by dividing both sides of the equation by n:

f = 4n - 9

Now that we have found f in terms of n, we can substitute this expression into one of the original equations to solve for n.

For example, we can substitute f = 4n - 9 into the first equation:

20n - 18(4n - 9) = 9

This simplifies to:

20n - 72n + 162 = 9

This simplifies to:

-52n + 162 = 0

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by -52 to get:

n = 162 / -52

This simplifies to:

n = -3

Now that we have found n, we can substitute this expression into the expression for f to solve for f:

f = 4n - 9

Substituting n = -3 into this expression gives us:

f = 4(-3) - 9

This simplifies to:

f = -12

Therefore, the values of f and n are f = -12 and n = -3.</pre>

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation gives us:

l = 1

140u = 137

Dividing both sides by 140 gives us:

u = 9/14

Now, we can substitute u = 9/14 into one of the original equations to solve for w.

For example, we can substitute u = 9/14 into the first equation:

74(9/14) + 11w = 116

This gives us:

11w = 116 - 74(9/14)

122f - 42j = 232

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 122 to get:

f - j = 232/122

f = 232/122 + j

Now, we can substitute the value of f into one of the original equations to solve for j.

For example, we can substitute the value of f into the first equation:

Expand and simplify:

39n = 154 + 24p

Now, we can equate the two equations to find the values of p and n:

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

35n = 129 - 57p - 154 - 24p

Simplifying, we get:

35n = -125 - 82p

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 35 to get:

n = -125/35 - 82p/35

Finally, we can substitute the value of n into one of the original equations to find the value of p:

The first equation is 83 * t - 58 * h = 45.
The second equation is 69 * h + 11 * t = 124.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables t and h.

First, we can solve the first equation for t:

83t - 58h = 45

Dividing both sides by 83, we get:

t = 45/83 + 58h/83

Now, we can substitute this expression for t into the second equation:

69h + 11(45/83 + 58h/83) = 124

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

69h + 11(45/83) + 69h + 11(58h/83) = 124

Combine like terms:

134h + 11(45/83 + 58h/83) = 124

Now, we can solve for h:

134h + 11(45/83 + 58h/83) = 124

Subtracting 11(45/83) from both sides, we get:

123h + 11(58h/83) = 113

Dividing both sides by 11, we get:

123h/11 + 58h/83 = 113/11

Subtracting 123h/11 from both sides, we get:

58h/83 = 102/11

Dividing both sides by 58, we get:

h/83 = 102/11/58

h = 102/11/58

Now, we can substitute this expression for h into the first equation:

t = 45/83 + 58h/83

Substituting h = 102/11/58, we get:

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11/58)/83

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)/83

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + 58(102/11)

t = 45/83 + </pre>

        Given the system of equations ((79 * h) - (61 * o)) = 9 and ((16 * h) - (12 * o)) = 9, what are the values of o and h?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

From the first equation, we can solve for h:

(79 * h) - (61 * o) = 9
(79 * h) = 9 + (61 * o)
h = (9 + (61 * o)) / 79

Simplifying, we get:

h = (9 + 61o) / 79

Now, we can substitute this expression for h into the second equation:

(16 * (9 + 61o) / 79) - (12 * o) = 9

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

(16 * 9 + 16 * 61o) / 79 - 12 * o = 9

Combine like terms:

(144 + 962o) / 79 - 12 * o = 9

Simplifying, we get:

(1006 + 962o) / 79 = 9

Now, we can solve for o:

(1006 + 962o) / 79 = 9
(962o) / 79 = 9 - 1006
o = (9 - 1006) / 962

Simplifying, we get:

o = -1007 / 962

Now, we can substitute this expression for o into the first equation:

(79 * h) - (61 * (-1007 / 962)) = 9
(79 * h) - (61 * -1007) / 962 = 9
(79 * h) - (61 * -1007) = 9

Simplifying, we get:

(79 * h) - 61007 = 9

Now, we can solve for h:

(79 * h) - 61007 = 9
79h - 61007 = 9

Simplifying, we get:

h = (61007 + 9) / 79

Simplifying, we get:

h = 61016 / 79

Now, we can substitute this expression for h into the first equation:

(79 * (61016 / 79)) - (61 * (-1007 / 962)) = 9
(61016) - (61 * -1007) = 9

Simplifying, we get:

(61016) - (61 * -1007) = 9

Now, we can solve for o:

(61016) - (61 * -1007) = 9
61016 - 61007 = 9

Simplifying, we get:

101 = 9

Now, we can substitute this expression for o into the first equation:

(79 * (61016 / 79)) - (61 * (101 / 962)) = 9
(61016) - (61 * 101) = 9

Simplifying, we get:

(61016) - (61016) = 9

Now, we can solve for h:

(61016) - (61016) = 9

Simplifying, we get:

0 = 9

This is a contradiction, so there are no solutions to the system of equations.

        Solve for variables s and y when the following system of equations is satisfied:

4 * y + 56 * s = 139

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve for variables s and y, we can first solve for y in the first equation.

4 * y + 56 * s = 139

Subtracting 4 * y from both sides gives us:

56 * s = 139 - 4 * y

Dividing both sides by 56 gives us:

s = (139 - 4 * y) / 56

Now, we can substitute this expression for s into the second equation:

65 * y - 90 * ((139 - 4 * y) / 56) = 16

Expanding and simplifying gives us:

65 * y - 90 * (139 - 4 * y) / 56 = 16

Combine like terms:

65 * y - 90 * 139 / 56 + 90 * 4 * y / 56 = 16

Simplify:

65 * y - 90 * 277 / 56 = 16

Subtract 90 * 277 / 56 from both sides:

65 * y = 16 + 90 * 277 / 56

Divide both sides by 65:

y = (16 + 90 * 277 / 56) / 65

Simplify:

y = 16 + 90 * 277 / 56

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the first equation:

4 * (16 + 90 * 277 / 56) + 56 * s = 139

Expand and simplify:

4 * 16 + 4 * 90 * 277 / 56 + 56 * s = 139

Combine like terms:

4 * 16 + 4 * 90 * 277 / 56 + 56 * s = 139

Simplify:

4 * 16 + 4 * 90 * 277 / 56 + 56 * s = 139

Now, we can solve for s:

56 * s = 139 - 4 * 16 - 4 * 90 * 277 / 56

Simplify:

56 * s = 139 - 64 - 3600

Subtract 64 from both sides:

56 * s = 139 - 3600

Divide both sides by 56:

s = (139 - 3600) / 56

Simplify:

s = -277 / 56

Now, we can substitute this expression for s into the first equation:

4 * y + 56 * (-277 / 56) = 139

Expand and simplify:

4 * y + 56 * (-277 / 56) = 139

Combine like terms:

4 * y + 56 * (-277 / 56) = 139

Simplify:

4 * y + 56 * (-277 / 56) = 139

Now, we can solve for y:

4 * y = 139 - 56 * (-277 / 56)

Expand and simplify:

4 * y = 139 + 56 * 277 / 56

Combine like terms:

4 * y = 139 + 1512

Simplify:

4 * y = 1551

Divide both sides by 4:

y = 1551 / 4

Simplify:

y = 387.5

Therefore, the values of s and y are:

s = -277 / 56
y = 387.5</pre>

40d + 45z = 162

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation gives us:

40d - 42d = 162 - 75

Simplifying the equation gives us:

-2d = 87

Dividing both sides by -2 gives us:

d = -43

Now, we can substitute the value of d into one of the original equations to solve for z. Let's substitute d = -43 into the first equation:

42(-43) - 4z = 75

Simplifying the equation gives us:

-1728 + 4z = 75

Subtracting 1728 from both sides gives us:

-4z = -1653

Dividing both sides by -4 gives us:

z = 413

Therefore, the values of d and z are d = -43 and z = 413.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables 'a' and 'o' on one side of each equation.

First equation:

(42 * o) + (24 * a) = 142

Subtracting 24a from both sides gives us:

(42 * o) = 142 - 24a

Simplifying, we get:

42o = 118 - 24a

Now, we can divide both sides by 42 to get:

o = (118 - 24a) / 42

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'o' into the second equation:

(42 * a) + (6 * (118 - 24a) / 42) = 75

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

42a + 6(118 - 24a) / 42 = 75

Combine like terms:

42a + 6(118 - 24a) = 75

Subtract 24a from both sides:

42a = 75 - 6(118 - 24a)

Simplify:

42a = 75 - 6(90)

42a = 75 - 540

42a = -465

First, we can solve the first equation for z:

(71 * z) + (60 * n) = 184

Subtracting 60n from both sides gives us:

(71 * z) = 184 - 60n

Dividing both sides by 71 gives us:

Now, we can substitute this expression for z into the second equation:

(52 * (184 - 60n) / 71) - (47 * n) = 19

Expanding and simplifying gives us:

(52 * 184 / 71) - (47 * n) = 19

Subtracting 47n from both sides gives us:

(52 * 184 / 71) = 19 + 47n

Dividing both sides by 52 gives us:

184 / 71 = (19 + 47n) / 52

Multiplying both sides by 71 gives us:

184 = (19 + 47n) * 52 / 71

Subtracting 19 from both sides gives us:

165 = (47n) * 52 / 71

Dividing both sides by 47 gives us:

n = 165 / (47 * 52 / 71)

n = 165 / 19

n = 8.5

Now that we have found the value of n, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find the value of z:

z = (184 - 60n) / 71

z = (184 - 60(8.5)) / 71

z = 184 / 71

z = 2.5

99z - 84(189 - 90z) / 70 = 20

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

99z - 166z + 70 = 20

Now, we can solve for z:

z = (20 + 70) / (99 - 166)

z = 1/3

Now, we can substitute this value for z into the first equation to find the value of e:

e = (189 - 90(1/3)) / 70

e = 189 / 210

Therefore, the values of e and z are:

e = 189 / 210
z = 1/3

### Answer: e = 189/210, z = 1/3</pre>

        Find the values of o and f that satisfy the following system of equations:

1) 26o - 44f = 95
2) 87f + 11o = 169.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables o and f.

First, we can add the two equations to get:

26o - 44f = 95
87f + 11o = 169

26o - 87f = 169 - 95

-61f = 74

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by -61 to get:

f = 74/61

Now, we can substitute the value of f into one of the original equations to solve for o:

26o - 44(74/61) = 95

26o - 32 = 95

o = 63

Therefore, the values of o and f that satisfy the system of equations are:

o = 63
f = 74/61

        Calculate the values of z and p using the following system of equations: 40*z - 20*p = 51
 6*z + 58*p = 165.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables z and p.

First, we can solve the first equation for z:

z = (51 + 20p) / 40

Now, we can substitute this expression for z into the second equation:

6(51 + 20p) / 40 + 58p = 165

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

305 + 100p = 165

Subtracting 305 from both sides, we get:

100p = 35

Dividing both sides by 100, we get:

p = 35/100

Now, we can substitute the value of p back into the first equation to solve for z:

z = (51 + 20(35/100)) / 40

Simplifying, we get:

z = 51 / 40

Therefore, the values of z and p are:

z = 51 / 40
p = 35/100

        Find the values of s and f from the given system of equations:

(71 * s) - (89 * f) = 5 
(3 * f) + (10 * s) = 93.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to isolate the variables s and f.

First, we can solve the first equation for s:

s = (5 + 89f) / 71

Now, we can substitute this expression for s into the second equation:

(3f + 10(5 + 89f)/71) = 93

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

3f + 30f + 890f/71 = 93

Combine like terms:

423f/71 = 93

Now, we can divide both sides by 71 to solve for f:

f = 93/423

Now, we can substitute this expression for f into the first equation to solve for s:

s = (5 + 89(93/423)) / 71

Simplifying, we get:
