Distance traveled = 775.644 miles
Fuel consumed = 43.6 gallons

Miles per gallon = Distance traveled / Fuel consumed

            Eva has a garden that is 3 meters wide. She decides to extend it by 22.6 meters. After she does this, she has a garden that is as long as the width of the original garden times the total length after the extension. What is now the total area of Eva's garden in square meters?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the original width of Eva's garden &quot;w&quot; and the total length after the extension &quot;l&quot;.

We know that the total area of the garden is equal to the width times the length: A = wl.

After the extension, the total length is equal to the original length plus the extension: l = w + 22.6.

Substituting this expression for l into the equation for the area, we get:

A = w(w + 22.6)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

A = 2w^2 + 45.2w

Now, we know that the original width of Eva's garden is 3 meters, so we can substitute this value into the expression for the area:

A = 2(3)^2 + 45.2(3)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

A = 18 + 138.6

A = 156.6

Therefore, the total area of Eva's garden after the extension is 156.6 square meters.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Sarah bought 9 books, each costing $27.99, so the total cost of the books is 9 x $27.99 = $259.91.
Sarah also bought a magazine, which cost $9.
The total cost of Sarah's purchase is the sum of the cost of the books and the cost of the magazine, which is $259.91 + $9 = $268.91.

John has $19 in his wallet, and he finds $5 on the street, so he now has a total of $19 + $5 = $24.

He then discovers a forgotten envelope with $27.97 in it, so he now has a total of $24 + $27.97 = $51.97.

He buys 17 vintage comic books, each costing the total amount he currently has in his wallet, which is $51.97.

Total distance traveled = 436.23179999999996 miles
Total amount of gas used = 46.26 gallons

Average mileage per gallon of gas used = Total distance traveled / Total amount of gas used

1. The enemy hits you and you lose 3.4 health points, so you have 18 - 3.4 = 14.6 health points left.
2. For every remaining health point, your character's strength level increases by a 46 points multiplier, so you have 14.6 x 46 = 704 strength points.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous scenario, you discovered that you'd actually found 25 of these rare coins in your grandmother's house, not just 3. Each coin can still be sold for 10 dollars and the auction fees remain at 5.1 dollars. How much money will you have left after paying the auction fees?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the total value of the coins $x.

Since each coin is worth $10, the total value of the coins is $10 \* 25 = $250.

After paying the auction fees of $5.10, the remaining amount is $250 - $5.10 = $244.90.
