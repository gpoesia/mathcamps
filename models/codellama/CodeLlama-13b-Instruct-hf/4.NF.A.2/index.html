    <pre class="model-raw-response">  The first fraction is 3/2 and the second fraction is 9/10.

To compare the two fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is 20.

So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

3/2 = 6/20
9/10 = 18/20

        Let's consider a slight change to our previous fractions problem. This time, fill in the blank to compare these two fractions: 

(3 / 7) _ (9 / 10)

Is the comparison the same or different than the comparison between 3 / 2 and 9 / 10? Think about the impact of decreasing the numerator of our first fraction on the comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  The comparison between (3/7) and (9/10) is different than the comparison between 3/2 and 9/10.

When we compare (3/7) and (9/10), we find that the numerators are both less than the denominators, so we can compare the fractions directly. The fraction with the larger numerator is greater.

In this case, (3/7) &lt; (9/10).

However, when we compare 3/2 and 9/10, we find that the denominators are different, so we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators to compare the fractions. The LCM of 2 and 10 is 20, so we can rewrite the fractions as:

3/2 = 6/20
9/10 = 18/20

Now, we can compare the numerators:

6 &gt; 18

Therefore, the fraction with the larger numerator is greater.

In this case, 3/2 &gt; 9/10.

So, the comparison between (3/7) and (9/10) is different than the comparison between 3/2 and 9/10. The impact of decreasing the numerator of our first fraction on the comparison is that it makes the fraction less than the second fraction, whereas decreasing the denominator of our first fraction makes the fraction greater than the second fraction.</pre>

        Now, let's consider a slight change in the problem. 
Fill in the blank 
(1 / 5) _ (2 / 1)
with &lt;, &gt;, or = to compare the two fractions. This time, suppose you're comparing one fifth of your initially available sweets against two whole sweets someone offered you. Which is greater or are they equal?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  (1 / 5) &lt; (2 / 1)

Explanation:

The fraction (1 / 5) represents one fifth of the sweets that were initially available.
The fraction (2 / 1) represents two whole sweets that were offered.

Since one fifth of the sweets is less than two whole sweets, we can write:

(1 / 5) &lt; (2 / 1)

Therefore, the fractions are not equal, and the first fraction is less than the second fraction.</pre>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To compare the two fractions in the equation (7 / 1) _ (4 / 2), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.

The LCM of 1 and 2 is 2.

So, we can rewrite the equation as:

(7 / 2) _ (4 / 2)

Now, we can compare the two fractions by multiplying the numerators and denominators:

(7 × 2) / (4 × 2) = (14 / 4)

Therefore, the equation is equal to (14 / 4).</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To compare the fractions in the expression (10/7) _ (9/6), we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is 42.

(10/7) = 10/42
(9/6) = 9/42

Now, we can compare the fractions by multiplying both numerators by the LCM:

(10/7) _ (9/6) = (10 \* 42)/(7 \* 42) _ (9 \* 42)/(6 \* 42)
= (420)/(28 \* 42) _ (36)/(6 \* 42)
= (420)/(28) _ (36)/(6)

Since (420)/(28) &gt; (36)/(6), we can say that (10/7) &gt; (9/6).

Explanation:

The fraction (4 / 6) is less than (6 / 10) because the numerator of (4 / 6) is smaller than the numerator of (6 / 10).</pre>

        Compare the two fractions by filling the blank using &lt;, &gt;, or =. Here's the question:

(9 / 6) _ (6 / 8)

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  (9 / 6) &lt; (6 / 8)

Explanation:

(9 / 6) = 1.5
(6 / 8) = 0.75

Since 1.5 is less than 0.75, we can say that (9 / 6) is less than (6 / 8).</pre>

Explanation:

(2/6) = 1/3

Since 1/3 is less than 8/7, we can write:

        Now think about a slightly different situation:
Compare the two fractions below by filling the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =.

(2 / 7) _ (8 / 7)

This time, instead of 2 out of 6 parts of a pizza, suppose you only got 2 out of 7 parts while the rest was still 8 out of 7. What would be the comparison between the two fractions then?

3. Compare the numerators: 12 &gt; 6, so 6/7 &gt; 3/1.
