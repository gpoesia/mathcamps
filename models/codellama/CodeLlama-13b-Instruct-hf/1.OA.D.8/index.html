            After a birthday party, you see one piece of cake left. If you originally had a whole cake that was cut into h slices, and each slice was equal in size, then how many slices were there in the whole cake, given that 12 pieces have been eaten during the party?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: If the cake was cut into h slices, and each slice was equal in size, then the total number of slices in the cake is h.

Since 12 pieces of cake have been eaten during the party, and each piece is equal to one slice, then the total number of slices eaten is 12.

Therefore, the total number of slices in the cake is h - 12, or h - 12 slices.

Let's call the number of people at the party before anyone left &quot;x&quot;.

We know that 3 people left early, so the number of people who left is 3.

We also know that 15 people remained at the party after the 3 people left, so the number of people who remained is 15.

We can set up the equation:

x - 3 = 15

To solve for x, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation:

x = 15 + 3

x = 18

So, there were 18 people at the party before anyone left.

We know that the total number of apple trees after the planting is 18, so we can set up the equation:

9 + x = 18

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:

x = 9

Therefore, the farmer planted 9 new apple trees.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The number of pens added to the display during the day is the difference between the number of pens at the end of the day and the number of pens at the start of the day.

Number of pens at the end of the day: 8

Difference: 8 - 3 = 5

Therefore, the store added 5 pens to the display during the day.

We know that the total number of jackets the family has now is 12, so we can set up the equation:

6 + x = 12

Simplifying the equation:

x = 6

So, the Jackson family purchased 6 jackets at the yard sale.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's call the length of the first rope &quot;x&quot; meters. We know that the total length of the two ropes is 19 meters, so we can set up the equation:

x + y = 19

where y is the length of the second rope.

We also know that the first rope is 13 meters long, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

13 + y = 19

Now we can solve for y:

y = 19 - 13
y = 6

So the second rope is 6 meters long.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's call the number of beach balls brought by the visitors &quot;x&quot;.

We know that there were 2 beach balls scattered around the beach early in the morning. So, the total number of beach balls at that time was 2.

As the day progressed, there were 12 beach balls all over the beach. So, the total number of beach balls at the end of the day was 12.

We can set up the equation:

2 + x = 12

where x is the number of beach balls brought by the visitors.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 10

So, the beach visitors brought 10 beach balls with them.</pre>

We know that the customer bought at least 1 guitar, because the customer came to the store and bought something.

We also know that the customer bought at most 17 guitars, because there were 18 guitars in stock and the customer bought x guitars, so the total number of guitars sold is x + 18.

We are given that there are 16 guitars left at the end of the day, so we can set up the equation:

x + 18 = 16

Solving for x, we get:

x = 17

So the customer bought 17 guitars.</pre>

x &lt; 11

            A snowman has a certain number of snowballs stacked to form its shape. If 7 snowballs are removed, only 11 snowballs remain. How many snowballs were used to build the snowman originally?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's say the snowman had x snowballs originally.

If 7 snowballs are removed, then the number of snowballs remaining is x - 7.

We know that the number of snowballs remaining is 11, so we can set up the equation:

x - 7 = 11

To solve for x, we can add 7 to both sides of the equation:

x = 11 + 7

x = 18

So, the snowman had 18 snowballs originally.</pre>

            In underwater kingdom, there were 10 mermaids at the beginning. After a while, there were 20 mermaids. How many new mermaids joined the kingdom?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The number of new mermaids joined the kingdom is the difference between the number of mermaids at the end and the number of mermaids at the beginning.

Number of mermaids at the end: 20
Number of mermaids at the beginning: 10

Difference: 20 - 10 = &lt;&lt;20-10=10&gt;&gt;10 new mermaids joined the kingdom.
