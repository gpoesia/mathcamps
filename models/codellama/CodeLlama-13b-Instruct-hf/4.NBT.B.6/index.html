        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The wizard will have 932 - (193 x number of creatures) stones left.
Let's say he summons x creatures.
Then, the number of stones he will have left will be:
932 - (193 x x) = 932 - 193x

We need to find the value of x that makes the expression equal to 0.

193x = 932 - 932
193x = -1

x = -1/193

So, the wizard will have -1/193 stones left.

            A builder has a job to install 660 square foot tiles in a house. Each tile can cover 335 square feet. After installing tiles evenly across the available space, how many square feet will the last tile need to cover?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The total area of the tiles to be installed is 660 square feet.
The area of each tile is 335 square feet.

To find the number of tiles needed, we can divide the total area by the area of each tile:

660 / 335 = 2

Therefore, the builder will need to install 2 tiles.

To find the area of the last tile, we can subtract the area of the other tiles from the total area:

660 - (2 x 335) = 660 - 670 = 90

Therefore, the last tile will need to cover 90 square feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's first find out how many beach bags are needed to hold all the beach balls. We can do this by dividing the total number of beach balls by the number of beach balls that can fit in each bag.

891 beach balls / 119 beach balls per bag = 7.5 bags

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 8 bags.

Now, let's find out how many beach balls will not fit in the bags. We can do this by subtracting the total number of beach balls from the number of beach balls that will fit in the bags.

891 beach balls - (8 bags x 119 beach balls per bag) = 891 - 988 = 103 beach balls

So, 103 beach balls will not fit in the bags and will be left over.

278 / 446 = 0.62

So, there will be 0.62 clusters.

To find the number of stars that will remain ungrouped, we can subtract the number of stars in each cluster from the total number of stars:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the number of letters in each mailbox &quot;x&quot;. Since the postman has to deliver 891 letters, we can write the equation:

891 = 616x

To find the number of letters that will remain in the last mailbox, we need to find the remainder when dividing 891 by 616. We can do this by finding the remainder when dividing 891 by 616 and then subtracting the number of letters in each mailbox from the total number of letters.

Remainder = 891 % 616 = 295

Number of letters in each mailbox = 616

Total number of letters = 891

Number of letters that will remain in the last mailbox = 891 - 616x = 891 - 616(295) = 891 - 19650 = -19621

So, there will be -19621 letters remaining in the last mailbox.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's say the frog jumps x times.

Since the frog eats 258 flies each time it jumps, the total number of flies eaten by the frog is 258x.

Since there are 941 flies in total, the total number of flies left after the frog has eaten all of them is:

941 - 258x = 0

Solving for x, we get:

x = 941 / 258 = 3.6

Since the frog can only jump a whole number of times, the frog jumps 3 times.

Therefore, there are 258 x 3 = 864 flies left after the frog has eaten all of them.

Since each bottle can hold 1.15 liters, we can round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 liter per bottle.

Now, let's find out how many liters will overflow:

193 liters - (167 bottles x 1 liter per bottle) = 193 liters - 167 liters = 26 liters

To find the number of bales left for the last barn, we need to find the number of bales that can be stored in each barn. Since each barn can store up to 259 bales, we can divide the total number of bales by the number of barns to find the average number of bales that can be stored in each barn:

330 bales / 5 barns = 66 bales per barn

Since we want to store the bales as evenly as possible, we can round down to the nearest whole number:

66 bales per barn = 66 bales

Now, we can find the number of bales that will be left for the last barn by subtracting the total number of bales that can be stored in all the other barns from the total number of bales:

330 bales - (66 bales x 4 barns) = 330 bales - 272 bales = 58 bales

Let's first find the number of sets that can be formed:

Number of sets = Total number of shells / Number of shells in each set
= 999 / 474
= 2

Now, let's find the number of shells that will be left without a set:

Number of shells without a set = Total number of shells - (Number of sets x Number of shells in each set)
= 999 - (2 x 474)
= 999 - 948

Let's first find the number of sets that can be formed:

Number of sets = Total number of shells / Number of shells in each set

Since there is no fractional number of sets that can be formed, we round down to 0.

Now, let's find the number of shells that will be left after attempting to form these sets:

Number of shells left = Total number of shells - (Number of sets x Number of shells in each set)

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The factory produces 369 teddy bears in a day.
Each box can hold 270 teddy bears.

To find out how many boxes are needed to hold all the teddy bears, we can divide the total number of teddy bears by the number of teddy bears that can fit in a box:

369 teddy bears / 270 teddy bears per box = 1.35 boxes

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number:

1.35 boxes = 2 boxes

Therefore, 2 boxes will be needed to hold all the teddy bears.

To find out how many teddy bears will be left over, we can subtract the total number of teddy bears from the number of teddy bears that can fit in the boxes:

369 teddy bears - (2 boxes x 270 teddy bears per box) = 369 teddy bears - 540 teddy bears = -171 teddy bears

Therefore, there will be -171 teddy bears left over.

Since we can't have a fraction of a snowman, we'll round down to 4.

So, 4 snowmen can be built with the given number of snowballs.

Let's call the number of marshmallows produced in a minute &quot;x&quot;.
Since the packaging machine can only hold 957 marshmallows at a time, we know that the number of marshmallows left un-packaged will be equal to &quot;x&quot; - 957.

We are given that the marshmallow factory produces 998 marshmallows per minute, so we can set up the equation:

x - 957 = 998

To solve for &quot;x&quot;, we can add 957 to both sides of the equation:

x = 998 + 957

x = 1955

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's first find out how many boxes of cheese we can fit in the dairy shop. We can do this by dividing the total number of blocks of cheese by the number of blocks that fit in each box.

686 blocks / 349 blocks per box = 1.97 boxes

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll round down to 1 box. So, we can fit 1 box of cheese in the dairy shop.

Now, let's find out how many blocks of cheese will be left over after all the boxes are filled. We can do this by subtracting the total number of blocks of cheese from the number of blocks that fit in the boxes.

686 blocks - 349 blocks per box = 337 blocks

So, there will be 337 blocks of cheese left over after all the boxes are filled.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's say the factory has x shops.

Total number of chairs = 380

Number of chairs per shop = 380 / x

Since each shop can only hold 310 chairs, the number of chairs left at the factory will be:

380 - (310 x x) = 380 - 310x

We need to find the value of x that makes the above equation true.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 380 / 310

x = 1.23

So, there will be 1.23 shops.

Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get:

x = 2

Therefore, there will be 2 shops left at the factory.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The wizard has 999 spells in his book.
He wants to distribute them equally among 951 apprentice wizards.
Since 999 does not divide evenly by 951, there will be some apprentices who receive more spells than others.
Let's say the wizard gives x spells to each apprentice.
Then, the total number of spells given out will be 951x.
Since the wizard has 999 spells in his book, we can set up the equation:
999 = 951x
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 951:
x = 999/951
x = 10
So, each apprentice will receive 10 spells.
The wizard will have 999 - 10(951) = 999 - 9510 = 499 spells left after giving out as many spells as he can to his apprentices.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The total number of scooters produced is 767.
The number of scooters that can be carried by each truck is 369.
To distribute the scooters evenly among the trucks, we need to divide the total number of scooters by the number of trucks.

Number of trucks = Total number of scooters / Number of scooters that can be carried by each truck
Number of trucks = 767 / 369
Number of trucks = 2

Now, let's find out how many scooters will be left after all the trucks are loaded:

Number of scooters left = Total number of scooters - (Number of scooters that can be carried by each truck x Number of trucks)
Number of scooters left = 767 - (369 x 2)
Number of scooters left = 767 - 738

            There are 846 water droplets in a cloud. Each raindrop needs 722 droplets to form. If all droplets are used to form raindrops, how many droplets would be left unconverted in the cloud after reaching the maximum number of rain drops?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's first find the maximum number of raindrops that can be formed from the given number of water droplets.

Number of raindrops = Number of water droplets / Number of droplets required to form a raindrop
= 846 / 722
= 1.15

Since we can't have a fraction of a raindrop, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Maximum number of raindrops = 1 + 1 = 2

Now, let's find the number of water droplets that would be left unconverted in the cloud after reaching the maximum number of raindrops.

Number of water droplets left unconverted = Total number of water droplets - (Maximum number of raindrops x Number of droplets required to form a raindrop)
= 846 - (2 x 722)
= 846 - 1444
= -600

Since we can't have negative water droplets, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of water droplets left unconverted = -600 + 1 = 599

Therefore, there would be 599 water droplets left unconverted in the cloud after reaching the maximum number of raindrops.

Let's say there are x players left waiting after filling all the matches.

Since only 383 players can enter a match at a time, the number of matches that can be filled is:

923 / 383 = 2.31 matches

Since we can't have a fraction of a match, we round up to 3 matches.

So, there will be 923 - (3 x 383) = 923 - 1231 = -308 players left waiting after filling all the matches.

Therefore, the number of cannonballs left uncrated is 923 - (499 x 2) = &lt;&lt;923-(499 x 2)=923-998&gt;&gt;923-998 = 23.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The total rainfall of 612 inches is divided by 29 days, which gives us an average rainfall of 21.6 inches per day.
To make the days evenly rainy, we need to find the number of inches of rain that would be left over after 29 days of even rainfall.
We can do this by subtracting the total rainfall from the number of inches of rain that would be left over after 29 days of even rainfall.

21.6 x 29 = 642.4

612 - 642.4 = -29.4

Therefore, there would be -29.4 inches of rain left over after 29 days of even rainfall.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The number of boxes that can be loaded onto each truck is 371. Since the total number of boxes is 514, we can calculate the number of trucks needed to deliver all the boxes as follows:

514 / 371 = 1.37

Since we can't have a fraction of a truck, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2.

So, 2 trucks will be needed to deliver all the boxes.

Now, let's calculate the number of boxes that will be left over:

514 - (2 x 371) = 514 - 742 = -228

Since we can't have a negative number of boxes, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 0.

So, there will be 0 boxes left over.

The production run of toy cars is 735.
The packs are 348 cars each.

To find the number of full packs, we can divide the production run by the number of cars in a pack:

735 / 348 = 2

Therefore, there will be 2 full packs of 348 toy cars.

To find the number of toy cars that will be left over after all full packs have been filled, we can subtract the number of cars in a full pack from the production run:

735 - 348 = 387

There will be 387 toy cars left over after all full packs have been filled.

We know that the total number of animals is 386, and each territory can support 95 animals.

To find the number of animals in the last not fully occupied territory, we can use the following equation:

386 = 95x + (number of animals in the last not fully occupied territory)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 386 - 95x

673 beads / 49 beads per bracelet = 14 bracelets

So, the jewelry maker can make 14 bracelets with the exact number of beads.

To find out how many beads she will have left after creating all the bracelets, we can subtract the total number of beads used for all the bracelets from the total number of beads:

673 beads - (14 bracelets x 49 beads per bracelet) = 673 beads - 708 beads = -35 beads

The total number of calls received by the police station is 927.
The number of operators is 311.

To divide the calls equally among the operators, we can use the following formula:

927 / 311 = 3

This means that each operator will handle 3 calls.

The last operator will handle the remaining calls, which is:

927 - (311 x 3) = 927 - 933 = 9

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's first find out how many storage units are needed to store all the robots:

820 robots / 684 robots per storage unit = 1.17 storage units

Since we can't store a fraction of a storage unit, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:

1.17 storage units = 2 storage units

Now, let's find out how many robots will not fit in the storage units:

820 robots - (2 storage units x 684 robots per storage unit) = 820 robots - 1,376 robots = -556 robots

Since we can't have a negative number of robots, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:

-556 robots = 0 robots

Therefore, all 820 robots will fit in the storage units.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the number of droplets left after each cycle &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the cloud loses water droplets at an equal rate, so the number of droplets lost in each cycle is the same. Let's call this number &quot;y&quot;.

We also know that the cloud becomes entirely dry after every 289 droplets. This means that the number of droplets left after each cycle is 289 - y.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

x = 289 - y

We know that the initial number of droplets is 516. So, we can substitute this value into the equation:

516 = 289 - y

Solving for y, we get:

y = 289 - 516
y = -227

So, the number of droplets lost in each cycle is -227.

Now, we can find the number of droplets left after the final cycle by substituting this value into the equation:

x = 289 - (-227)
x = 289 + 227
x = 516

Therefore, there will be 516 droplets left when the cloud is dry after the final cycle.

            On a pirate ship, there are 995 gold coins that need to be evenly divided among the 267 pirates. If they split the gold up as evenly as possible, how many gold coins will be left over?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To divide the gold coins evenly among the pirates, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 995 and 267. The GCD is the largest number that divides both 995 and 267 without leaving a remainder.

To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:

995 = 267 Ã— 3 + 182
267 = 182 Ã— 1 + 85
182 = 85 Ã— 2 + 37
85 = 37 Ã— 2 + 7
37 = 7 Ã— 5 + 0

So, the GCD of 995 and 267 is 7.

Now, we can divide 995 by 7 to find the number of gold coins each pirate will receive:

995 Ã· 7 = 141

So, each pirate will receive 141 gold coins.

There will be 995 - (267 Ã— 141) = 995 - 39,995 = 9055 gold coins left over.

            A pillow factory produces 589 pillows per day. They package these pillows in boxes, and each box holds 198 pillows. If they pack as many full boxes as possible, how many pillows will be left outside the boxes at the end of the day?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The number of pillows that can be packed in a full box is 198.
The number of pillows produced per day is 589.

To find the number of full boxes that can be packed, we can divide the number of pillows produced per day by the number of pillows that can be packed in a full box:

589 / 198 = 3

So, 3 full boxes can be packed.

To find the number of pillows that will be left outside the boxes at the end of the day, we can multiply the number of pillows that can be packed in a full box by the number of full boxes that can be packed:

198 x 3 = 582

So, there will be 582 pillows left outside the boxes at the end of the day.

Let x be the number of children who can go down the slide without rest.

We know that 771 children can go down the slide without rest, so x = 771.

We also know that 923 children want to slide down the slide, so the total number of children who want to slide down the slide is 923.

Subtracting x from 923 gives us the number of children who will be left waiting for their turn:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The tailor uses 529 meters of fabric to make each dress. Therefore, the total amount of fabric used for all the dresses is 529 x 2 = 1058 meters.

The tailor has 925 meters of fabric. Therefore, the amount of fabric left over after completing the dresses is 925 - 1058 = 87 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the number of tourists wanting to explore the castle &quot;x&quot;.

We know that each tour group can accommodate up to 530 people, so the total number of people in all the tour groups is 530x.

Since there are 976 tourists wanting to explore the castle, we can set up the equation:

530x = 976

Solving for x, we get:

x = 976 / 530

x = 1.9

So, there will be 1.9 tourists left for the last group of the day.

### Answer: 1.9</pre>
