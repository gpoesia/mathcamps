Total number of passengers = 378 + 254 = &lt;&lt;378+254=632&gt;&gt;632 passengers.

If 240 passengers got off at the next station from both trains combined, then the total number of passengers on both trains is reduced by 240.

Total number of passengers - 240 = 632 - 240 = &lt;&lt;632-240=392&gt;&gt;392 passengers.

            Let's suppose that there were originally 224 oranges in the fruit store. However, instead of receiving a fresh batch of 696 oranges from the farm, they only receive a batch of 356 oranges. How many oranges are there in the store now?

2. To find the number of animals that were in the reserve section, we need to subtract the number of animals that the zoo lost from the total number of animals in the reserve section (848).

1. The number of butterflies that left the sanctuary due to hazards is 53.
2. The number of butterflies that left the sanctuary due to sudden change in weather conditions is 708.
3. The total number of butterflies that left the sanctuary is the sum of the two numbers: 53 + 708 = 761.
4. The initial number of butterflies in the sanctuary is 983.
5. The number of butterflies left in the sanctuary is the initial number minus the total number of butterflies that left: 983 - 761 = 222.

Therefore, there are 222 butterflies left in the sanctuary now.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: In this new situation, the baby was initially receiving 380 milliliters of milk each day. To increase the milk intake by 18 milliliters, we need to add 18 milliliters to the current amount.

So, the baby will receive 380 + 18 = &lt;&lt;380+18=408&gt;&gt;408 milliliters of milk each day after the increase.
### Answer: 408 milliliters</pre>

            Suppose that instead of a bus with 399 seats, the bus service rerouted a bigger bus with 747 seats for maintenance. If the same number of 29 seats were unavailable due to maintenance, how many seats would be available for passengers in the bigger bus?
