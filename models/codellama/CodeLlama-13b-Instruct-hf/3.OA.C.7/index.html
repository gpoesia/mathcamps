            In an experiment, it is determined that the fuel needed for a rocket is a product of the mass of that rocket and 12. If the mass of the rocket is 8, how much fuel is needed for the rocket?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The formula for the fuel needed for a rocket is m \* 12, where m is the mass of the rocket.

Substituting the given value of m (8) into the formula, we get:

8 \* 12 = 96

Therefore, the fuel needed for the rocket is 96 units.

            In a further experiment, a third rocket with the same mass of 8 is tested, but this time it is equipped with an improved fuel system that requires less fuel. Now, this rocket requires only 5 units of fuel per mass. How much fuel is this third rocket going to need?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The formula for the fuel needed for a rocket is m \* 12, where m is the mass of the rocket.

Since the third rocket has the same mass as the first two rockets (8), we can use the same formula to calculate the fuel needed for this rocket. However, since the fuel system has been improved, the amount of fuel needed per mass is now 5 units instead of 12.

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

8 \* 5 = 40

Therefore, the third rocket will need 40 units of fuel.

Number of starfish = 81
Number of tanks = 9

To divide 81 by 9, we can use the following steps:

1. Divide 81 by 9 to get 9.
2. Multiply 9 by 9 to get 81.

Therefore, there will be 9 starfish in each tank.

Spectra's strength = 5 x 5 x Green Gauntlet's original strength

New beads = Original beads x 8

In this case, the original design required 6 beads, so we can substitute this value into the formula:

Total milk produced = 72 liters
Number of days = 12 days

Milk produced per day = Total milk produced / Number of days
Milk produced per day = 72 liters / 12 days
Milk produced per day = 6 liters

Now, to find out how much milk the cow will produce in 12 days, we can multiply the amount of milk produced per day by the number of days.

Total milk produced in 12 days = Milk produced per day x Number of days
Total milk produced in 12 days = 6 liters x 12 days
Total milk produced in 12 days = 72 liters

Total milk produced in 12 days = Milk produced per day x Number of days

We know that the cow produced 72 liters of milk in 10 days, so we can use that information to find the milk produced per day:

Milk produced per day = Total milk produced / Number of days
Milk produced per day = 72 liters / 10 days
Milk produced per day = 7.2 liters

Now we can plug this value into the formula to find out how much milk the cow would produce in 12 days:

Total milk produced in 12 days = Milk produced per day x Number of days
Total milk produced in 12 days = 7.2 liters x 12 days
Total milk produced in 12 days = 86.4 liters

            Following the previous situation with Emma and her friends building sandcastles, imagine that they had originally started with 5 sandcastles instead of 6. Each of these 5 sandcastles still uses 4 buckets of sand and each of these buckets contains 3 shovels of sand. How many shovels of sand would they have used then?

Since they built 5 sandcastles, they used a total of 5 x 12 = &lt;&lt;5 x 12=60&gt;&gt;60 shovels of sand.
