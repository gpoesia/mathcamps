            On Tuesday, a group of researchers spotted 42 sharks near an island. On Wednesday, they spotted an additional 26 sharks around the same place. On Thursday, they spotted 32 more in the nearby waters, using a different technology. How many sharks were spotted in total?

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 13B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the total number of sharks spotted on Tuesday &quot;x&quot;.

On Wednesday, the researchers spotted an additional 26 sharks, so the total number of sharks spotted on Wednesday is x + 26.

On Thursday, the researchers spotted 32 more sharks using a different technology, so the total number of sharks spotted on Thursday is x + 26 + 32.

We know that the total number of sharks spotted on Tuesday is 42, so we can set up the equation:

x + 26 + 32 = 42

Solving for x, we get:

x = 42 - 26 - 32
x = 42 - 68
x = -26

But we know that the number of sharks spotted on Tuesday was positive, so the number of sharks spotted in total must be positive. Therefore, the correct answer is:

42 + 26 + 32 = 90

The total capacity of the tank is 83 gallons.
The current amount of water in the tank is 38 gallons.

To find out how much more water the tank can hold, we need to subtract the current amount of water from the total capacity:

83 gallons - 38 gallons = 45 gallons

So, the tank can hold 45 gallons more water before it is full.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's say x trucks broke down. Then, the number of trucks left is 65 - x.

We know that the number of trucks left is 31, so we can set up the equation:

65 - x = 31

Simplifying the equation:

65 - x = 31

Subtracting x from both sides:

65 = 31 + x

Subtracting 31 from both sides:

34 = x

Therefore, 34 trucks broke down.

We know that the number of functional trucks is 55, so we can set up the equation:

65 - y = 55

Simplifying the equation:

65 - y = 55

Subtracting y from both sides:

65 = 55 + y

Subtracting 55 from both sides:

9 = y

Therefore, 9 trucks broke down.

Let x be the number of beds left in the store after the sale.

We know that 50 beds were sold during the sale, so the number of beds left is 78 - 50 = 28.

If the number of beds left was duplicated due to a manufacturing error, then the number of beds left is 28 x 2 = 56.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The initial inventory error was that the toy store originally had 28 teddy bears in stock, but it was actually only 1 teddy bear.

The first shipment contained 10 more teddy bears, so the total number of teddy bears after the first shipment is 1 + 10 = 11.

The second shipment contained 49 more teddy bears, so the total number of teddy bears after the second shipment is 11 + 49 = 50.

Therefore, the toy store has 50 teddy bears in stock now after correcting the initial inventory error and receiving all the shipments.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Originally, after selling 78 of the 100 new smartphones, Apple Inc. received an additional shipment of 41 new smartphones. But what if instead, the additional shipment contained 61 new smartphones? How many new smartphones would the store have in that case?
        </p>

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 13B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: If the additional shipment contained 61 new smartphones, then the store would have 22 + 61 = &lt;&lt;22+61=83&gt;&gt;83 new smartphones in total.
### Answer: 83</pre>
