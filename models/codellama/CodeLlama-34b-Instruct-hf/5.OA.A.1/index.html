            A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total number of packs of socks the company will have once all the socks have been packaged, we need to divide the number of socks by the number of socks in a pack.

2840 socks / 40 socks per pack = 71 packs

So, the company will have 71 packs of socks in total once all the socks have been packaged.

To find the number of packs of socks the company has now, we need to add the number of packs they currently have (93) to the number of packs they will have once all the socks have been packaged (71).

93 + 71 = 164 packs

So, the company has 164 packs of socks now.

After receiving the additional 70 packs of socks, the company has a total of 164 + 70 = 234 packs of socks.

However, they had to return 8 packs due to quality issues, so the company now has 234 - 8 = 226 packs of socks.</pre>

1. The leprechaun adds 39 gold coins to the pot, so the new total is 39.
2. The leprechaun adds another 47 gold coins to the pot, so the new total is 39 + 47 = 86.
3. While the leprechaun is distracted, a fairy takes away 8 gold coins from the pot, so the new total is 86 - 8 = 78.
4. To unlock the magical lock, we need to enhance the code by adding 48 to it only once. So, we add 48 to 78, which gives us 126.

Let's start with the faster speed of 68 mph. The train traveled for 21 hours, so the total distance traveled at this speed is:

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled at the slower speed of 28 mph. The train traveled for 21 hours, so the total distance traveled at this speed is:

Now, we need to subtract the distance traveled at the slower speed from the distance traveled at the faster speed to get the total impact on the distance traveled:

We know that the region usually receives 53 inches of rain per year, so we can write an equation based on that:

x = 53

We also know that the region received 7 inches less than the usual amount, so we can write another equation based on that:

x = 53 - 7

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. To solve for &quot;x&quot;, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

53 = 53 - 7

This simplifies to:

7 = -7

This is a contradiction, which means that our initial assumptions must be incorrect. Therefore, we cannot determine the number of inches of rain that the region received in the year in question.</pre>

Let's call the number of binoculars each store had before subtracting the defective pieces &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the total number of binoculars the company manufactured is 1462, and they distributed them equally among 43 stores. So, each store received 1462/43 = 34 binoculars.

Now, let's subtract 25 from each store's stock. This means that each store will have 34 - 25 = 9 binoculars left.

So, each store ends up with 9 binoculars.

34 + 73 = 107

Now, we can use this new rate to find the amount of magical dust the fairy will sprinkle in 52 minutes:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total number of phones produced, we need to first calculate the number of phones produced in the 33 hours and then add it to the number of phones produced in the additional 13 hours.

Let's start by calculating the number of phones produced in the 33 hours:

990 phones/22 hours = 44.5 phones/hour
44.5 phones/hour x 33 hours = 1513.5 phones

Now, let's calculate the number of phones produced in the additional 13 hours:

990 phones/22 hours = 44.5 phones/hour
44.5 phones/hour x 13 hours = 588 phones

Adding the two amounts gives us the total number of phones produced:

1513.5 phones + 588 phones = 2101.5 phones

Therefore, the total number of phones produced is 2101.5 phones.</pre>

Let's call the number of bubbles made with 1 ounce of bubble fluid &quot;x&quot;.

We know that 87 ounces is equal to 87/1 = 87 times 1 ounce.

So, the number of bubbles made with 87 ounces of bubble fluid is 3654/87 = 42 times the number of bubbles made with 1 ounce of bubble fluid.
