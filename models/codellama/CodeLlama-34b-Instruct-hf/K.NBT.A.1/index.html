        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use &quot;M&quot; to represent the number of mature dolphins and &quot;Y&quot; to represent the number of young dolphins.

We know that the total number of dolphins is 10, so we can write an equation based on that:

M + Y = 10

We also know that there are 3 mature dolphins, so we can write an equation based on that:

M = 3

Now we can substitute the value of M into the first equation:

3 + Y = 10

Subtract 3 from both sides:

Y = 7

So, the trainer has 7 young dolphins.</pre>

We also know that 3 of the bikes are racing bikes, so we can write an equation based on that:

R = 3

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can use substitution or elimination to solve for M, the number of mountain bikes.

Let's use substitution. Solving the first equation for M, we get:

M = 10 - R
M = 10 - 3
M = 7

The robot needs 10 units of energy to start and run for 1 hour. This means that the energy required for the first hour is 10 units.

The robot needs additional 'w' units of energy to keep running for another hour. This means that the energy required for the second hour is 'w' units.

The total energy required for the robot to run for 2 hours is 13 units. This means that the sum of the energy required for the first and second hours is 13 units.

We can set up an equation using this information:

10 + w = 13

To solve for 'w', we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

w = 3

Therefore, the robot needs 3 additional units of energy to run for the additional hour.</pre>

We know that Lila had 10 marshmallows in the package and shared some with her friends, so she has 10 - x marshmallows left.

We also know that she has 3 marshmallows left, so we can set up the equation:

10 - x = 3

To solve for x, we can add 7 to both sides of the equation:

10 - x + 7 = 3 + 7

This simplifies to:

10 - x = 10

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

x = 7

So, Lila shared 7 marshmallows with her friends.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that the initial bunch of grapes contains 10 fruits.

If we add 'u' more grapes to it, the total number of grapes will be 10 + u.

We know that the total number of grapes is 16, so we can set up the equation:

10 + u = 16

To solve for 'u', we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

u = 6

So, we need to add 6 more grapes to the initial bunch of 10 grapes to make it 16 grapes.</pre>

We know that the total amount of milk he has now is 12 liters, which is the sum of the milk he had before (10 liters) and the milk he collected this time (x liters).

So, we can write an equation based on this information:

10 + x = 12

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 12 - 10

x = 2

Therefore, the farmer collected 2 liters of milk this time.</pre>

We know that the stack includes 10 books from the non-fiction section, so the size of set B is 10.

We also know that the stack includes 14 books in total, so the size of set A is 14.

Using the Venn diagram, we can see that the size of the intersection of sets A and B (the books that are both in the stack and from the non-fiction section) is 10.

So, the size of the set difference A \ B (the books that are in the stack but not from the non-fiction section) is 14 - 10 = 4.

We know that John has a total of 12 beach balls, and he just purchased 10 more. So, the total number of beach balls John has now is 12 + 10 = 22.

We can set up an equation using this information:

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 22 - 10

x = 12

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's say Harris originally had x books in his backpack.

He found 7 books in his backpack, so the total number of books he has now is x + 7.

We know that the total number of books Harris has is 10, so we can set up the equation:

x + 7 = 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides:

x = 3

So, Harris originally had 3 books in his backpack.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use a mathematical equation to solve this problem. Let x be the number of people who arrived at the party.

We know that the total attendance at the party is 10, so we can write an equation based on that:

10 = 9 + x

We can simplify this equation by subtracting 9 from both sides:

1 = x

So, there is one person who arrived at the party.

            A dolphin trainer currently has 9 dolphins and later acquires some additional ones, making the total number of dolphins in his care 10. How many dolphins did the trainer acquire?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 34B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use &quot;D&quot; to represent the number of dolphins the trainer had before acquiring any additional ones.

We know that the trainer had 9 dolphins before acquiring any additional ones, so we can write an equation:

D + 0 = 9

where the 0 represents the number of dolphins the trainer had before acquiring any additional ones.

We also know that the trainer acquired some additional dolphins, making the total number of dolphins in his care 10. We can write another equation:

D + x = 10

where &quot;x&quot; represents the number of dolphins the trainer acquired.

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for &quot;D&quot; and &quot;x&quot; by using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, we can solve the first equation for &quot;D&quot;:

D = 9

Now, we can substitute the value of &quot;D&quot; into the second equation:

9 + x = 10

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:

x = 1

So, the trainer acquired 1 dolphin.</pre>

* The butterfly starts her day with 6 flowers.
* She needs to visit more flowers in the afternoon to get her total daily quota of 10 flowers.

To find out how many more flowers the butterfly needs to visit in the afternoon, we can subtract the number of flowers she already has (6) from the total number of flowers she needs (10). This gives us:

10 - 6 = 4

So, the butterfly needs to visit 4 more flowers in the afternoon to get her total daily quota of 10 flowers.</pre>
