We can write this as:

where x is the number of jewels the princess had before her subject found more jewels and y is the number of jewels her subject found.

We also know that the princess had 14 jewels before her subject found more jewels, so we can substitute x = 14 into the equation:

We know that the number of trees remaining after the storm is 12, so we can set up the equation:

83 - T = 12

To solve for T, we can add T to both sides of the equation:

83 = 12 + T

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us:

We also know that after selling some of them, there are only 11 left.

So, we can set up the following equation:

To solve for x, we can add 11 to both sides of the equation:

Initially, there are 38 tents set up, which we can represent as a circle with 38 dots inside it.

Afterwards, they realize that they have 99 tents in total now. We can represent this as a circle with 99 dots inside it.

To find out how many more tents were put up after the initial setup, we can compare the two circles. We can see that the second circle has 61 more dots than the first circle.

So, 61 tents were put up after the initial setup.

We also know that 7 of the doors are yet to be installed, so we can write another equation based on that:

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations by substituting the value of U from the second equation into the first equation:

We also know that the union of A and B (denoted as A âˆª B) contains 16 keys, which is the total number of keys that Paul has.

When 8 beds were removed for repair, there were x - 8 beds left.

Since there were still 72 beds left, we can set up the equation:

To solve for x, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation:

x = 72 + 8

x = 80

Since the teacher used 60 stickers for rewarding her students in class, and now she has only 2 sheets left, we can set up another proportion to represent this information:

Now, we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'a' by using the first equation to eliminate one of the variables. Let's use the second equation to eliminate 'a':

            The zoo started the day with some number of animals, which we'll call s. During the day, 24 animals were moved to a separate area of the zoo for cleaning and care.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that 24 animals were moved to a separate area of the zoo for cleaning and care. This means that the number of animals in the main section of the zoo decreased by 24.

We know that there were 75 animals visible to visitors in the main section of the zoo after the cleaning and care process. So, the number of animals in the main section of the zoo before the cleaning and care process would have been 75 + 24 = 99 animals.

Since 24 animals were moved to a separate area of the zoo for cleaning and care, the total number of animals at the zoo at the start of the day would have been 99 + 24 = 123 animals.

Therefore, the answer is 123 animals.</pre>

We know that the total number of animals in the zoo is 99.

We also know that 18 animals were left in the zoo after the transfer.

So, we can write an equation based on this information:

99 - Z = 18

To solve for Z, we can add Z to both sides of the equation:

99 = 18 + Z

Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us:

81 = Z

Therefore, 81 animals were transferred to the other zoo.</pre>

Let's say the number of pens on Sam's desk before he brought the extra pens is x.

Then, the total number of pens on Sam's desk after he brought the extra pens is x + 26.

We know that the total number of pens on Sam's desk is 58. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 26 = 58

To solve for x, we can subtract 26 from both sides of the equation:

x = 58 - 26

We want to find |M|, which is the number of pairs of ice skates for men.

Using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, we can write:

Initially, G = 6

After some years, the population of giraffes increased and the total count is now 99.

So, we can write an equation:

G + x = 99

where x is the number of new giraffes added to the group.

We know that G = 6, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

6 + x = 99

To find the value of x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 93

So, 93 new giraffes have been added to the group.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use a equation to solve this problem.

Let x be the number of building blocks that Jenny used.

We know that the total number of building blocks that Jenny has is 85.

We also know that the number of building blocks that Jenny has left on her play mat is 14.

So, we can write an equation:

85 - x = 14

To solve for x, we can add 14 to both sides of the equation:

85 - x + 14 = 14 + 14

This simplifies to:

85 - x = 28

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 85 from both sides of the equation:

-x = 28 - 85

This simplifies to:

x = 57

So, Jenny used 57 building blocks.</pre>

So, if x is the number of students who are still seated, then the number of students on the bus initially was 17 + x.

We know that the total number of students on the bus initially was 56, which is the sum of the number of students who are still seated and the number of students who have alighted. So, we can set up the equation:

17 + x + 17 = 56

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 34 = 56

Subtracting 34 from both sides:

2x = 22

Dividing both sides by 2:

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

37 = 20 + x

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:

17 = x

So, there were 17 butterflies that left the park.</pre>

At the beginning of the school year, Jim has 68 pencils.

If he uses x pencils throughout the year, then he will have 68 - x pencils left at the end of the year.

According to the problem, Jim has 13 pencils left at the end of the year. So, we can set up the equation:

68 - x = 13

To solve for x, we can add 68 to both sides of the equation:

68 - x + 68 = 13 + 68

This simplifies to:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use a number line to represent the situation:

| 63 |

The farmer sells some of the milk, leaving him with 27 gallons. We can represent this on the number line as follows:

| 63 | - x | 27 |

We know that the total amount of milk the farmer had was 63 gallons, and he is left with 27 gallons after the sale. This means that he sold x gallons of milk.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

63 - x = 27

To solve for x, we can add 36 to both sides of the equation:

63 - x + 36 = 27 + 36

This simplifies to:

36 = 63

This equation is true, so we can conclude that the farmer sold 36 gallons of milk.

Therefore, the answer is 36 gallons.</pre>
