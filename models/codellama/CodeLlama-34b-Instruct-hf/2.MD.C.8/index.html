        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Alex has 21 dollar bills and uses 19 dollar bills to buy a toy robot.

21 - 19 = &lt;&lt;21-19=2&gt;&gt;2

Alex has 2 dollar bills left after buying the toy robot.

After his birthday party, he received 68 more dollar bills from his relatives.

2 + 68 = &lt;&lt;2+68=70&gt;&gt;70

Alex has 70 dollar bills in total now.

He spends 59 dollars on the video game, so he has 93 - 59 = &lt;&lt;93-59=34&gt;&gt;34 dollars left.
His friend borrows some money from him and gives back 13 dollars, so Shay has 34 + 13 = &lt;&lt;34+13=47&gt;&gt;47 dollars left.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Tom had 63 quarters saved up and he spent 50 quarters to buy a toy car.

To find out how many quarters Tom was left with after buying the toy car, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he had:

63 - 50 = &lt;&lt;63-50=13&gt;&gt;13

So, Tom was left with 13 quarters after buying the toy car.

            Tom had 63 quarters saved up. He decided to use some of his savings to buy a toy car that cost 50 quarters, leaving him with some change. Later, he wanted to buy a toy spaceship which cost 77 quarters. Since he had spent some quarters on the toy car, he wondered how many more quarters he would need to buy the toy spaceship. Can you help him figure this out?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can help Tom figure out how many more quarters he needs to buy the toy spaceship.

First, let's find out how much change Tom had after buying the toy car:

63 - 50 = &lt;&lt;63-50=13&gt;&gt;13

So, Tom had 13 quarters left after buying the toy car.

Now, let's find out how many more quarters Tom needs to buy the toy spaceship:

77 - 13 = &lt;&lt;77-13=64&gt;&gt;64

So, Tom needs 64 more quarters to buy the toy spaceship.

            In our last session, Tom had 63 quarters saved up and he spent them on a toy car that cost 50 quarters. But now let's suppose that the toy car only cost 7 quarters. How many quarters would Tom have left if he spent 7 quarters from his initial saving of 63 quarters on the toy car?
