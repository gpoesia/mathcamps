Since we know that a = 44m and b = 17m, we can substitute these values into the formula:

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 34B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's call the length of the shorter side &quot;x&quot; meters. Since the longer side is four times the length of the shorter side, the longer side is 4x meters.

The area of the rectangle is found by multiplying the length and width:

Area = length x width
= (4x) x 10
= 40x

Since the longer side measures 39 meters, we can set up the equation:

40x = 39x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 39/4
= 9.75

So the shorter side of the rectangle is 9.75 meters long.

Now, we can find the area of the rectangle:

Area = length x width
= (4x) x 10
= 40x
= 40(9.75)
= 388.75 square meters

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 388.75 square meters.

Let's call the length of one side &quot;x&quot;. Then, the length of the other side is also &quot;x&quot;.

The perimeter of the garden is the sum of the lengths of all its sides, which is:

Perimeter = 4x

Since we know that one side of the garden measures 21 feet, we can set up the equation:

21 = x

Now, we can find the value of &quot;x&quot; by solving the equation:

x = 21

Now, we can find the perimeter of the garden by substituting the value of &quot;x&quot; into the equation:

Perimeter = 4x = 4(21) = 84

Therefore, the perimeter of the garden is 84 feet.
