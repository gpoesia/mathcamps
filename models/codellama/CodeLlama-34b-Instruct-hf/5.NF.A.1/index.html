Emily added 41/77 of another cake to it, which means she added 41/77 of the total cake.

To find the total amount of cake, we need to add the fractions:
71/41 + 41/77 = 112/298

Therefore, there is a total of 112/298 of cake.

Now, we need to simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the denominator.

GCD(103, 128) = 1

So, the simplified fraction is:

128/103 + 95/62 = 223/103 + 95/62 = 318/103

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To add (64 / 34) + (3 / 24), we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 34 and 24, which is 252.

So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

(3 / 24) = (3 × 34) / (24 × 34) = 102 / 72

Now, we can add the fractions:

To add the result to (41 / 96), we need to find the LCD of 156 and 96, which is 144.

Subtracting 0.42 from 9.888 gives us:

1. 90/81 + 2/66 = &lt;&lt;90/81+2/66=11/27&gt;&gt;11/27

Explanation:

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. In this case, the LCM of 81 and 66 is 81 \* 66 = 5356.

So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

90/81 = 90 \* 66 / 5356 = &lt;&lt;90\*66/5356=11/27&gt;&gt;11/27
2/66 = 2 \* 81 / 5356 = &lt;&lt;2\*81/5356=11/27&gt;&gt;11/27

Therefore, the sum of the two fractions is 11/27.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To compute ((75 / 66) + (81 / 61)), we need to first simplify each fraction and then add them together.

75 / 66 = 15 / 11

Next, we simplify (81 / 61) by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the GCD of 81 and 61, which is 7.

81 / 61 = 11 / 8

Now we add the simplified fractions:

15 / 11 + 11 / 8 = 26 / 8

Therefore, ((75 / 66) + (81 / 61)) = 26 / 8.</pre>

So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1098:

51/61 = 51 x 18 / 1098 = 918 / 1098

Now, we can add the fractions:

Therefore, the sum of 95/18 and 51/61 is 6753/1098.

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, which is 3:

(51 / 84) = (51 × 840) / (84 × 840) = 429 / 7360

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To add 34/1 to 53/4, we need to first find the least common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions. The LCD is the smallest number that both numbers can divide into.

In this case, the LCD of 34/1 and 53/4 is 210.

So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

34/1 = 210/210
53/4 = 210/44

Now we can add the fractions:

210/210 + 210/44 = 420/44

The result is a mixed number: 420/44 = 10 3/4.</pre>

        What is the sum of 3/36 and 97/96? Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

3/36 = 1/12
97/96 = 97/96

Adding the two fractions:
1/12 + 97/96 = 98/112

Simplifying the fraction:
98/112 = 49/56

Therefore, the sum of 3/36 and 97/96 is 49/56.

        If the value of a variable 'v' is 69/47, what is the value of 'd' if 'd' equals 88/72 + 'v'? Please write your answer as a fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  If the value of 'v' is 69/47, then we can write:

v = 69/47

We are given that 'd' equals 88/72 + 'v', so we can write:

d = 88/72 + v

Substituting the value of 'v' from above, we get:

d = 88/72 + 69/47

Simplifying, we get:

d = 157/288

Therefore, the value of 'd' is 157/288.</pre>
