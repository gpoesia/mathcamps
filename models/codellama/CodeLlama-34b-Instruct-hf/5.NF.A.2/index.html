* The logs burn for 1/16 of an hour each, so the total burn time for the logs is 4 x 1/16 = &lt;&lt;4*1/16=1/4&gt;&gt;1/4 hour.
* The twigs burn for 1/12 of an hour each, so the total burn time for the twigs is 16 x 1/12 = &lt;&lt;16*1/12=1/2&gt;&gt;1/2 hour.

The amount used for the base is 12/16 ounces, which can be simplified to 3/4 ounce.

The amount used for the rest of the ring is 16/2 ounces, which can be simplified to 8 ounces.

In the second scenario, there are 8 fish distributed among 10 small pools, so each pool has 8/10 = 0.8 fish.

To find the total number of animals in each pond and pool combined, we need to add the number of ducks and fish in each pond and pool.

For the first pond, there are 2 ducks and 0.8 fish, so the total number of animals in the first pond is 2 + 0.8 = 2.8.

For the second pond, there are 2 ducks and 0.8 fish, so the total number of animals in the second pond is 2 + 0.8 = 2.8.

For the third pond, there are 2 ducks and 0.8 fish, so the total number of animals in the third pond is 2 + 0.8 = 2.8.

For the fourth pond, there are 2 ducks and 0.8 fish, so the total number of animals in the fourth pond is 2 + 0.8 = 2.8.

For the fifth pond, there are 2 ducks and 0.8 fish, so the total number of animals in the fifth pond is 2 + 0.8 = 2.8.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total number of pounds of food given to the monkeys and giraffes, we need to add the number of pounds of food given to each group.

For the monkeys, Mary gave 6/20 pounds of food, which is the same as 3/10 pounds.

For the giraffes, Mary gave 18/15 pounds of food, which is the same as 12/5 pounds.

Therefore, the total number of pounds of food given to the monkeys and giraffes is:
3/10 + 12/5 = 15/10 = 1 1/2 pounds.

So, Mary has given 1 1/2 pounds of food to the monkeys and giraffes.</pre>

For the liner, Johnathan needs 8/5 yards of fabric. To simplify this fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5:

Max rode his scooter for 9/7 miles in the morning, so we can write:

M = 9/7

Max rode 1/9 miles less in the afternoon, so we can write:

M - 1/9 = x

where x is the number of miles Max rode his scooter in the afternoon.

We can substitute the expression for M in terms of 9 and 7 into the equation:

(9/7) - 1/9 = x

Simplifying the equation:

9/7 - 1/9 = x

Combine like fractions:

Let's first convert the fraction of hours to decimals:

9/8 = 1.125 hours (rounded to two decimal places)
2/10 = 0.2 hours (rounded to one decimal place)

Now, let's add the two times:

1.125 + 0.2 = 1.325 hours

            Lucy has a sleeping bag that is 18/19 meter long. She got an extension for her sleeping bag which made it 8/11 meter longer. What's the total length of the sleeping bag now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Lucy's sleeping bag was originally 18/19 meters long. She got an extension that made it 8/11 meters longer. To find the total length of the sleeping bag now, we need to add the original length to the length of the extension.

18/19 + 8/11 = &lt;&lt;18/19+8/11=26/20&gt;&gt;26/20 meters.

Therefore, the total length of the sleeping bag now is 26/20 meters.

Alpha shines 17/3 times brighter than an average star, so its relative brightness is 17/3 = 5.67 times brighter.

Bravo shines 20/16 times as bright as an average star, so its relative brightness is 20/16 = 1.25 times brighter.

Adding the relative brightness of both stars gives us a total relative brightness of 5.67 + 1.25 = 6.92 times brighter than an average star.

            A colonial fireplace burns firewood at a rate of 4/15 cords per hour in the early morning. In the late night, the rate increases to 14/15 cords per hour. How much firewood does the fireplace burn in total in one hour split between the early morning and late night?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total amount of firewood burned in one hour, we need to find the average rate of burning firewood over the course of the hour.

The average rate of burning firewood can be found by adding the early morning and late night rates and dividing by 2:

(4/15 + 14/15) / 2 = 10/15 cords per hour

So, the fireplace burns 10/15 cord of firewood in total in one hour split between the early morning and late night.

### Answer: 10/15 cord</pre>

            An alien travelled 9/20 of a light year towards earth then decided to move forward another 11/7 light years. How many light years has the alien travelled in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The alien traveled 9/20 of a light year towards Earth, which is equivalent to 9/20 \* 1 = &lt;&lt;9/20\*1=4.5&gt;&gt;4.5 light years.
Then, the alien moved forward another 11/7 light years, which is equivalent to 11/7 \* 1 = &lt;&lt;11/7\*1=1.57&gt;&gt;1.57 light years.
Therefore, the alien has traveled a total of 4.5 + 1.57 = &lt;&lt;4.5+1.57=6.07&gt;&gt;6.07 light years.
### Answer: 6.07 light years.</pre>

            If Bob has 10/2 of a cucumber and he adds it to 1/7 of another cucumber, how many cucumbers does he have in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total number of cucumbers Bob has, we need to add the 10/2 of a cucumber he has to the 1/7 of another cucumber.

10/2 = 5
1/7 = 0.14

Adding these two fractions gives us:
5 + 0.14 = 5.14

So Bob has 5.14 cucumbers in total.</pre>
