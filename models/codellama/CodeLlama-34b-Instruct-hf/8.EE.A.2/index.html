Since the volume of the cuboid is given as 64 km^3, we can use the formula V = s \* l \* w, where s is the surface area of the cuboid and l and w are the lengths of the cuboid.

Since all sides of the cuboid are of equal length, we can say that the surface area of the cuboid is 6 \* x^2, since each side has area x^2.

So, we can set up the equation:

6 \* x^2 \* x = 64

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the length of one side of the cube, we need to first find the total number of blocks on each side. Since the baby is building a cube structure, each side of the cube will have the same number of blocks.

Let's call the number of blocks on each side &quot;x&quot;. Then, the total number of blocks on all sides of the cube will be 4x.

We know that the total number of blocks is 343, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 343

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 343 / 4

x = 85.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a block, we round up to the nearest whole number:

x = 86

So, the length of one side of the cube is 86 blocks.</pre>

where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

We know that the volume of the bracelet is 1000 cubic millimeters, so we can set up an equation using this information:

1000 = lwh

We also know that the bracelet is a cube, so the length, width, and height are all equal. Let's call the length of one edge &quot;x&quot; millimeters. Then we can write:

l = w = h = x

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

1000 = x^3

To solve for x, we can take the cube root of both sides:

x = 10^3

So the length of each edge of the bracelet is 10 millimeters.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the length of one side of the building &quot;x&quot; meters.

Since the building has a uniform cross-sectional area all along its height, we can assume that the cross-sectional area of the building is equal to the area of a square with side length &quot;x&quot;.

The volume of the building is given as 216 cubic meters. We can calculate the volume of a rectangular prism with dimensions &quot;x&quot; meters by &quot;x&quot; meters by &quot;x&quot; meters as follows:

Volume = Length x Width x Height
= x x x x x
= x^3

Since the volume of the building is 216 cubic meters, we can set up the equation:

x^3 = 216

To solve for &quot;x&quot;, we can take the cube root of both sides of the equation:

x = 3^3
= 27

Therefore, the length of one side of the building is 27 meters.</pre>

1000 = l^2

Now, we can take the square root of both sides of the equation to find the length of one side of the slide:

l = sqrt(1000)
l = 31.62 feet

Therefore, the length of one side of the slide is 31.62 feet.</pre>

Since each side of the cube has the same number of grapes, we can use the formula:

In this case, the total number of grapes in the container is 27, and the number of sides of the cube is 6.

So, we can plug these values into the formula:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the length of each side of the smaller ice cube &quot;x&quot;.

Since the volume of the larger cube is 729 cubic cm, we can find the total number of smaller cubes by dividing the volume of the larger cube by the volume of one smaller cube.

The volume of one smaller cube is x^3, since each side has length x.

So, the total number of smaller cubes is 729 / x^3.

We know that the larger cube is a perfect cube, so it has the same length on each side. Let's call the length of one side of the larger cube &quot;y&quot;.

Since the larger cube is made up of smaller cubes, we can find the total volume of the larger cube by multiplying the volume of one smaller cube by the number of smaller cubes.

The volume of the larger cube is y^3 = (x^3) \* (729 / x^3) = 729.

Now we have two equations:

x^3 = 729 / x^3
y^3 = 729

We can solve the first equation for x:

x^3 = 729 / x^3
x^3 \* x^3 = 729
x^6 = 729
x = 24

Now we can find y:

y^3 = 729
y = 24

So, the length of each side of the smaller ice cube is 24 cm, and the length of each side of the larger cube is also 24 cm.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. The total number of flowers used was 125.
2. The flowers were arranged in a cube shape.

Now, let's think about the problem:

* A cube has six faces, and each face has a length equal to the length of the other faces.
* Since the flowers are arranged in a cube shape, we can assume that each face of the cube has 25 flowers.
* The length of each side of the flower cube is equal to the number of flowers on each face.

So, the length of each side of the flower cube is 25.

We know that the temperature at the heart of the object is directly proportional to the cube of its length, so we can write:

T = k(x^3)

where T is the temperature in degrees Celsius and k is a constant.

We are also given that the temperature at the heart of the object is 729 degrees Celsius. So, we can set up the equation:

729 = k(x^3)

Now, we need to find the value of x. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by k:

729/k = x^3

Now, we can take the cube root of both sides of the equation:

(729/k)^(1/3) = x

So, the length of the object in units is (729/k)^(1/3).

We are not given the value of k, so we cannot find the exact length of the object. However, we can find the length of the object in terms of k.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the length of each edge of the candy package, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

V = lwh

where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

We know that the volume of the candy package is 512 cubic centimeters, so we can set up an equation using this information:

512 = lwh

We also know that the package is a cube, so the length, width, and height are all equal. Let's call the length of one edge &quot;x&quot;. Then we can write:

512 = x^3

To solve for x, we can take the cube root of both sides:

x = 512^(1/3)

x â‰ˆ 6.48

So the length of each edge of the candy package is approximately 6.48 centimeters.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the length of the edge of the cube &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the total number of eggs laid is 27, and that the eggs are arranged in a cubical shape, so the number of eggs on each face of the cube is the same.

Therefore, the number of eggs on each face of the cube is x^2.

Since there are 6 faces to the cube, the total number of eggs is 6x^2.

We are given that the total number of eggs is 27, so we can set up the equation:

6x^2 = 27

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 6:

x^2 = 27/6

x^2 = 4

x = sqrt(4)

x = 2

Therefore, the length of the edge of the cube is 2.</pre>

            A grocer has a cubic box that perfectly fits 343 grapes in it. What is the length of the side of the box marked in grapes?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the length of the side of the box marked in grapes, we need to divide the total volume of the box by the volume of a single grape.

Let's assume that the grape is a perfect cube, so its volume is equal to the volume of the box. The volume of a single grape is then:

Volume of a grape = Length of a side of the grape^3

Since the box is a perfect cube, the length of the side of the box is equal to the length of the side of a grape. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Length of a side of the box = Length of a side of a grape

We know that the volume of the box is 343 grapes, so we can set up the following equation:

Volume of the box = Number of grapes x Volume of a grape

Volume of the box = 343 x Volume of a grape

We can solve for the volume of a grape by dividing both sides of the equation by 343:

Volume of a grape = Volume of the box / Number of grapes

Volume of a grape = 343 / 343

Volume of a grape = 1

Therefore, the length of the side of the box marked in grapes is 1.</pre>

            A guitarist uses a particular type of guitar string. The thickness of the string, in hundreds of a millimeter, cubed, will determine the pitch of a certain note, the guitarist wishes to play. If he needs the pitch to equal 343 Hz, what is the thickness of the string he should choose?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To determine the thickness of the string needed to produce a pitch of 343 Hz, we can use the formula:

f = (440/2^n) / (d/1000)

where f is the frequency of the note, n is the number of half-steps above the base note (A), d is the thickness of the string in millimeters, and 440 is the frequency of the base note A.

We know that the guitarist wants to play a note with a frequency of 343 Hz, so we can set up the equation:

343 = (440/2^n) / (d/1000)

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 1000 to get:

343000 = (440/2^n) / d

Now, we can solve for d by dividing both sides by 343000:

d = (440/2^n) / 343000

We know that the guitarist wants to play a note with a frequency of 343 Hz, so we can set n = 3.

Substituting n = 3 into the equation above, we get:

d = (440/2^3) / 343000

d = 1.067 mm

Therefore, the thickness of the string needed to produce a pitch of 343 Hz is approximately 1.067 millimeters.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the length of one edge of the cubical compass box, we need to find the cube root of the cubic area.

The formula for the cube root of a number is:

cube root(x) = x^(1/3)

So, to find the length of one edge of the cubical compass box, we can use the formula:

edge length = cube root(729)

edge length = 729^(1/3)

edge length = 9

Therefore, the length of one edge of the cubical compass box is 9 cm.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the side length of each page, we need to find the length of one side of the cube. We can do this by taking the cube root of the volume of one page.

The volume of one page is 64 cubic inches, so we can find the side length of one side by taking the cube root of 64:

side length = cube root(64)

The cube root of 64 is 4, so the side length of each page is 4 inches.</pre>
