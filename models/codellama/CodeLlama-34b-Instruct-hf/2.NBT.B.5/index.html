        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of pillows Sarah sold.

We know that Sarah initially had 51 pillows and she sold some of them. So, the number of pillows she has left is 51 - x.

We also know that she's left with 2 pillows, so we can set up the equation:

51 - x = 2

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

51 = 2 + x

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

49 = x

So, Sarah sold 49 pillows.

            Previously, on Tuesday and Wednesday, a group of researchers spotted a total of 68 sharks near an island, and on Thursday, they spotted 32 more in the nearby waters. 

But now suppose that on Thursday, instead of spotting 32 more sharks, they had only spotted 15 more. How many sharks would they have reported then?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

* On Tuesday and Wednesday, the researchers spotted a total of 68 sharks.
* On Thursday, they spotted 15 more sharks, for a total of 68 + 15 = 83 sharks.

Therefore, if they had only spotted 15 more sharks on Thursday, they would have reported a total of 83 sharks.

We know that |A| = 86 and |B| = 34.

We want to find |A \ B|, which represents the set of helicopters that are left in the inventory.

Using the formula for the difference of two sets, we can write:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the distance Peter has left to travel to reach the treasure, we need to subtract the distance he has already traveled from the distance stated in the treasure map.

Let's use a number line to represent the distance:

| 0 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 |

The starting point is 74 miles from the treasure, so we can mark that on the number line:

| 0 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 |

Peter has traveled 70 miles so far, so we can mark that on the number line as well:

| 0 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 | 80 |

Now, we need to find the distance Peter has left to travel to reach the treasure. We can do this by subtracting the distance Peter has already traveled from the distance stated in the treasure map:

74 - 70 = 4

So, Peter has 4 miles left to travel to reach the treasure.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's start by converting the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin.

13Â°C = 286 K
45Â°C = 318 K

Now, let's add the two temperatures:

286 K + 318 K = 604 K

So, the final temperature inside the tent after using the heater is 604 K.

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 34B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* The store has a stock of 78 king size beds.
* They managed to sell 50 of these beds during the big sale.
* The number of beds left was duplicated due to a manufacturing error.

Now, let's think about what this means. If the number of beds left was duplicated, that means that the number of beds left is now twice the number of beds left before the sale. In other words, if there were x beds left before the sale, then there are now 2x beds left after the sale.

We know that 50 beds were sold during the sale, so we can set up the following equation:

78 - 50 = 2x

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 78 - 50
2x = 28
x = 14

So, there were 14 beds left in the store before the sale. Since the number of beds left was duplicated, there are now 2(14) = 28 beds left in the store.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 28.</pre>

3. She wants to make a second bracelet with a different design, and this one uses 36 beads.
4. Since she used some beads to make the first bracelet, she has less than 36 beads left.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many beads Sarah needs to buy to finish the second bracelet. We know that she has 56 beads in total, and she used 37 beads to make the first bracelet. That means she has 56 - 37 = 19 beads left.

We also know that the second bracelet needs 36 beads, and since Sarah has less than 36 beads left, she needs to buy some more beads to finish the bracelet. So, we can set up the following equation:

19 + x = 36

where x is the number of beads Sarah needs to buy.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 36 - 19 = 17

So, Sarah needs to buy 17 beads to finish the second bracelet.</pre>

To solve for x, we can add 78 to both sides of the equation:

88 - x + 78 = 78 + x

This simplifies to:

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use a mathematical equation to solve this problem. Let x be the number of shirts the store sold that day.

We know that the store had 48 shirts in stock at the beginning of the day, and after the day of sales, they had 26 shirts remaining. This means that the store sold 48 - 26 = &lt;&lt;48-26=22&gt;&gt;22 shirts that day.

So, the answer to the problem is 22 shirts.
