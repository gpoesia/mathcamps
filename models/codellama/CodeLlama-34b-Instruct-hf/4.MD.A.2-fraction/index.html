        Steve started with 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days. Then he received an extra 11 dollars. John started with 18 dollars but then he spent the same amount of money as Steve had. John found 25 dollars on the street. How much money does John have now?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Steve started with $38 and spent it evenly over 8 days, so he spent $38 / 8 = $4.75 per day.

John started with $18 and spent the same amount of money as Steve had, so he spent $4.75 per day as well.

After 8 days, Steve had $38 - (8 x $4.75) = $38 - $37.75 = $0.25 left.

John found $25 on the street, so he now has $18 + $25 = $43.

Therefore, John has $43 - $0.25 = $42.75 left.</pre>

        Sally wants to measure the distance of her bike route. Initially, she hesitates and travels only 47/50 of a mile. Then, she gains confidence and rides another 31 miles. Every day for the next 28 days, she completes the same distance.

One day, she decided to detour and added an extra 32/24 miles to her regular bike route. How many miles in total did she travel after adding the extra traveling distance?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total distance traveled by Sally, we need to add the initial distance, the distance traveled every day for 28 days, and the extra distance traveled on the detour.

Initial distance: 47/50 mile = 0.94 mile
Distance traveled every day for 28 days: 31 miles
Extra distance traveled on the detour: 32/24 miles = 1.33 miles

Total distance traveled = 0.94 + 31 + 1.33 = 33.27 miles

        A truck can travel a distance of 34/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel. If 11 more kilometers are added to its journey, what is the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel? Then, if an additional 49 kilometers are added to the journey, what would be the total distance then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel, we need to first find the fuel efficiency in liters per kilometer. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the fuel consumed:

Fuel efficiency = distance traveled / fuel consumed
= 34/25 kilometers / 1 liter
= 1.36 liters per kilometer

Now, to find the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel, we can multiply the fuel efficiency by the total fuel available:

Total distance = fuel efficiency x total fuel
= 1.36 liters per kilometer x 1 liter
= 1.36 kilometers

So, the truck can travel 1.36 kilometers before running out of fuel.

If 11 more kilometers are added to the journey, the total distance traveled becomes:

Total distance = 1.36 kilometers + 11 kilometers
= 14.6 kilometers

If an additional 49 kilometers are added to the journey, the total distance traveled becomes:

Total distance = 14.6 kilometers + 49 kilometers
= 63.6 kilometers

Therefore, the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel is 63.6 kilometers.</pre>

        John drank a special energy drink that increased his jogging speed. After the energy drink, he was able to jog 50/49 miles per hour faster. One day, he had a speed of 4/22 miles per hour without the use of the energy drink. After consuming the energy drink, at what rate would he jog if he continued for 46/30 hours?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's first calculate the rate at which John jogged without the energy drink:

4/22 miles per hour = 4/22 \* 60 minutes/hour = 8/110 minutes per minute

Now, let's calculate the rate at which John jogged with the energy drink:

50/49 miles per hour = 50/49 \* 60 minutes/hour = 100/99 minutes per minute

So, the energy drink increased John's jogging speed by 100/99 - 8/110 = 92/110 minutes per minute.

Now, let's calculate the rate at which John would jog for 46/30 hours:

92/110 minutes per minute \* 46/30 hours = 132/33 minutes per hour

So, John would jog at a rate of 132/33 miles per hour for 46/30 hours.</pre>

        A truck driver starts his route with 9 gallons of gas in his tank. He stops at a station and adds to this tank another 21/36 gallons of gas. Later, he stops at another station and adds another 26/42 gallons of gas. How many gallons of gas total does the truck driver have now in his tank?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The truck driver starts with 9 gallons of gas.
He adds 21/36 gallons of gas, which is the same as adding 7/12 gallons of gas.
So, the total amount of gas in the tank now is 9 + 7/12 = 9 + 1/4 = &lt;&lt;9+1/4=13/4&gt;&gt;13/4 gallons.
He then adds 26/42 gallons of gas, which is the same as adding 13/21 gallons of gas.
So, the total amount of gas in the tank now is 13/4 + 13/21 = &lt;&lt;13/4+13/21=26/7&gt;&gt;26/7 gallons.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how much Sophia spends each day for her fuel, we need to divide the amount she spends every 28 days by the number of days in that period.

Let's use the formula:

Daily cost = Total cost / Number of days

In this case, the total cost is 40 dollars, and the number of days is 28.

Daily cost = 40 / 28

Daily cost = 1.43 dollars per day

So, Sophia spends 1.43 dollars per day to fill up her car's fuel tank.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Roberto has 50 ounces of juice.
He splits the juice into 17 equal parts.
He then takes the juice from one part and pours it into a container.
He then takes 34/44 of what is in that container and pours it into another container.

Let's call the amount of juice in the first container &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the amount of juice in the second container is 34/44 of &quot;x&quot;.

We also know that the total amount of juice in the two containers is 50 ounces.

So, we can set up the following equation:

x + (34/44)x = 50

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 34/44x = 50

Combine like terms:

3x/2 = 50

Multiply both sides by 2:

3x = 100

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 33 1/3

So, there are 33 1/3 ounces of juice in the second container.</pre>

John saves 20/48 of the money he needs every week, so he saves 20/48 of 11 dollars every week.

After a certain period of time, John decides to put all his savings so far into an investment account. The account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested after a year.

John has saved 20/48 of 11 dollars every week, so he has saved a total of 20/48 of 11 dollars times the number of weeks he has saved.

Let x be the number of weeks John has saved. Then, John has saved a total of 20/48 of 11 dollars times x.

John decides to put all his savings so far into an investment account. The account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested after a year.

John has saved a total of 20/48 of 11 dollars times x. After a year, the investment account will return 41/11 times the money invested, so John will have 41/11 times 20/48 of 11 dollars times x after a year.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total length of 20 pieces of lumber, we need to multiply the length of each piece by 20.

The length of each piece of lumber is 45/44 meters. To simplify this fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2:

45/44 = 90/88

So, the length of each piece of lumber is 90/88 meters.

To find the total length of 20 pieces of lumber, we multiply 90/88 by 20:

90/88 × 20 = 1800/88

Therefore, the total length of 20 pieces of lumber is 1800/88 meters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total length of 20 pieces of the newly cut lumber, we need to multiply the length of each piece by 20.

The length of each piece of lumber is 25/34 meters. To simplify this fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2:

25/34 = 50/68

So, the length of each piece of lumber is 50/68 meters.

To find the total length of 20 pieces of lumber, we multiply 50/68 by 20:

The length of each piece of lumber is 45/31 meters. To simplify this fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3:

45/31 = 135/93

So, the length of each piece of lumber is 135/93 meters.

To find the total length of 20 pieces of lumber, we multiply 135/93 by 20:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the distance covered by the sprinter in one hour from both parts together, we need to find the total distance covered by the sprinter in one hour from each part and then add them up.

Let's start with the first part:

The sprinter runs at a speed of 34 miles per 14 hours, which means they cover 34 miles in 14 hours. To find the distance covered by the sprinter in one hour, we can divide the total distance by the time taken:

34 miles / 14 hours = 2.4 miles per hour

So, the sprinter covers 2.4 miles in one hour from the first part.

Now, let's move on to the second part:

The sprinter runs at a speed of 21 miles per 26 hours, which means they cover 21 miles in 26 hours. To find the distance covered by the sprinter in one hour, we can divide the total distance by the time taken:

21 miles / 26 hours = 0.8 miles per hour

So, the sprinter covers 0.8 miles in one hour from the second part.

Now, let's add the distances covered by the sprinter from both parts:

2.4 miles + 0.8 miles = 3.2 miles

Therefore, the sprinter covers a total distance of 3.2 miles in one hour from both parts together.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the distance traveled by the car, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

In this case, the speed is 41 miles per hour, and the time is 20/11 hours. To convert the time to hours, we can multiply 20 by 11:

Time = 20 x 11 = 220 hours

Now we can plug in the values we have found into the formula:

Distance = 41 x 220 = 9020 miles

Therefore, the car traveled 9020 miles during this trip.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption, we need to first convert the weight of the apples from pounds to ounces.

17 pounds = 272 ounces (since there are 16 ounces in a pound)

Next, we can set up a ratio to represent the relationship between the weight of the apples and the amount of apple juice:

272 ounces (apples) : 48 ounces (apple juice) = 5.6 : 1

This means that for every 5.6 ounces of apples, John consumes 1 ounce of apple juice.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that Walter paid 23/21 dollars for the pen. This means that he paid 23/21 of his money for the pen.

We can write this as:

23/21 = x/100

Where x is the amount of money Walter had before buying the pen.

Now, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 100:

2300/21 = x

x = 1100

So, Walter had 1100 dollars before buying the pen.

Now, we can use the information that Walter had 46 dollars left after buying the pen. This means that he spent 1100 - 46 = 1054 dollars on the pen.

Therefore, the total amount of money that Walter had was 1100 + 1054 = 2154 dollars.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many kilograms of honey the farmer harvests in a day, we need to multiply the number of beehives by the average amount of honey harvested from each beehive.

Number of beehives = 37
Average amount of honey harvested from each beehive = 44/10 kilograms

Total amount of honey harvested in a day = Number of beehives x Average amount of honey harvested from each beehive
= 37 x 44/10
= 1594/10 kilograms

Therefore, the farmer harvests 1594/10 kilograms of honey in a day.

To find out how many kilograms of honey the farmer sells, we need to multiply the total amount of honey harvested by the percentage of honey sold.

Percentage of honey sold = 3/37
Total amount of honey harvested = 1594/10 kilograms

Amount of honey sold = Total amount of honey harvested x Percentage of honey sold
= 1594/10 x 3/37

        Jessie decides to save her money for 13 weeks. Each week, she saves an amount equal to the sum of her initial savings and the money she received from her grandma. How much money does she save in total after 13 weeks?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Jessie saves an amount equal to the sum of her initial savings and the money she received from her grandma each week.

After the first week, Jessie has saved a total of $34 + $20 = $54.

After the second week, Jessie has saved a total of $54 + ($34 + $20) = $54 + $54 = $108.

After the third week, Jessie has saved a total of $108 + ($34 + $20) = $108 + $54 = $162.

After the fourth week, Jessie has saved a total of $162 + ($34 + $20) = $162 + $54 = $216.

After the fifth week, Jessie has saved a total of $216 + ($34 + $20) = $216 + $54 = $270.

After the sixth week, Jessie has saved a total of $270 + ($34 + $20) = $270 + $54 = $324.

After the seventh week, Jessie has saved a total of $324 + ($34 + $20) = $324 + $54 = $378.

After the eighth week, Jessie has saved a total of $378 + ($34 + $20) = $378 + $54 = $432.

After the ninth week, Jessie has saved a total of $432 + ($34 + $20) = $432 + $54 = $486.

After the tenth week, Jessie has saved a total of $486 + ($34 + $20) = $486 + $54 = $540.

After the eleventh week, Jessie has saved a total of $540 + ($34 + $20) = $540 + $54 = $594.

After the twelfth week, Jessie has saved a total of $594 + ($34 + $20) = $594 + $54 = $648.

After the thirteenth week, Jessie has saved a total of $648 + ($34 + $20) = $648 + $54 = $702.

Therefore, Jessie has saved a total of $702 after 13 weeks.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how much less the new vendor charges per bag, we need to compare the cost per bag for each vendor.

The original vendor charges $34 per 8 bags, so the cost per bag is:

$34 / 8 bags = $4.25 per bag

The new vendor charges $19 per 30 bags, so the cost per bag is:

$19 / 30 bags = $0.63 per bag

To find out how much less the new vendor charges per bag, we can subtract the cost per bag of the new vendor from the cost per bag of the original vendor:

$4.25 - $0.63 = $3.62

So, the new vendor charges $3.62 less per bag than the original vendor.</pre>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how much Lisa spends per day, we need to divide the total amount she spends by the number of days she spends it over.

Let's use the information we know to set up an equation:

Lisa spends $50 for over 46 days.

We can write this as:

$50 / 46 days = x

Where x is the amount Lisa spends per day.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 46:

$50 / 46 = x

Now, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 50:

1/46 = x

Now, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 1:

x = 1/46

So, Lisa spends $1 per day.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Oscar has $33 saved up.

He decides to spend 13/41 of his money on a new video game.

To find out how much money he spends on the video game, we need to multiply the amount he spends by the number of dollars he has.

13/41 = 0.317

0.317 x $33 = $10.51

So, Oscar spends $10.51 on the video game.</pre>

        A turtle travels at a speed of 19/6 feet per second. How far, in feet, would the turtle travel in 24 seconds if it starts 20 feet ahead from the starting point?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

We are given that the turtle travels at a speed of 19/6 feet per second, and we want to know how far it will travel in 24 seconds.

First, we need to convert the speed from feet per second to feet per minute. We can do this by multiplying the speed by 60, since there are 60 seconds in a minute:

19/6 x 60 = 31.67 feet per minute

Next, we can multiply the speed in feet per minute by the time in minutes to get the distance traveled:

31.67 x 24 = 750.28 feet

Finally, we can add the starting distance of 20 feet to the distance traveled to get the total distance traveled:

750.28 + 20 = 770.28 feet

Therefore, the turtle will travel 770.28 feet in 24 seconds if it starts 20 feet ahead of the starting point.</pre>

        Carlos has a container with a capacity of 3 liters. He filled it with orange juice to just 41/49 of its capacity. How many liters of orange juice did he pour into the container?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the information given in the problem to set up an equation.

Let x be the number of liters of orange juice that Carlos poured into the container.

We know that the container has a capacity of 3 liters, so the amount of orange juice that Carlos poured into the container is 3 - x.

We also know that the amount of orange juice that Carlos poured into the container is 41/49 of the capacity of the container. This means that the amount of orange juice that Carlos poured into the container is equal to 41/49 of 3 liters, which is 3 \* 41/49 = 1.63 liters.

So, the number of liters of orange juice that Carlos poured into the container is 1.63 liters.

### Answer: 1.63 liters.</pre>

        If a train travels at the speed of 39 kilometers per hour, how far would the train cover in 5 hours?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the distance the train covers in 5 hours, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

In this case, the speed is 39 kilometers per hour, and the time is 5 hours.

Distance = 39 km/h x 5 h
Distance = 195 km

Therefore, the train covers a distance of 195 kilometers in 5 hours.</pre>

        You have $15 in your savings account. You decided to spend 17/23 of a dollar on a small sweet. How much is left in your savings account after buying the sweet?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

17/23 of a dollar is equal to 17/23 \* 100% = &lt;&lt;17/23\*100%=\frac{17}{23}\times 100%=\frac{17}{23}\times \frac{100}{100}=\frac{17}{23}\times 1=\frac{17}{23}&gt;&gt;17/23.

You spent 17/23 of a dollar on the sweet, which is equal to 17/23 \* 1 = &lt;&lt;17/23\*1=17/23&gt;&gt;17/23.

You have $15 in your savings account, and you spent 17/23 of a dollar on the sweet. Therefore, you have $15 - 17/23 = &lt;&lt;15-17/23=15-\frac{17}{23}=\frac{15\times 23}{23}-\frac{17}{23}=\frac{15\times 23-17}{23}=\frac{325-17}{23}=\frac{308}{23}&gt;&gt;308/23 left in your savings account after buying the sweet.
