            In a bag, there are total 355 balls. If there are already 44 green balls, how many red balls should be added to the bag?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* There are 355 balls in the bag.
* There are already 44 green balls in the bag.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the number of red balls that should be added to the bag. We know that the total number of balls in the bag is 355, and we know that 44 of those balls are green. That means there are 355 - 44 = 311 balls left in the bag.

If we want to add red balls to the bag, we need to find out how many red balls we need to add to make the total number of balls in the bag equal to 355. We can do this by subtracting the number of green balls from the total number of balls:

355 - 44 = 311

So, we need to add 311 - 355 = -44 red balls to the bag.

Therefore, the answer is -44 red balls.</pre>

We also know that 182 pairs are for men, so we can write an equation based on that:

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can use substitution or elimination to solve for W. Let's use substitution.

First, we can solve the equation M = 182 for M:

M = 182

Now we can substitute the value of M into the first equation:

Let's call the total amount of energy that the star radiates &quot;E&quot;. Then, we can write the equation:

E = 401

We know that 82 units of this energy are background energy, so we can write:

E - 82 = 401

Subtracting 82 from both sides gives us:

E = 401 - 82

E = 319

Therefore, the star itself radiates 319 units of energy per hour.</pre>

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 34B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that the English teacher has 271 books. We can write this as:

271 = x + y

Where x is the number of books the other teachers have, and y is the number of books the English teacher has.

We also know that the total number of books in the school is 632. So, we can write:

x + y = 632

Now, we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y by using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, we can solve the first equation for y:

y = 271 - x

Now, we can substitute this expression for y in the second equation:

x + (271 - x) = 632

Combine like terms:

2x + 271 = 632

Subtract 271 from both sides:

2x = 361

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 180

Now, we know that the English teacher has 271 books, so the other teachers have 180 books.

127 = x + 29

where x is the number of bits of eraser that came from red pencils.

We also know that the total number of bits of eraser that came from blue pencils is 29.

So, we can set up the following equation:

x + 29 = 127

To solve for x, we can subtract 29 from both sides of the equation:

x = 127 - 29

x = 98

Therefore, 98 bits of eraser came from red pencils.</pre>

We know that Angela's watch is fast by 262 minutes, so it is currently showing a time that is 262 minutes ahead of the actual time.

We also know that the watch is showing a time that is 399 minutes later than it actually is. This means that the watch is showing a time that is 399 - 262 = 137 minutes ahead of the actual time.

We know that Mary added pieces in sets of 4, so the total number of pieces she added is x / 4.

We also know that the total number of pieces, including the original count and the pieces she added, is 276. So we can set up the equation:

x + (x / 4) = 276

Simplifying the equation:

x + x/4 = 276

Combine like terms:

2x/4 = 276

Multiply both sides by 4:

2x = 1088

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 544

So the original count of pieces before Mary added the last set was 544.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the previous speed of Superhero Flash &quot;x&quot; miles per hour.

We know that the total miles he can run is increased by 19 miles per hour compared to his previous speed, so the new speed would be:

x + 19 = 198

We can solve for x by subtracting 19 from both sides:

x = 179

So, Superhero Flash's previous speed was 179 miles per hour.</pre>

Let's use the information given in the problem to set up an equation:

385 (total number of chocolate bars produced) - 230 (number of dark chocolate bars) = x (number of milk chocolate bars)

Now, we can solve for x:

385 - 230 = x

155 = x

So, there are 155 milk chocolate bars produced by the chocolate factory every day.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the cost of brand value, sales profits, and other overheads x.

We know that the total cost of the watch is $422, so the total cost of the watch is $200 (manufacturing cost) + x (cost of brand value, sales profits, and other overheads).

We can set up an equation based on this:

$422 = $200 + x

Subtracting $200 from both sides gives us:

$222 = x

So, the cost of brand value, sales profits, and other overheads is $222.</pre>
