        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the average daily weight gain of the baby, we need to divide the total weight gained by the number of days.

Total weight gained = 2125 grams
Number of days = 25 days

Average daily weight gain = Total weight gained / Number of days
= 2125 grams / 25 days
= 85 grams per day

Therefore, the average daily weight gain of the baby is 85 grams per day.</pre>

Total distance traveled = 4104 miles

To find the number of miles the tiger travels in one day, we can divide the total distance traveled by the number of days traveled:

4104 miles / 54 days = 76.6 miles per day

Therefore, the tiger travels 76.6 miles in one day.</pre>

Since there are 29 identical parts, the total number of stones in the bracelet is 29x.
We know that the total number of stones is 87, so we can set up the equation:
29x = 87
To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 29:
x = 87/29
x = 3

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many bottles of juice are in each box, we need to divide the total number of bottles by the number of boxes.

1333 bottles Ã· 43 boxes = 31 bottles per box

So, there are 31 bottles of juice in each box.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the volume of each smaller snowball, we need to divide the volume of the giant snowball by the number of smaller snowballs.

Volume of giant snowball = 528 cubic feet
Number of smaller snowballs = 16

Volume of each smaller snowball = 528 / 16 = 33 cubic feet

Therefore, the volume of each smaller snowball is 33 cubic feet.</pre>
