So, the product of (29/2) and (19/28) is 561/56, which can be simplified to 10/7.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the expression ((15 / 3) * (19 / 26)), we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Parentheses: Inside the parentheses, we have (15 / 3) and (19 / 26).
2. Exponents (none in this case).
3. Multiplication: We multiply the two fractions together.
4. Division (none in this case).

So, we have:

((15 / 3) * (19 / 26)) = (5 * 19) / (3 * 26)
= 95 / 81

To simplify this fraction, we can cancel out the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, which is 7:

95 / 81 = 13 / 17

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 13/17.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how much of the ingredient the bakery will require, we need to first find out how many servings of the recipe they will be making.

To do this, we can multiply the number of servings they want to make (30/4) by the number of servings per recipe (19/28):

30/4 x 19/28 = 15/14

So, the bakery will be making 15/14 servings of the recipe.

Next, we need to find out how much of the ingredient is required for each serving. We can do this by dividing the total amount of ingredient required (19/28) by the number of servings:

19/28 Ã· 15/14 = 19/15

So, the bakery will require 19/15 of the ingredient for each serving.

Finally, we can multiply the amount of ingredient required for each serving by the number of servings they will be making to find out how much of the ingredient they will require in total:

19/15 x 15/14 = 19/14

Therefore, the bakery will require 19/14 of the ingredient for the special order.</pre>

24/23 = 24/23 x 3/3 = 72/69

23/3 = 23/3 x 2/2 = 46/6

Now we can multiply the equivalent fractions:

For flour, we have:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the result of the operation, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate the result of the division: 12 / 14 = 0.857142857142857
2. Multiply the result by the result of the second division: 0.857142857142857 * 28 / 5 = 14.2857142857143

Therefore, the result of the operation is 14.2857142857143.

To simplify the resulting fraction to its lowest terms, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator. In this case, the GCD of 14 and 5 is 1, so we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 1:

14.2857142857143 / 1 = 14.2857142857143

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 14.2857142857143.</pre>

Then, we simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

So, to multiply (16/6) with (29/27), we first multiply the numerators:

16 x 29 = 464

Next, we multiply the denominators:

6 x 27 = 162

Now, we simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their GCD:

464 Ã· 162 = 2

Therefore, the fraction we get when we multiply (16/6) with (29/27) is 2/1.

To multiply two fractions, we need to follow the order of operations. First, we multiply the numerators (the numbers on top) and then we multiply the denominators (the numbers on the bottom).

So, in this case, we would multiply 15 by 27, which gives us 405. Then, we multiply 12 by 3, which gives us 36.

Now, we need to simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 405 and 36 is 9, so we divide both numbers by 9:

405 Ã· 9 = 45
36 Ã· 9 = 4

Therefore, the result of multiplying (15/12) by (27/3) is 45/4, which is simplified to 11/1.</pre>
