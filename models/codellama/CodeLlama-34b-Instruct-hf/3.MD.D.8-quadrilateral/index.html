        The perimeter of a rectangular swimming pool is 324 meters. The length of the pool is 83 meters. What is the width of the pool?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the width of the pool, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:

Perimeter = 2(l + w)

where l is the length and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter is 324 meters and the length is 83 meters, so we can substitute these values into the formula to get:

324 = 2(83 + w)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

324 = 166 + 2w

Subtracting 166 from both sides gives us:

158 = 2w

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

79 = w

Therefore, the width of the pool is 79 meters.</pre>

        A rectangle has a perimeter of 194 cm. The length of one of its sides is 49 cm. Can you determine the length of its other side?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can determine the length of the other side.

Let's call the length of the side that is 49 cm &quot;a&quot;. Then, the length of the other side is &quot;b&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of the rectangle is 194 cm, so we can set up the equation:

a + b + a + b = 194

Combine like terms:

2a + 2b = 194

Subtract a from both sides:

2a + b = 194 - a

Subtract b from both sides:

2a = 194 - a - b

Divide both sides by 2:

a = 97 - (a + b)/2

Now, we need to find the value of a. We can do this by substituting the value of b.

We know that the length of one side is 49 cm, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

a = 97 - (49 + b)/2

Now, we need to solve for b. We can do this by using the equation:

b = 97 - (49 + b)/2

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

b = 97 - 49 - b/2

Subtract b/2 from both sides:

b/2 = 97 - 49 - b

Subtract 49 from both sides:

b/2 = 97 - b

Subtract b from both sides:

b/2 = 97 - 2b

Multiply both sides by 2:

b = 194 - 2b

Subtract 2b from both sides:

b = 194 - 4b

Now, we can solve for b by dividing both sides by 4:

b = 194/4

b = 48

Now that we have found the value of b, we can find the value of a. We can do this by substituting the value of b into the equation:

a = 97 - (49 + 48)/2

a = 97 - 97

a = 0

Therefore, the length of the other side of the rectangle is 48 cm.</pre>

The perimeter of the garden is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. Since the shorter side has a length of 57 meters, the longer side must have a length of x - 57 meters.

        A rectangular field has a total perimeter of 200 meters. The length of the field is known to be 49 meters. What is the width of the field in meters?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:

Perimeter = 2(l + w)

where l is the length and w is the width.

We know that the perimeter of the field is 200 meters, so we can set up an equation using this information:

2(49 + w) = 200

Simplifying this equation, we get:

98 + w = 100

Subtracting 98 from both sides, we get:

w = 2

Therefore, the width of the field is 2 meters.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
Let's call the length of each side of the square &quot;x&quot;.
Then, the perimeter of the square is equal to 4x.
Given that the perimeter of the square is 268cm, we can set up the equation:
4x = 268
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:
x = 268/4
x = &lt;&lt;268/4=67&gt;&gt;67
So, the length of each side of the square is 67cm.

We know that the perimeter of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 191 units, and we know the lengths of three of the sides: 35, 76, and 5.

So, we can set up the following equation:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the length of each of the other two sides x.

We know that the total length of the fence is 166m, so we can set up the equation:

19m + 19m + 2x = 166m

Simplifying the equation:

2x = 148m

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 74m

So the length of each of the other two sides is 74m.</pre>

We know that the perimeter of a quadrilateral is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, we know that the perimeter is 246m.

We also know that two of the sides have lengths of 40m and 32m, and another side has a length of 95m. So, we can set up the following equation:

40 + 32 + 95 + x = 246

Simplifying the equation:

77 + x = 246

Subtracting 77 from both sides:

x = 169

So, the length of the fourth side is 169m.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the length of one side of the square, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a square, which is:

Given that the perimeter is 32m, we can set up the equation:

32 = 4s

To solve for s, we can divide both sides by 4:

8 = s

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can help you with that!

The perimeter of a square is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since the perimeter of this square is 12 meters, we can set up the following equation:

4s = 12

where s is the length of one side of the square.

To solve for s, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

s = 12/4

s = 3

Therefore, the length of one side of the square is 3 meters.</pre>

We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, we know that one side is 5m long, so the perimeter is equal to 5 + x + x + 5 = 98.

Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 10 = 98.

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us 2x = 88.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us x = 44.

So, the length of the other side is 44m.</pre>

        A rectangle has two sides measuring 45m each. If the total perimeter of the rectangle is 210m, what is the length of each of the other two sides?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the length of each of the other two sides x.

We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the perimeter is 210m.

So, we can set up the equation:

45 + 45 + x + x = 210

Simplifying the equation:

90 + x + x = 210

Combine like terms:

2x + 90 = 210

Subtract 90 from both sides:

2x = 120

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 60

So, the length of each of the other two sides is 60m.</pre>
