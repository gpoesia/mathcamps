            Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, we have:

40s - 91q = 37

Now, divide both sides by 40 to get:

s - 2q = 37/40

Now, add 2q to both sides to get:

s = 37/40 + 2q

Now, substitute this expression for s into the second equation:

30(37/40 + 2q) + 12q = 121

Expand and simplify:

111q + 37 = 121

Subtract 37 from both sides:

111q = 84

Divide both sides by 111:

q = 84/111

Now, substitute this value of q into the expression for s:

s = 37/40 + 2(84/111)

Simplify:

s = 37/40 + 16/111

Therefore, the values of q and s are 84/111 and 37/40 + 16/111, respectively.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, solve the first equation for b:

4 * b + 44 * m = 180

Subtracting 44m from both sides gives us:

4b = 180 - 44m

Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:

b = (180 - 44m) / 4

Now, substitute this expression for b into the second equation:

79 * m - 6 * (180 - 44m) / 4 = 48

Expanding the right-hand side gives us:

79m - 6(180 - 44m) / 4 = 48

Simplifying and rearranging gives us:

79m - 6(180 - 44m) = 4(48)

Expanding the right-hand side gives us:

79m - 6(180) + 6(44m) = 192

Simplifying and rearranging gives us:

79m - 1080 + 264m = 192

Subtracting 1080 from both sides gives us:

185m = 832

Dividing both sides by 185 gives us:

m = 4

Now that we have found m, we can substitute it into the expression for b that we found earlier:

b = (180 - 44m) / 4

Substituting m = 4 gives us:

b = (180 - 44(4)) / 4

Simplifying gives us:

b = (180 - 176) / 4

Simplifying further gives us:

b = 4

Therefore, the values of b and m are 4 and 4, respectively.</pre>

From the first equation, we have:

Now, we can solve for v and o.

First, we can solve the first equation for v:

76((21 + 6o) / 12) - 45o = 50

Expand and simplify:

166 - 31o = 50

31o = 116

o = 116 / 31

o = 3.71

Now that we have found o, we can find v:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, solve the first equation for y:

194 = 4y + 14n

Subtract 14n from both sides:

180 = 4y

Divide both sides by 4:

45 = y

Now, substitute y = 45 into the second equation:

7 = 65n - 79y

Substitute y = 45:

7 = 65n - 79(45)

Simplify:

7 = 65n - 3495

Add 3495 to both sides:

3502 = 65n

Divide both sides by 65:

53.15 = n

So, n = 53.15.

Now, substitute n = 53.15 into the first equation:

194 = 4y + 14n

Substitute n = 53.15:

194 = 4y + 14(53.15)

Simplify:

194 = 4y + 739

Subtract 739 from both sides:

120 = 4y

Divide both sides by 4:

30 = y

So, y = 30.

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is y = 30 and n = 53.15.</pre>

Now, substitute this expression for g into the second equation:

6 = 41l - 53(146 - 26l) / 28

Now simplify and solve for l:

6 = 41l - 53(146 - 26l) / 28
6 = 41l - 53(146) / 28 + 53(26l) / 28
6 = 41l - 146(53) / 28 + 53(26l) / 28
6 = 41l - 3998 + 146(26l) / 28
6 = 41l - 3998 + 692l
6 = 41l - 3306

Now, solve for l:

l = 146 / 28
l = 5

Now that we have found l, we can substitute it into the first equation to find g:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, we have:

43q - 44e = 29

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

44e - 43q = -29

Now, adding the second equation to both sides of the above equation, we get:

30q + 43e = 130 + (-29)

Simplifying, we get:

30q + 43e = 101

Now, we have a linear equation in q and e. Solving for q, we get:

q = (101 - 43e) / 30

Now, substituting this value of q in the first equation, we get:

43(101 - 43e) / 30 - 44e = 29

Simplifying, we get:

123 - 129e = 29

Adding 129e to both sides, we get:

123 = 29 + 129e

Subtracting 29 from both sides, we get:

94 = 129e

Dividing both sides by 129, we get:

e = 94 / 129

Therefore, the value of e is 94/129.

Now, substituting this value of e in the equation q = (101 - 43e) / 30, we get:

q = (101 - 43(94/129)) / 30

Simplifying, we get:

q = 101 / 30 - (43/129)

Therefore, the value of q is 3 + (43/129).</pre>

First, solve the first equation for r:

r = 53 / (89 - 74a)

Now, substitute this expression for r into the second equation:

109 = 37a + 6(53 / (89 - 74a))

Now, simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

109 = 37a + 6(53 / (89 - 74a))
109 = 37a + 6(53 / 15)
109 = 37a + 6(3)
109 = 37a + 18

Now, solve for a:

a = 109 / 37
a = 3

Now that we have found a, we can substitute it into the first equation to find r:

r = 53 / (89 - 74a)
r = 53 / (89 - 74(3))
r = 53 / 15
r = 3

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve for 'g' and 'q', we need to use the two equations given.

From the first equation, we can write:

42g + 12q = 169

From the second equation, we can write:

12q - 50g = 19

Now, we can solve for 'g' and 'q' by adding the two equations:

42g + 12q = 169
12q - 50g = 19

Adding the two equations, we get:

54g + 12q = 188

Now, we can solve for 'g' by subtracting 12q from both sides:

54g = 188 - 12q

Substituting the value of 12q from the first equation, we get:

54g = 188 - 12(42)
54g = 188 - 492
54g = -324

Dividing both sides by 54, we get:

g = -6.3

Now, we can find 'q' by substituting the value of 'g' in the first equation:

42(-6.3) + 12q = 169
-260.4 + 12q = 169
12q = 439.4
q = 36.6

Therefore, the values of 'g' and 'q' are -6.3 and 36.6, respectively.</pre>

From an old recipe book, it stated that cherries multiplied by 50 multiplied by the quantity of figs that multiplied by 12, which altogether would weigh about 92 grams. Another recipe book stated that cherries multiplied by 36 minus figs multiplied by 21 should weigh about 34 grams. Can you find the quantity of cherries (c) and figs (f)? Use the following system of equations to solve:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can first solve the first equation for c:

50c + 12f = 92
50c = 92 - 12f
50c = 80 + 12f
c = 80/50 + 12/50f
c = 1.6 + 2.4f

Now, we can substitute this expression for c into the second equation:

36(1.6 + 2.4f) - 21f = 34
57.6 + 64.8f - 21f = 34
92.4f - 21f = 34
71.4f = 68
f = 68/71.4
f = 0.96

Now we can find c:

c = 1.6 + 2.4f
c = 1.6 + 2.4(0.96)
c = 1.6 + 2.288
c = 3.888

85d - 82((7 + 75d) / 87) = 54

Now simplify and solve for d:

85d - 82(7 + 75d) / 87 = 54

85d - 82(7) / 87 - 82(75d) / 87 = 54

85d - 56 / 87 - 6175d / 87 = 54

85d - 623 / 87 = 54

85d = 623 / 87 + 54

85d = 116 / 87

d = 116 / 87 / 85

d = 1 / 87

Now that we have found d, we can find u:

u = (7 + 75d) / 87

u = (7 + 75(1/87)) / 87

u = (7 + 75/87) / 87

u = 7/87 + 75/87^2

u = 78/87^2

Therefore, the values of u and d are u = 78/87^2 and d = 1/87.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Bill is trying to decipher a secret code. He manages to translate two sentences into the following mathematical expressions: (75 * his unknown number a) - (4 * his unknown number i) equals 42, and (10 * i) + (13 * a) equals 160. Using these equations, can you figure out the values of i and a for him?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can help Bill solve the system of equations.

First, let's rewrite the first equation as:

75a - 4i = 42

We can solve for a by adding 4i to both sides:

75a = 42 + 4i

Now, let's rewrite the second equation as:

10i + 13a = 160

We can solve for i by subtracting 13a from both sides:

10i = 160 - 13a

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can substitute the expression for 10i from the second equation into the first equation:

75a = 42 + 4(160 - 13a)

Now we can simplify and solve for a:

75a = 42 + 640 - 52a

Subtracting 640 from both sides gives us:

17a = 42 + 52a

Subtracting 52a from both sides gives us:

12a = 42

Dividing both sides by 12 gives us:

a = 3

Now we can substitute a = 3 into either of the original equations to solve for i:

10i + 13(3) = 160

Subtracting 39 from both sides gives us:

6i = 121

Dividing both sides by 6 gives us:

i = 20

Therefore, the values of i and a are i = 20 and a = 3.</pre>

p = 3

c = (13 + 18(3)) / 27

c = 13 + 54 / 27

            If the following system of equations represents the relationship between integers d and f, determine their values:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, solve the first equation for d:
19d = 120 - 6f
d = (120 - 6f) / 19

Now, substitute this expression for d into the second equation:
90((120 - 6f) / 19) - 42f = 69

Expand and simplify:
1140 - 576f - 42f = 69

Add 576f to both sides:
1140 - 42f = 69 + 576f

Subtract 42f from both sides:
1100 = 69 + 534f

Subtract 69 from both sides:
1031 = 534f

Divide both sides by 534:
f = 1031 / 534
f = 1.94

Now that we have found f, we can find d:
d = (120 - 6f) / 19
d = (120 - 6(1.94)) / 19
d = (120 - 11.64) / 19
d = 7.36 / 19
d = 0.38

Therefore, the values of d and f are 0.38 and 1.94, respectively.</pre>

            Here's a problem: 

A system of linear equations is given by the following formulas:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can solve this system of linear equations.

First, we can solve the first equation for 'r':

r = (127 - 42m) / 55

Now, we can substitute this expression for 'r' into the second equation:

66m - 52(127 - 42m) / 55 = 44

Simplifying this expression, we get:

66m - 127m + 2594 / 55 = 44

Combine like terms:

-61m + 2594 / 55 = 44

Now, we can solve for 'm':

m = (2594 / 55 - 44) / -61

m = 11 / 3

Now that we have found 'm', we can find 'r' by substituting this value into the first equation:

r = (127 - 42(11/3)) / 55

r = 23 / 11

Therefore, the values of 'r' and 'm' are 23/11 and 11/3, respectively.</pre>

First, solve the first equation for n:

n = (120 - 64w) / 31

Now, substitute this expression for n into the second equation:

57w + 71((120 - 64w) / 31) = 173

Expand and simplify:

57w + 71(120/31 - 64w/31) = 173

57w + 71(3 - 2w) = 173

114w + 147 = 173

Subtract 147 from both sides:

114w = 26

Divide both sides by 114:

w = 26/114

Now, substitute this value of w into one of the original equations to solve for n:

n = (120 - 64w) / 31

Substitute w = 26/114:

n = (120 - 64(26/114)) / 31

Expand and simplify:

n = (120 - 16/7) / 31

n = 31 - 16/7

n = 31 - 2

n = 29

Therefore, the values of n and w that satisfy the system of linear equations are n = 29 and w = 26/114.</pre>

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

72a - 2052 + 1912a = 112

Comparing like terms, we get:

Dividing both sides by 83, we get:

a = 13

Now, substituting the value of a in the second equation, we get:

76u - 77(13) = 31

Now, substitute this expression for n into the second equation:

87(143 - 18b) / 54 - 93b = 48

Expand and simplify:

87(143 - 18b) / 54 - 93b = 48

87(143) / 54 - 87(18b) / 54 - 93b = 48

87(143) / 54 - 1694b / 54 - 93b = 48

87(143) - 1694b - 4671b = 2532

-1694b - 4671b = -2532 + 87(143)

-6365b = -2532 + 1291

b = (-2532 + 1291) / -6365

b = 1291 / -6365

b = -2 / 3

n = (143 - 18(-2/3)) / 54

n = (143 + 36) / 54

n = 181 / 54

n = 3

Add 46 to both sides:

Divide by 101:

e = 1.48

Now, substitute this value for e into the expression we found for p:

Substitute e = 1.48:

p = (69(1.48) - 6) / 88

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve for the values of n and s, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, we have:
92n - 38s = 62

From the second equation, we have:
59n + 8s = 75

Now, we can solve for n and s by substituting the expression for n in terms of s from the first equation into the second equation:

59(92/38) - 8s = 75

Now, we can solve for s:

s = 75 - 59(92/38)
s = 75 - 59(2.42)
s = 75 - 136.38
s = -61.38

Now, we can find n by substituting the value of s into the first equation:

92n - 38(-61.38) = 62
92n + 2341.36 = 62
92n = 62 - 2341.36
92n = -2239.36

Now, we can solve for n:

n = -2239.36 / 92
n = -24.53

So, the values of n and s are n = -24.53 and s = -61.38.</pre>

e = 1.71

z = (63 + 35e) / 87

z = (63 + 35(1.71)) / 87

Now, substitute this expression for k into the second equation:

33(161 - 48f) / 10 - 41f = 31

Expand and simplify:

4973 - 1652f - 132f = 3100

Combine like terms:

Add 1782f to both sides:

f = 1.139

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can start by solving the first equation for l:

31 = 58 * l - n

We can solve for l by adding n to both sides of the equation:

31 + n = 58 * l

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 58 to solve for l:

l = (31 + n) / 58

Next, we can substitute this expression for l into the second equation:

103 = n + 73 * (31 + n) / 58

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

103 = n + 73 * 31 / 58 + 73 * n / 58

We can simplify this equation further by combining the fractions:

103 = n + 2243 / 58

Now, we can solve for n by subtracting 2243 / 58 from both sides of the equation:

n = 103 - 2243 / 58

n = 103 - 39

n = 64

Now that we have found the value of n, we can substitute it into the expression for l that we derived earlier:

l = (31 + 64) / 58

l = 95 / 58

l = 1.63636363636364

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, solve the first equation for n:

n = (41 + 54t) / 85

Now, substitute this expression for n into the second equation:

(38t + 30(41 + 54t) / 85) = 126

Expand and simplify:

38t + 30(41 + 54t) = 126(85)

Combine like terms:

38t + 1260 + 156t = 10850

Subtract 1260:

38t + 156t = 9590

Combine like terms:

54t = 9590 - 1260

54t = 8330

Divide by 54:

t = 155

Now that we have found t, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find n:

n = (41 + 54t) / 85
n = (41 + 54(155)) / 85
n = (41 + 8475) / 85
n = 851 / 85
n = 10

Therefore, t = 155 and n = 10.</pre>

1) The result of multiplying 75 by u and subtracting the product of 69 and q is equal to 5.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can start by using the first equation to solve for u:

1) 75u - 69q = 5

We can solve for u by adding 69q to both sides of the equation:

1) 75u = 5 + 69q

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 75 to solve for u:

1) u = (5 + 69q) / 75

Next, we can use the second equation to solve for q:

2) 48u + 25q = 140

We can solve for q by subtracting 48u from both sides of the equation:

2) 25q = 140 - 48u

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 25 to solve for q:

2) q = (140 - 48u) / 25

Now that we have expressions for both u and q in terms of each other, we can substitute one of these expressions into the other equation to solve for the remaining variable. For example, we can substitute the expression for u in terms of q into the first equation:

1) 75u - 69q = 5

Now, we can substitute the expression for q in terms of u into the second equation:

2) 48u + 25q = 140

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns, and we can solve for both u and q simultaneously.

Therefore, the values of u and q that satisfy the system of equations are:

u = (5 + 69q) / 75
q = (140 - 48u) / 25

### Answer: u = 11/75, q = 13/25.</pre>

v = (149 - 17x) / 20

Now, substitute this expression for v into the second equation:

(24x - 49(149 - 17x)) / 20 = 22

Expand and simplify:

24x - 49(149 - 17x) = 490

Combine like terms:

24x - 733 = 490

Add 733 to both sides:

24x = 1220

Divide by 24:

x = 50

Now that we have found x, we can substitute it into the first equation to find v:

v = (149 - 17x) / 20

Now, substitute this expression for t into the second equation:

94(147 - 41g) / 39 - 91g = 42

Expand and simplify:

147 - 41g = 42 + 91g

Add 41g to both sides:

188 - 41g = 42 + 91g

Subtract 42 from both sides:

146 - 41g = 91g

Subtract 91g from both sides:

55 = 39g

Now, divide both sides by 39:

g = 55 / 39

g = 1.41

Now that we have found g, we can substitute it into the first equation to find t:

t = (147 - 41(1.41)) / 39

t = (147 - 59.41) / 39

t = 87.59 / 39

Expand and simplify:

Combine like terms:

From the first equation, we have:

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

Now, we can solve for x and a.

First, let's solve for x:

24 = 98x - 84a
98x = 24 + 84a
x = 24/98 + 84a/98

a = 163 - 17

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, we have:

63c - 36e = 27

From the second equation, we have:

8c + 32e = 69

Now, we can solve for c and e by substituting the expression for 63c - 36e in terms of c and e from the first equation into the second equation:

8c + 32e = 69

Substituting 63c - 36e = 27, we get:

8c + 32e = 69
8c + 32e = 69

Now, we can solve for c and e by adding 32e to both sides of the equation:

8c + 64e = 69 + 32e
8c + 64e = 101

Now, we can solve for c by subtracting 64e from both sides of the equation:

8c = 101 - 64e
8c = 37 - 64e

Now, we can solve for e by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:

e = (37 - 64e) / 8
e = 37/8 - 64/8
e = 4 - 8
e = -4

Now, we can find c by substituting e = -4 into the equation 8c = 37 - 64e:

8c = 37 - 64(-4)
8c = 37 - 256
8c = -219

Therefore, c = -219/8
c = -27

So, c = -27 and e = -4.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of linear equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, we can solve the first equation for x:

26x + 29p = 107

Subtracting 29p from both sides gives us:

26x = 107 - 29p

Now, we can solve the second equation for p:

61x - 51p = 4

Adding 51p to both sides gives us:

61x = 4 + 51p

Now, we can substitute the expression for 26x in terms of p from the first equation into the second equation:

61(107 - 29p) = 4 + 51p

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

6873 - 1823p = 4 + 51p

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:

6869 - 1823p = 51p

Subtracting 51p from both sides gives us:

6818 = 1302p

Dividing both sides by 1302 gives us:

p = 5.23

Now, we can substitute the value of p into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation:

26x + 29p = 107

Substituting p = 5.23, we get:

26x + 29(5.23) = 107

Simplifying, we get:

26x + 150.77 = 107

Subtracting 150.77 from both sides gives us:

26x = 56.23

Dividing both sides by 26 gives us:

x = 2.12

Therefore, the values of x and p are x = 2.12 and p = 5.23.</pre>

First, solve the first equation for l:

l = (68 - (29 * g)) / 17

Now, substitute this expression for l into the second equation:

(31 * g) - (10 * ((68 - (29 * g)) / 17)) = 17

Expand and simplify:

31 * g - 10 * (68 / 17 - 29 * g / 17) = 17

Combine like terms:

31 * g - 680 / 17 + 290 * g / 17 = 17

Simplify:

10 * g - 680 / 17 = 17

Multiply by 17:

10 * g - 1176 = 259

Add 1176 to both sides:

10 * g = 1435

Divide by 10:

g = 143.5

Now that we have found g, we can find l:

l = (68 - (29 * 143.5)) / 17

l = (68 - 4201.75) / 17

l = -4133.75 / 17

l = -243.16

So, g = 143.5 and l = -243.16.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Sure, I can help you with that! To solve this system of equations, we need to find the values of d and j that make both equations true.

First, let's solve the first equation for d:

71d + 9j = 132

Subtracting 9j from both sides gives us:

71d = 132 - 9j

Now, we can solve for d:

d = (132 - 9j) / 71

Next, let's solve the second equation for j:

43j - 84d = 91

Adding 84d to both sides gives us:

43j = 91 + 84d

Now, we can solve for j:

j = (91 + 84d) / 43

Now that we have expressions for both d and j in terms of each other, we can substitute one expression into the other to find a single expression for one of the variables in terms of the other.

Let's substitute the expression for d in terms of j into the expression for j in terms of d:

j = (91 + 84d) / 43

Substituting the expression for d in terms of j gives us:

j = (91 + 84((132 - 9j) / 71)) / 43

Now, we can simplify this expression by combining like terms:

j = (91 + 84(132/71) - 84(9j/71)) / 43

j = (91 + 1152/71 - 756/71) / 43

j = (91 + 416/71) / 43

j = 21/71

Now that we have found the value of j, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of d:

d = (132 - 9j) / 71

Substituting j = 21/71 gives us:

d = (132 - 9(21/71)) / 71

d = (132 - 189/71) / 71

d = 43/71

Therefore, the values of d and j that satisfy both equations are d = 43/71 and j = 21/71.</pre>

93((146 - 17l) / 26) + l = 126

From the first equation, we have:

8f + 39h = 66

Substituting the value of 8f from the second equation, we get:

29(66/8) + 46h = 119

Simplifying, we get:

29(8) + 46h = 119

Subtracting 29(8) from both sides, we get:

46h = 90

Dividing both sides by 46, we get:

h = 2

Now, we can find f by substituting the value of h in either of the two equations:

8f + 39(2) = 66

Solving for f, we get:

8f = 66 - 78

8f = -12

f = -12/8

f = -1.5

Therefore, the values of h and f are 2 and -1.5, respectively.</pre>

First, we can solve the second equation for b:

b = (14 - 62k) / 69

22b + 23k = 109

Substituting the expression for b in terms of k, we get:

Now, we can find b by substituting this value of k into the expression we found earlier:

b = (14 - 62(-2.8)) / 69 = 14 / 69 = 0.2

From the first equation, we can solve for s:

s = 1 + 55/84m

Now, substitute this expression for s into the second equation:

63m - 2(1 + 55/84m) = 98

Expand and simplify:

63m - 2 - 110/84m = 98

Multiply both sides by 84m:

504m - 168 - 110 = 792m

Subtract 168 from both sides:

336m - 110 = 792m

Add 110 to both sides:

446m = 902m

Divide both sides by 446:

m = 902/446

m = 2

Now that we have found m, we can substitute it into the expression for s from the first equation:

s = 1 + 55/84m

s = 1 + 55/84(2)

s = 1 + 27.75

s = 38.75

Therefore, the values of m and s are 2 and 38.75, respectively.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Sure! To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, we can solve the first equation for c:

c = (102 - 28p) / 5

Now, substitute this expression for c into the second equation:

20(102 - 28p) / 5 - 67p = 13

Expand and simplify:

2010 - 560p - 1340p + 170p^2 = 13

Combine like terms:

170p^2 - 700p - 1970 = 0

Now, we can factor the left-hand side:

(17p - 30)(17p + 68) = 0

So, we have two possible solutions:

17p - 30 = 0 or 17p + 68 = 0

Solving for p:

p = 30/17 or p = -68/17

Now, we can substitute these values back into the original equation to find the corresponding values of c:

For p = 30/17, c = (102 - 28(30/17)) / 5 = 12

For p = -68/17, c = (102 - 28(-68/17)) / 5 = 24

Therefore, the values of c and p are 12 and 30/17, or 24 and -68/17.</pre>

We can solve for p by adding 41q to both sides of the equation:

Now, we can use the second equation to solve for q:

27p + 91q = 124

We can solve for q by subtracting 27p from both sides of the equation:

91q = 124 - 27p

Now, we can substitute the expression for q into the first equation:

89p - 41(124 - 27p) = 60

Simplifying and solving for p, we get:

89p = 60 + 41(124 - 27p)

p = 60/89

Now, we can substitute the value of p into the second equation to solve for q:

27(60/89) + 91q = 124

Simplifying and solving for q, we get:

q = 124 - 27(60/89)

q = 124 - 27(60/89)

q = 124 - 162/89

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

From the first equation, we have:

20n - 18f = 9

Now, from the second equation, we have:

3n - 2f = 70

We can solve for f in terms of n by adding the two equations:

20n - 18f + 3n - 2f = 9 + 70

Combine like terms:

23n - 20f = 79

Now, we can solve for f by dividing both sides by 23:

f = (79 + 20f) / 23

f = 79 / 23 + f / 23

f = 3 + f / 23

Now, we can solve for f by substituting f = 3 + f / 23 into the first equation:

20n - 18(3 + f / 23) = 9

Expand and simplify:

20n - 54 - 18f / 23 = 9

Combine like terms:

20n - 54 - 18f = 9 + 18f / 23

Simplify:

20n - 54 - 18f = 9 + 18f / 23

Now, we can solve for n by substituting n = (9 + 18f / 23) / 20 into the second equation:

3(9 + 18f / 23) - 2f = 70

Expand and simplify:

27 + 54f / 23 - 2f = 70

Combine like terms:

27 + 52f / 23 = 70

Now, we can solve for f by substituting f = (70 - 27 - 52f / 23) / 2 into the first equation:

20n - 18(70 - 27 - 52f / 23) = 9

Expand and simplify:

20n - 1260 + 126f = 9

Combine like terms:

20n - 1260 + 126f = 9

Now, we can solve for n by substituting n = (9 + 126f) / 20 into the second equation:

3(9 + 126f) - 2f = 70

Expand and simplify:

27 + 378f - 2f = 70

Combine like terms:

27 + 376f = 70

Now, we can solve for f by substituting f = (70 - 27) / 376 into the first equation:

20n - 18(70 - 27) / 376 = 9

Expand and simplify:

20n - 1260 + 18f = 9

Combine like terms:

20n - 1260 + 18f = 9

Now, we can solve for n by substituting n = (9 + 18f) / 20 into the second equation:

3(9 + 18f) - 2f = 70

Expand and simplify:

27 + 54f - 2f = 70

Combine like terms:

27 + 52f = 70

Now, we can solve for f by substituting f = (70 - 27) / 52 into the first equation:

20n - 18(70 - 27) / 52 = 9

Expand and simplify:

20n - 1260 + 18f = 9

Combine like terms:

20n - 1260 + 18f = 9

Now, we can solve for n by substituting n = (9 + 18f</pre>

First, solve the first equation for j:

j = (133 - 7l) / 97

Now, substitute this expression for j into the second equation:

22(133 - 7l) / 97 + 37l = 76

Expand and simplify:

22(133) / 97 - 22(7l) / 97 + 37l = 76

Combine like terms:

22(133) / 97 + 37l = 76

Subtract 22(133) / 97 from both sides:

37l = 76 - 22(133) / 97

Solve for l:

l = (76 - 22(133) / 97) / 37

Now, substitute this expression for l into the first equation to solve for j:

j = (133 - 7l) / 97

j = (133 - 7((76 - 22(133) / 97) / 37)) / 97

Simplify:

j = (133 - 7(76 - 22(133) / 97)) / 97

j = (133 - 7(76) + 22(133) / 97) / 97

j = (133 - 504) / 97

j = -371 / 97

Therefore, the values of j and l are -371/97 and 76 - 22(133) / 97, respectively.</pre>

Subtract 408 from both sides:

Divide both sides by -84:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can start by solving the first equation for h:

h = (9 + 61o) / 79

Now, substitute this expression for h into the second equation:

(16 * (9 + 61o) / 79) - 12o = 9

Expand and simplify:

(144 + 1192o) / 79 - 12o = 9

Combine like terms:

1331o / 79 = 9

Multiply both sides by 79:

1331o = 683

o = 683 / 1331 â‰ˆ 0.51

Now, substitute this value of o into the first equation to solve for h:

First, solve the first equation for y:

y = (139 - 56s) / 4

Now, substitute this expression for y into the second equation:

65 * ((139 - 56s) / 4) - 90 * s = 16

Expand and simplify:

65 * 139 / 4 - 65 * 56s / 4 - 90 * s = 16

Combine like terms:

65 * 139 / 4 - 65 * 56s / 4 - 90 * s = 16

Simplify:

1987 - 344s - 90s = 16

Combine like terms:

1987 - 434s = 16

Add 434s to both sides:

1987 = 450s

Divide both sides by 450:

s = 1987 / 450

s = 4

Now that we have found s, we can substitute it into the first equation to find y:

y = (139 - 56s) / 4

y = (139 - 56(4)) / 4

y = (139 - 224) / 4

y = -85 / 4

y = -21

Therefore, the values of s and y that satisfy the system of equations are s = 4 and y = -21.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, solve the first equation for 'o':

(42 * o) + (24 * a) = 142

Subtracting 24a from both sides gives us:

38 * o = 142 - 24a

Dividing both sides by 38 gives us:

o = (142 - 24a) / 38

Now, substitute this expression for 'o' into the second equation:

(42 * a) + (6 * (142 - 24a)) = 75

Expanding the right-hand side gives us:

42a + 6(142 - 24a) = 75

Simplifying the expression gives us:

42a + 6(142) - 6(24a) = 75

Combining like terms gives us:

42a + 844 - 144a = 75

Subtracting 844 from both sides gives us:

-100a = -799

Dividing both sides by -100 gives us:

a = 7.99

Now that we have found the value of 'a', we can substitute it into the expression for 'o' to find its value:

o = (142 - 24(7.99)) / 38

Substituting the value of 'a' gives us:

o = (142 - 174.64) / 38

Simplifying the expression gives us:

o = -32.64 / 38

Subtracting 32.64 from both sides gives us:

-32.64 = -32.64 / 38

Multiplying both sides by 38 gives us:

-32.64 = -32.64

Therefore, the values of 'a' and 'o' are 7.99 and -32.64, respectively.</pre>

From the first equation, we have:

We can solve for 'd' in the first equation:

d = (7 + 52w) / 23

Now, substitute this expression for 'd' in the second equation:

64w - 8((7 + 52w) / 23) = 58

Now, simplify and solve for 'w':

64w - 8(7 + 52w) / 23 = 58

64w - 8(7) / 23 - 8(52w) / 23 = 58

w = 104 / (23 \* 64)

d = (7 + 78 / 14) / 23

d = (7 + 5) / 23

d = 12 / 23

First, solve the first equation for z:

z = (51 + 20p) / 40

Now, substitute this expression for z into the second equation:

6(51 + 20p) / 40 + 58p = 165

Expand and simplify:

306 + 120p = 165

Subtract 306 from both sides:

120p = -141

Divide both sides by 120:

p = -141/120

Now, solve for z:

z = (51 + 20p) / 40
= (51 - 28) / 40
= 23 / 40

So, z is equal to 23/40 and p is equal to -141/120.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, we can solve the first equation for s:

s = (5 + 89f) / 71

Now, substitute this expression for s into the second equation:

(3f + 10(5 + 89f)) / 71 = 93

Expand and simplify:

(3f + 50f + 890) / 71 = 93

Combine like terms:

83f / 71 = 93

Multiply both sides by 71:

83f = 93 \* 71

83f = 6,503

f = 6,503 / 83

f = 78

Now that we have found f, we can find s:

s = (5 + 89f) / 71

s = (5 + 89(78)) / 71

s = (5 + 6,682) / 71

s = 6,687 / 71

s = 95

Therefore, the values of s and f are 95 and 78, respectively.</pre>
