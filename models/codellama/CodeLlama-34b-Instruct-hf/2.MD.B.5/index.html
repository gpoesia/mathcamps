We know that the first piece measured 66 feet, so the remaining piece was x - 66 feet.

The contractor then accidentally severed the remaining piece into an additional 19 feet piece, so the total length of the two pieces is x - 66 + 19 = x - 47 feet.

Since the total length of the two pieces is x - 47 feet, we can set up the equation:

x - 47 = x

Simplifying the equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the original length of the ribbon x.

We know that the remaining length of the ribbon after wrapping some of the gifts is 56 centimeters shorter than the original length. This means that the remaining length of the ribbon is x - 56.

We also know that the original length of the ribbon was 81 centimeters. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 56 = 81

To solve for x, we can add 56 to both sides of the equation:

x = 81 + 56

x = 137

So, the original length of the ribbon was 137 centimeters.

Therefore, the remaining length of the ribbon after wrapping some of the gifts is 137 - 56 = 81 centimeters.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many kilometers Sam still needs to run to complete the marathon, we need to subtract the number of kilometers he has already run from the total distance of the marathon.

Let's use a equation to represent this:

Total distance - Distance run = Remaining distance

In this case, the total distance is 50 kilometers, and Sam has already run 27 kilometers. So, we can plug these values into the equation:

50 - 27 = 23

Therefore, Sam still needs to run 23 kilometers to complete the marathon.</pre>

Let's call the distance between Brett's house and his neighbor's house &quot;x&quot;. Then, the distance between Brett's neighbor's house and the park is 19 feet.

So, the distance between Brett's house and the park is x - 19.

We know that the distance between Brett's house and his neighbor's house is 49 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x - 19 = 49

To solve for x, we can add 19 to both sides of the equation:

x = 49 + 19

x = 68

So, the distance between Brett's house and the park is x + 19.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total distance Bob has to cover to reach his destination now, we need to add the distance of the shortcut to the extra distance he needs to drive.

Let's first find the distance of the shortcut:

Distance of shortcut = 94 km - 46 km = 48 km

Now, let's add the distance of the shortcut to the extra distance Bob needs to drive:

Total distance = 48 km + 37 km = 85 km

Therefore, Bob has to cover a total distance of 85 km to reach his destination.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many more feet Jacob needs to build to complete the fence, we need to subtract the length of the fence he has already built from the total length of the fence he wants to build.

79 - 42 = 37

So, Jacob needs to build 37 more feet to complete the fence.</pre>

The original stack of bricks has 10 inches per brick, so the total length of the original stack is:

10 inches x 10 bricks = 100 inches

If the bricklayer adds another brick that is 9 inches long, the total length of the bricks in the stack will be:

100 inches + 9 inches = 109 inches

Therefore, the total length of the bricks in inches is 109 inches.</pre>
