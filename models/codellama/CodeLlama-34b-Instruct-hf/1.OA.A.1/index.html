            In a school competition, Aliyah correctly guesses 11 letter games and then correctly guesses 7 more games. But when she guesses the next game, she loses 6 times. What is the total number of letter games Aliyah correctly guessed in the end?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. Aliyah correctly guesses 11 letter games.
2. She correctly guesses 7 more games after that.
3. She loses 6 times.

We can start by adding the number of games she correctly guessed in the first two steps:

11 + 7 = 18

Now, we need to subtract the number of times she lost:

18 - 6 = 12

So, the total number of letter games Aliyah correctly guessed in the end is 12.</pre>

After the malfunction, it scored 13 - 8 = &lt;&lt;13-8=5&gt;&gt;5 points less, so it scored 5 points in total.
After fixing the issue, William's robot scored an additional 5 points, so it scored a total of 5 + 5 = &lt;&lt;5+5=10&gt;&gt;10 points.

We know that the total number of rooms is 18, so we can set up the equation:

5 + x = 18

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides:

x = 18 - 5

x = 13

Let's first calculate the time it takes to reach the layover:

9 hours

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to reach the final destination:

3 hours

Now, let's add the two times together to get the total flying time:

9 + 3 = 12 hours

Therefore, Emma's total flying time is 12 hours.

Let A be the set of all clowns in the circus, and let B be the set of clowns who decide to leave.

We know that |A| = 14, and we want to find |A \ B|, which is the number of clowns who stay in the circus.

We can represent the situation as follows:

|A| = 14
|B| = 7 + 3 = 10
|A âˆ© B| = 0 (since no clown decides to leave and stay at the same time)

Using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, we can find |A \ B| as follows:

|A \ B| = |A| - |A âˆ© B| = 14 - 0 = 14

Therefore, there are 14 clowns left at the circus.</pre>
