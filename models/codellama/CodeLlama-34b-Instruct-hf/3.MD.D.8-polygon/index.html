        A sum of several measurements taken along the edge of a plot of land totals to 368 miles. The individual measurements are 41 miles, 28 miles, 90 miles, 32 miles, 10 miles, and 98 miles. What is the remaining measurement that hasn't been included in the total yet?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the remaining measurement &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the sum of all the measurements is 368 miles, so we can set up the following equation:

41 + 28 + 90 + 32 + 10 + 98 + x = 368

Simplifying the equation:

241 + x = 368

Subtracting 241 from both sides:

x = 127

x = 468 - (17 + 13 + 61 + 16 + 11 + 83 + 28 + 48 + 93)

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the length of each side of a regular octagon, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a regular polygon, which is:

Perimeter = n x side length

where n is the number of sides and side length is the length of each side.

In this case, the perimeter is 800m and the number of sides is 8, so we can set up the equation:

800 = 8 x side length

To solve for the side length, we can divide both sides by 8:

100 = side length

Therefore, the length of each side of the regular octagon is 100m.</pre>

In this case, the perimeter is given as 287 meters, and the number of sides is 7. So, we can set up the equation:

287 = (7) x (side length)

To solve for the side length, we can divide both sides by 7:

287 / 7 = side length

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the length of the last side &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. So, we can set up an equation based on that:

39 + 26 + 47 + 52 + 66 + 17 + x = 356

Simplifying the equation:

26 + 47 + 52 + 66 + 17 + x = 356 - 39

26 + 47 + 52 + 66 + 17 + x = 317

Subtracting 26 from both sides:

19 + 47 + 52 + 66 + 17 + x = 291

Subtracting 47 from both sides:

19 + 52 + 66 + 17 + x = 244

Subtracting 52 from both sides:

19 + 66 + 17 + x = 192

Subtracting 66 from both sides:

19 + 17 + x = 126

Subtracting 19 from both sides:
