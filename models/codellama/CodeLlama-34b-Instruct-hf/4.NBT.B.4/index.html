Let's call the distance between the moon and the nearest satellite &quot;x&quot; kilometers. Then, the distance between the moon and the farthest satellite is also &quot;x&quot; kilometers, since the moon is at the same distance from both satellites.

So, the total distance covered by the moon to the satellites is:

x + x = 2x

Since the distance between the moon and the nearest satellite is 2976 kilometers, we can substitute this value into the equation:

* Last month, the company produced 6374 toothbrushes.
* This month, the company produced 93 more toothbrushes than last month.

We can use this information to set up an equation to represent the total number of toothbrushes produced this month. Let's call the total number of toothbrushes produced this month &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the company produced 93 more toothbrushes this month than last month, so we can write an equation based on that:

x = 6374 + 93

Simplifying the equation:

x = 6467

Therefore, the total number of toothbrushes the company made this month is 6467.

We can use this information to set up an equation to represent the number of toothbrushes left with the company after distribution. Let's call the number of toothbrushes left with the company after distribution &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the company produced a total number of toothbrushes this month, and they distributed 5927 toothbrushes to various pharmacies. Therefore, the number of toothbrushes left with the company after distribution is:

x = total number of toothbrushes produced this month - 5927

We know that the total number of toothbrushes produced this month is 6467, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

Simplifying the equation:

x = 540

Therefore, the number of toothbrushes left with the company after distribution is 540.

            In a revision to the previous problem:

Suppose that, last month, the toothbrush manufacturing company actually produced 6374 toothbrushes, and this month, they increased production by an even larger margin and made 2933 more toothbrushes than last month. What would be the new total number of toothbrushes the company made this month?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* Last month, the company produced 6374 toothbrushes.
* This month, the company produced 2933 more toothbrushes than last month.

We can use this information to set up an equation to represent the total number of toothbrushes produced this month. Let's call the total number of toothbrushes produced this month &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the company produced 2933 more toothbrushes this month than last month, so we can write an equation based on that:

x = 6374 + 2933

Simplifying the equation:

x = 9307

Therefore, the new total number of toothbrushes the company made this month is 9307.

Let's call the number of seconds that Roberta saw &quot;x&quot;. Then, we know that the clock showed 5259 seconds, and Roberta saw 4407 seconds. So, we can set up the following equation:

5259 - x = 4407

To solve for &quot;x&quot;, we can subtract 4407 from both sides of the equation:

5259 - 4407 = x

This gives us:

x = 852

We know that the total number of beads at the beginning is 8940, and the number of beads left after making the necklaces is 3259. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

8940 - x = 3259

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

8940 = 3259 + x

Subtracting 3259 from both sides gives us:

5681 = x

So, 5681 beads were used to make the necklaces.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the information given in the problem to set up an equation.

Let x be the number of fish that are still alive.

We know that the total number of fish in the pond is 6571.

We also know that 516 fish died due to the disease.

So, the number of fish that are still alive is equal to the total number of fish minus the number of fish that died.

x = 6571 - 516

x = 6055

Therefore, there are 6055 fish still alive in the pond.</pre>

We know that the total number of gallons the company had at the beginning of the day was 9955.

We also know that the number of gallons remaining after the day of distribution was 5517.

So, we can set up the equation:

9955 - x = 5517

To solve for x, we can subtract 9955 from both sides of the equation:

x = 4438

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  The elephant sanctuary currently holds 8483 elephants.

If the sanctuary rescued 118 more elephants, the total number of elephants in the sanctuary is:

8483 + 118 = 8601

Therefore, there are 8601 elephants in the sanctuary now.</pre>

            A farmer had a successful year and harvested 5580 kg of potatoes. Unfortunately, 588 kg of these potatoes were of a low quality and couldn't be sold. How many kilograms of potatoes does the farmer have that are of good quality and can be sold?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the number of kilograms of potatoes that are of good quality and can be sold, we need to subtract the number of low-quality potatoes from the total number of potatoes harvested.

Let's use the information given in the problem to set up an equation:

Total number of potatoes harvested = 5580 kg
Number of low-quality potatoes = 588 kg

Now, let's subtract the number of low-quality potatoes from the total number of potatoes harvested:

5580 - 588 = 5092 kg

So, the farmer has 5092 kg of potatoes that are of good quality and can be sold.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the number of grains of sand left in the sandbox, we need to subtract the number of grains of sand removed from the total number of grains of sand.

Let's use the information given in the problem to set up an equation:

9007 - 2233 = x

Where x is the number of grains of sand left in the sandbox.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 9007 - 2233
= 6774

Therefore, there are 6774 grains of sand left in the sandbox.</pre>

            A strong wind gust was measured at 4245 km/h. After a while, the speed went down by 1152 km/h. What speed did the wind gust reduce to?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the reduced speed of the wind gust, we need to subtract the amount by which the speed went down from the original speed.

Original speed: 4245 km/h

Reduced speed: 4245 - 1152 = 3093 km/h

Therefore, the wind gust reduced to 3093 km/h.</pre>
