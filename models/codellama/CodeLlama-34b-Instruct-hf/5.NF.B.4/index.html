        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To determine how many pizzas the group should order, we need to calculate the total number of slices of pizza that the students will eat.

Let's start by converting the fraction 17/20 to a decimal.

17/20 = 0.85

Now, we can multiply the decimal by the number of students to get the total number of slices of pizza that the students will eat.

0.85 x 18 = 15.3

So, the students will eat a total of 15.3 slices of pizza.

To determine how many pizzas the group should order, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza. Let's assume that each pizza has 8 slices.

15.3 Ã· 8 = 1.91

Since we can't order a fraction of a pizza, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

1.91 â‰ˆ 2

Therefore, the group should order 2 pizzas.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many pounds of apples Sophie used in total, we need to multiply the number of pies she made by the amount of apples required for each pie.

We know that each pie requires about 1/14 of the total apples Sophie picked, so we can write this as:

(9/14) * 7

To simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number. In this case, we can multiply both by 7:

(9/14) * 7 = (63/98)

Since the result is a fraction, we can simplify it further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. In this case, the GCD of 63 and 98 is 3, so we can divide both numbers by 3:

(63/98) = (21/32)

Therefore, Sophie used 21 pounds of apples in total to make her 7 apple pies.</pre>

2 boxes x 6/8 of a dozen = 2 x 6/8 = 3/4 of a dozen

So, John bought 3/4 of a dozen cookies. To find the total number of dozens of cookies he bought, we can divide the number of cookies he bought by 12:

3/4 of a dozen / 12 = 3/4 x 12 = 9/4 = 2 1/4 dozens

The design of the box allows it to be filled up to 16/17 of its capacity, which means that 1/17 of the box is lost. To find the amount that is lost, we can multiply the capacity of the box by the fraction that is lost:

6 gallons x 1/17 = 0.35 gallons

So, 0.35 gallons of paint are lost due to the design of the box. To find the actual capacity of the box, we need to subtract the amount that is lost from the maximum capacity:

6 gallons - 0.35 gallons = 5.65 gallons

Therefore, Tom can actually store 5.65 gallons of paint in the box.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the result of the problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 13 by 10: 13 Ã· 10 = 1.3
2. Divide 14 by 11: 14 Ã· 11 = 1.2727...
3. Multiply the results: 1.3 Ã— 1.2727... = 1.6493...

Therefore, the result of the problem is 1.6493...

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, which is 3 in this case:

1.6493... Ã· 3 = 0.5497...

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the length of each part of the bird house, we need to divide the initial length of the piece of wood by the number of parts.

Let's use the information given in the problem:

* The initial length of the piece of wood is 16 units.
* Maddison uses 2/19 of the piece of wood for each part of the bird house.

To find the length of each part, we can set up the following equation:

16 / 2/19 = x

Where x is the length of each part.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 19/2:

16 \* 19/2 = x \* 19/2

Simplifying the equation:

16 \* 9.5 = x \* 9.5

x = 16 \* 9.5 / 9.5 = 16

So, each part of the bird house is 16 units long.</pre>

Then, we simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers.

In this case, the product of the two fractions is:

(18 / 18) x (11 / 5) = (18 x 11) / (18 x 5) = 198 / 90

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD of 18 and 5, which is 3.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is:

198 / 90 = 66 / 30

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the result when 5/14 of a whole is multiplied by 18, we need to first convert 5/14 to a decimal.

5/14 = 0.357142857142857

Now, we can multiply 0.357142857142857 by 18:

0.357142857142857 x 18 = 6.61

So, the result when 5/14 of a whole is multiplied by 18 is 6.61.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the multiplication of fractions and integers, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, we multiply the numerators: 11 x 5 = 55

Then, we multiply the denominators: 8 x 5 = 40

Finally, we simplify the result: 55 / 40 = 13/8

Therefore, the result of (11/8) * 5 is 13/8.</pre>
