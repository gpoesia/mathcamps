            A full-grown giraffe has an average height of 40.4 feet. If a baby giraffe is 7.34 feet shorter than the full-grown giraffe, then how tall is the baby giraffe?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the information given in the problem to set up an equation.

Let x be the height of the baby giraffe.

We know that the average height of a full-grown giraffe is 40.4 feet.

We also know that the baby giraffe is 7.34 feet shorter than the full-grown giraffe.

So, we can write an equation based on this information:

x + 7.34 = 40.4

To solve for x, we can subtract 7.34 from both sides of the equation:

x = 40.4 - 7.34

x = 33.06

Therefore, the baby giraffe is 33.06 feet tall.</pre>

The sale price of the skirt is $P - $37.5.

Simplifying this equation, we get:

So, we can calculate the number of liters of water in each bucket as follows:

            A snowball that was 15.8 inches in diameter was rolled and grew at a constant rate until it was 30.8 times its original size. What is the size of the snowball now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The snowball grew at a constant rate, so the rate at which it grew is the same at any point in time. Let's call the original size of the snowball x. Then, the size of the snowball after it was rolled and grew is 30.8x.

We know that the diameter of the snowball was 15.8 inches, so the radius of the snowball is half of that, or 7.9 inches. The volume of a sphere (such as a snowball) is given by the formula (4/3)Ï€r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.

So, the volume of the original snowball is (4/3)Ï€(7.9)^3 = &lt;&lt;(4/3)Ï€(7.9)^3=11.67&gt;&gt;11.67 cubic inches.

The volume of the snowball after it was rolled and grew is 30.8 times the volume of the original snowball, so the volume of the snowball now is 30.8(11.67) = &lt;&lt;30.8(11.67)=364.36&gt;&gt;364.36 cubic inches.

The radius of the snowball now is half of the diameter, so the radius is 364.36/2 = &lt;&lt;364.36/2=182.18&gt;&gt;182.18 inches.

The diameter of the snowball now is twice the radius, so the diameter is 2(182.18) = &lt;&lt;2(182.18)=364.36&gt;&gt;364.36 inches.

Therefore, the size of the snowball now is 364.36 inches in diameter.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the cost for 63.2 minutes of observation time, we need to multiply the cost per minute by the number of minutes.

Cost per minute = $6.9
Number of minutes = 63.2

Cost for 63.2 minutes = $6.9 x 63.2 = $425.38

Therefore, the cost for 63.2 minutes of observation time with a powerful telescope would be $425.38.</pre>
