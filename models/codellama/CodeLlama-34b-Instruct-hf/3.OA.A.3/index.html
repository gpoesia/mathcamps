To find the total number of magic dust particles created by all the fairies in a cluster, we need to multiply the number of fairies per house by the number of houses in the cluster and then multiply that result by the number of magic dust particles created by each fairy per day.

4 fairies per house x 3 houses in a cluster = 12 fairies in the cluster

We know that the total number of books is equal to the number of rows times the number of books in a row, so we can set up the following equation:

x^2 = 8x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x^2 - 8x = 0

Factoring the equation, we get:

(x - 4)(x + 2) = 0

Since we are looking for a positive solution, we can see that x = 4 is the only solution.

So, there are 4 rows and 4 books in each row, for a total of 4^2 = 16 books.</pre>

Melanie needs 3 sleeping bags per friend, and she has 4 friends. Therefore, the total number of sleeping bags needed is:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that Johnny has 3 times the amount of snowballs that Billy does. We can write this as:

Johnny has 3x snowballs

We know that Billy has 6 snowballs, so we can write this as:

Billy has 6 snowballs

Now, we can equate the two expressions to find the number of snowballs that Johnny has:

3x = 6

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 6/3

x = 2

So, Johnny has 2 times the amount of snowballs that Billy does. Therefore, Johnny has 2x = 2(6) = 12 snowballs.

Let's assume that each level is still 11 feet high.

The camping area is 44 square meters, and we want to divide it into 11 equal sections. To do this, we can divide the area by 11:

44 mÂ² Ã· 11 = 4 mÂ² per section

Now, we need to find the total number of campers that can fit in each section. We know that each tent can accommodate 12 campers, so we can multiply the area of each section by 12:

4 mÂ² x 12 = 48 campers per section

Since there are 11 sections, we can multiply the number of campers per section by 11 to find the total number of campers that can camp in the camping area:

48 campers per section x 11 sections = 528 campers

Therefore, there can be a maximum of 528 campers in the camping area.</pre>
