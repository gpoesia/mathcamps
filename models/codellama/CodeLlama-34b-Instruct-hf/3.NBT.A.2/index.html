Let's use a Venn diagram to represent the situation:

| Registered dogs | 976 |
| Moving away | 586 |
| Still registered | ? |

We can see that the number of dogs that moved away is a subset of the original number of registered dogs. So, we can use the formula for the difference of two sets to find the number of dogs still registered:

Still registered = Registered dogs - Moving away
= 976 - 586

So, the number of tigers that remain in the sanctuary is equal to the initial number of tigers minus the number of tigers that have left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many days the new toothpaste will last for the family, we need to calculate the total number of days the toothpaste will last for the family.

Let's assume the family uses the toothpaste at a constant rate, meaning they use an equal amount of toothpaste every day.

The old toothpaste lasted for 521 days, which means the family used 521/365 = 1.44 tubes of toothpaste per year.

The new toothpaste claims to last for 10 days longer than the old toothpaste. So, the family will use 10/365 = 0.027 tubes of toothpaste per year more with the new toothpaste.

Therefore, the total number of days the new toothpaste will last for the family is:
521 + 0.027 = 521.027 days

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how much fuel the astronaut has left, we need to subtract the amount of fuel used from the total amount of fuel he had at the beginning of the journey.

Let's first convert the weight of the fuel from kilograms to grams:

So, the astronaut had 866 kilograms x 1000 grams/kilogram = 866,000 grams of fuel at the beginning of the journey.

Now, let's convert the amount of fuel used from kilograms to grams:

1 kilogram = 1000 grams

So, the astronaut used 196 kilograms x 1000 grams/kilogram = 196,000 grams of fuel during takeoff and the initial part of the journey.

Now, let's subtract the amount of fuel used from the total amount of fuel the astronaut had at the beginning of the journey:

        In the art class, there are initially 91 colored pencils available. Then, another batch of 738 colored pencils is added to the stock. How many colored pencils are there in the art class now?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Initially, there are 91 colored pencils available.

When another batch of 738 colored pencils is added, the total number of colored pencils becomes:

91 + 738 = &lt;&lt;91+738=829&gt;&gt;829

Therefore, there are 829 colored pencils in the art class now.

        Following up from the last problem, suppose the art class receives an additional donation of 67 colored pencils after the previous batch. How many colored pencils are there in the art class now with the additional set?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

After the previous batch of 738 colored pencils was added, there were 829 colored pencils in the art class.

When 67 colored pencils are added as a donation, the total number of colored pencils becomes:

829 + 67 = &lt;&lt;829+67=996&gt;&gt;996

Therefore, there are 996 colored pencils in the art class now with the additional set.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Team Alpha has created 164 robot parts and team Beta has created 436 robot parts.
Total number of robot parts created by both teams = 164 + 436 = &lt;&lt;164+436=600&gt;&gt;600.

To find the number of unaccounted for or missing robot parts, we need to subtract the total number of robot parts created by both teams from the original number of robot parts, which is 668.

668 - 600 = &lt;&lt;668-600=68&gt;&gt;68.

Therefore, there are 68 robot parts unaccounted for or missing from both teams' creations.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use &quot;L&quot; to represent the number of animals the zoo lost.

We know that the zoo had 427 animals last year and that a few animals were exchanged with another zoo, resulting in the number of animals becoming 341.

So, we can write an equation to represent this situation:

427 - L = 341

Solving for &quot;L&quot;, we get:

L = 427 - 341
L = 86

Therefore, the zoo lost 86 animals.</pre>
