            After a birthday party, you see one piece of cake left. If you originally had a whole cake that was cut into h slices, and each slice was equal in size, then how many slices were there in the whole cake, given that 12 pieces have been eaten during the party?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  If the cake was cut into equal sized pieces, and there is one piece left after the party, then the number of slices in the whole cake must have been a multiple of 12.

Let's assume that the cake was cut into x slices. Since each slice is equal in size, there must be x/12 pieces in each slice.

After the party, 12 pieces have been eaten, so there are x - 12 pieces left. Since each piece is equal to 1/12 of the cake, there are (x - 12)/12 slices left.

Since there is one piece left, we can set up the equation:

(x - 12)/12 = 1

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12 \* 12 = 144

Therefore, there were 144 slices in the whole cake.</pre>

Let G be the set of green crayons and NG be the set of non-green crayons.

We know that G âˆ© NG = âˆ…, since green and non-green crayons are mutually exclusive.

We also know that G âˆª NG = 13, since Samantha has 13 crayons in total.

Using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, we can write:

|G| + |NG| = |G âˆª NG|

Substituting the values we know, we get:

Let A be the set of sleeping bags that the camper has in their tent.
Let B be the set of sleeping bags that the camper's friends bring.
Let C be the set of all sleeping bags that the camper and their friends have.

We know that A has 4 sleeping bags, so |A| = 4.
We also know that B has 11 sleeping bags, so |B| = 11.

We want to find |C|, which is the number of sleeping bags that the camper and their friends have in total.

We can use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to find |C|.

|C| = |A âˆª B| = |A| + |B| - |A âˆ© B|

We know that |A| = 4 and |B| = 11, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

|C| = |A âˆª B| = 4 + 11 - |A âˆ© B|

We know that |A âˆ© B| = 0, because the camper and their friends do not share any sleeping bags.

So, |C| = |A âˆª B| = 4 + 11 - 0 = 15

where y is the number of letter blocks that were removed from the game station.

We know that x = 6, because there were initially 6 letter blocks. So, we can substitute x = 6 into the equation:

6 - y = 1

To solve for y, we can add y to both sides of the equation:

6 - y + y = 1 + y

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use a system of linear equations to solve this problem.

Let x be the number of cans of beans that were distributed.

We know that at the beginning of the day, there were 17 cans of beans in the pantry.

We also know that at the end of the day, there were 13 cans of beans left.

So, we can write the first equation:

17 - x = 13

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 4

So, 4 cans of beans were distributed that day.</pre>

Therefore, the number of picks John started with is 5 + 6 = 11.

7

During the day, the florist adds some more daisies. Let's assume they add x daisies, where x is a positive integer. After adding the extra daisies, the total number of daisies is 9. So, we can write an equation to represent this:

7 + x = 9

To find the value of x, we can solve the equation:

7 + x = 9

Subtract 7 from both sides:

x = 9 - 7

x = 2

1. The small snowman is built using 3 large snowballs.
2. The snowman grows by an additional number of snowballs.
3. The snowman becomes comprised of a total of 4 large snowballs.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the answer to the problem. We know that the snowman starts with 3 large snowballs and then grows by an additional number of snowballs. This means that the total number of snowballs the snowman has after it grows is 3 + x, where x is the number of snowballs it grows by.

We also know that the snowman becomes comprised of a total of 4 large snowballs. This means that the total number of snowballs the snowman has after it grows is equal to 4.

So, we can set up the following equation:

3 + x = 4

To solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 4 - 3

x = 1

Therefore, the snowman grows by 1 additional snowball.</pre>

This equation tells us that the total number of picture puzzles the puzzle maker had created by the end of this month (11 + x) is equal to the total number of picture puzzles he has now (20).

To find the value of &quot;x&quot;, we can solve the equation. We can do this by subtracting 11 from both sides of the equation:

We also know that the number of tigers lost is equal to the difference between the original number of tigers and the number of tigers that are left. So, we can write:

T - T = 15 - 5

Simplifying this equation, we get:

T = 10

Therefore, 10 tigers were lost.</pre>

Let x be the number of jackets the Jackson family purchased at the yard sale.

The total number of jackets the Jackson family has now is 12.

The number of jackets the Jackson family had before the yard sale is 6.

So, the equation is:

6 + x = 12

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 12 - 6

x = 6

So, the Jackson family purchased 6 jackets at the yard sale.</pre>

We know that the train initially had 16 cars and after detaching some cars, it had 8 cars left. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

16 - x = 8

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

16 = 8 + x

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

8 = x

So, 8 cars were detached during the journey.

Let A be the set of students who were dropped off at their schools, and let B be the set of students who remained on the bus. We know that A âˆ© B = 7, since there were 7 students left on the bus after some students were dropped off.

We also know that A âˆª B = 14, since there were 14 students on the bus in the beginning.

Using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, we can find the number of students who were dropped off by subtracting the number of students who remained on the bus from the total number of students on the bus:

A âˆª B = 14
A âˆ© B = 7

Therefore, the number of students who were dropped off is:

Let A represent the set of all pillows that are stuffed with feathers, and let B represent the set of all pillows that are stuffed with foam.

We know that 4 pillows are stuffed with feathers, so A has 4 elements. We also know that the total number of pillows is 6, so the universal set (or the set of all pillows) has 6 elements.

Using the information-gathering formula, we can write:

|A| = 4
|B| = ?
|A âˆ© B| = 0
|A âˆª B| = 6

We know that A and B are disjoint sets, so the intersection of A and B is empty. Therefore, |A âˆ© B| = 0.

We also know that the union of A and B is the universal set, so |A âˆª B| = 6.

Now, we can use the formula for the sum of two sets to find the number of pillows that are stuffed with foam:

|B| = |A âˆª B| - |A|
= 6 - 4
= 2

Therefore, there are 2 pillows that are stuffed with foam.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use a mathematical equation to solve this problem. Let x be the number of monkeys that were transferred.

We know that the total number of monkeys in the enclosure after the transfer is 7. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

7 = 6 + x

Where 6 is the number of monkeys that were already in the enclosure.

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

7 - 6 = x

This simplifies to:

x = 1

So, 1 monkey was transferred into the enclosure.</pre>

We know that the total number of gold coins he found is 16, so we can set up the equation:

To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides:

x = 16 - 7

x = 9

To solve for x, we can add 14 to both sides of the equation:

Let A represent the set of all 11 songs prepared by the band.
Let B represent the set of all 7 songs performed by the band.
Let C represent the set of all songs not performed by the band due to technical problems.

We know that C is a subset of A, since all songs not performed by the band are a subset of all songs prepared by the band.
We also know that B is a subset of A, since all songs performed by the band are a subset of all songs prepared by the band.

Using the Venn diagram, we can represent the situation as follows:

A = {all 11 songs prepared by the band}
B = {all 7 songs performed by the band}
C = {all songs not performed by the band due to technical problems}

We want to find the number of songs in set C, which is the number of songs not performed by the band due to technical problems.

We can do this by using the formula for the difference of two sets:

C = A - B

Substituting the values we know, we get:

C = {all songs not performed by the band due to technical problems} = {all 11 songs prepared by the band} - {all 7 songs performed by the band}
