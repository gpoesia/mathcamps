        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the time it will take to fully inflate the beach ball, we need to divide the total volume of air needed by the rate at which the ball is being filled.

Total volume of air needed = 73841 cubic centimeters
Rate at which the ball is being filled = 41 cubic centimeters per second

Time = Total volume / Rate
Time = 73841 / 41

Let's use the information given in the problem to set up the equation:

Pens produced = Total number of hours worked x Pens produced per hour

We know that the total number of pens produced is 2526 and the total number of hours worked is 842. We also know that the pens were produced at an equal pace all the time, so we can assume that the pens produced per hour is constant.

Now, let's plug in the values we know into the equation:

2526 = 842 x Pens produced per hour

To solve for Pens produced per hour, we can divide both sides of the equation by 842:

Pens produced per hour = 2526 / 842

Pens produced per hour = 3

So, the pens were produced at a rate of 3 pens per hour.</pre>

2118 windows \* 0.0517 square feet per window = 110.5 square feet of glass

We can use the formula d = rt, where d is the total distance traveled, r is the distance per jump, and t is the number of jumps.

We know that the total distance traveled is 12288 centimeters, and the number of jumps is 512. So, we can plug these values into the formula:

d = rt
12288 = r(512)

Now, we can solve for r, which is the distance per jump:

r = d/t
r = 12288/512
r = 24

So, the frog jumps 24 centimeters per jump.</pre>
