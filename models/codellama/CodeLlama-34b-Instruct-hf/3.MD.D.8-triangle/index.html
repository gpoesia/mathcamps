We know that the perimeter of a triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 997m, and we know that two of the sides have lengths of 2m and 667m.

So, we can set up the following equation:

2m + 667m + x = 997m

Simplifying the equation:

669m + x = 997m

Subtracting 669m from both sides:

Let's call the length of the third side x.

We know that the perimeter of a triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter of the triangle is 898m.

We also know that the sum of the lengths of two sides of a triangle is equal to the length of the third side. So, we can set up the following equation:

250 + 435 + x = 898

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 898 - 250 - 435

x = 213

An equilateral triangle is a triangle with all sides of equal length. Since the total perimeter of the triangle is 405 cm, we can use the formula P = 3s, where P is the perimeter and s is the length of each side.

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

An equilateral triangle is a triangle with all sides of equal length. Since the perimeter of the triangle is given as 591 cm, we can use the formula P = 3s, where P is the perimeter and s is the length of each side, to find the length of each side.

P = 3s
591 = 3s

s = 591 / 3
s = 197

            In a large triangular garden, one of its sides is 147m and another side is 590m. If the perimeter of the garden is 792m, can you find the length of the third side?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can help you with that!

Let's call the length of the third side x.

We know that the perimeter of the garden is equal to the sum of the lengths of all three sides: 147 + 590 + x = 792.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

147 + 590 = 792 - x

Subtracting 147 from both sides gives us:

443 = 792 - x

Subtracting 590 from both sides gives us:

-147 = -x

Therefore, the length of the third side is -147 meters.</pre>

In this case, the perimeter of the triangle is 723 cm, so the side length is:

side length = 241 cm

We know that the perimeter of a triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all three sides. In this case, the perimeter is 738m.

Subtracting 415 from both sides:

We know that the perimeter of a triangle is equal to the sum of its sides, so we can set up the equation:

472 + x + (784 - 472) = 784

Simplifying the equation:

472 + x + 312 = 784

Combine like terms:

884 + x = 784

Subtract 884 from both sides:

x = -100

But we know that the length of a side of a triangle cannot be negative, so we must have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's check our work.

We made a mistake when we added 312 to both sides of the equation. The correct equation should be:

472 + x + 312 = 784

Subtract 472 from both sides:

x + 312 = 312

Subtract 312 from both sides:

x = 0

So, the length of the third side of the triangle is 0.</pre>

We know that the perimeter of a triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 930 meters, and we know that two of the sides have lengths of 537 meters and 68 meters, respectively.

So, we can set up the following equation:

In this case, we are given that the perimeter is 909m, and we know two of the sides: a = 368m and b = 230m.

So, we can set up the equation:

P = a + b + c
909 = 368 + 230 + c

Now we need to solve for c. To do this, we can subtract 368 + 230 from both sides of the equation:

c = 909 - 368 - 230
c = 211

So, the length of the third side of the scalene triangle is 211m.</pre>

We know that the perimeter of a triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 568m, and we know that two of the sides have lengths of 110m and 205m.

So, we can set up the following equation:

110 + 205 + x = 568

Simplifying the equation:

315 + x = 568

Subtracting 315 from both sides:

x = 253

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 253m.</pre>
