            John has been learning to add and subtract fractions at school. He was given a problem during his homework that puzzled him. He had to take the sum of 48/56 and 95/23 and then subtract 34/26 from the result. What was the value that John found for this operation? Answer in simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Add 48/56 and 95/23:

48/56 + 95/23 = (48 Ã— 23) + (95 Ã— 56) / (56 Ã— 23)
= 2163 + 2100 / 1296
= 2163 + 8 / 1296
= 2163 + 1/1024
= 2163.0009

So, the sum of 48/56 and 95/23 is 2163.0009.

2. Subtract 34/26 from the result:

2163.0009 - 34/26 = 2163.0009 - 34/26
= 2163.0009 - 14/26
= 2163.0009 - 0.56
= 2158.4391

So, the final answer is 2158.4391.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is 195. Then, we can add the numerators and simplify the fraction.

88/9 + 28/65 = (88 x 65) / (9 x 65) + (28 x 9) / (9 x 65)
= (88 x 65) / 195 + (28 x 9) / 195
= 5,645 / 195 + 4,416 / 195
= 10,061 / 195

To subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result, we need to find the LCM of the denominators, which is 195. Then, we can subtract the numerators and simplify the fraction.

10,061/195 - 18/37 = (10,061 x 37) / 195 - (18 x 195) / 37
= (10,061 x 37) / 195 - (18 x 195) / 37
= 3,393,705 / 195 - 5,142 / 37
= 3,388,563 / 195

The result is 3,388,563/195, which is equal to 185 1/195.</pre>

(44 / 50) = 1 + (44 - 50) / 50 = 1 + -6 / 50 = -5 / 50

Therefore, (63 / 41) + (44 / 50) = 3 / 2 + (-5 / 50) = -3 / 50.

This is a simplified fraction, so we can simplify it further:

((75 / 45) + (5 / 49)) = (15 / 45) + (1 / 49) = (15 + 1) / (45 + 49) = 30 / 94

$$\frac{93}{34} - \frac{77}{74}$$

To simplify this expression, we can first simplify the fractions:

$$\frac{93}{34} = \frac{3}{2}$$

$$\frac{77}{74} = \frac{11}{14}$$

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:

$$\frac{3}{2} - \frac{11}{14} = \frac{3-11}{2\cdot 14} = \frac{-8}{2\cdot 14} = -\frac{4}{7}$$

Therefore, the simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  The result of 92/75 + 66/92 is 15/15.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Simplify the fractions: 92/75 = 1 1/5 and 66/92 = 1 1/6
2. Add the numerators: 1 1/5 + 1 1/6 = 2 2/15
3. Add the denominators: 15 + 15 = 30
4. Divide the numerator by the denominator: 2 2/15 / 30 = 1 1/15
5. Simplify the fraction: 1 1/15 = 15/15

Therefore, the result of 92/75 + 66/92 is 15/15.</pre>

Since Olivia has read the same amount of novel as Evan, she has read the same fraction of the novel as Evan. Therefore, Olivia has read the same fraction of the novel as Evan, which is 51/18.

2. Add the two fractions:

49/14 = 3/7

To add these fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. The LCM of 3 and 7 is 10.

So, the sum of 73/39 and 49/14 is:

(2/3) + (3/7) = (2 + 3)/(3 \* 7) = (5)/(3 \* 7) = 5/21

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

5/21 = 1/4

Therefore, the sum of 73/39 and 49/14 is 1/4.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate 79/1 - 30/92, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 79 by 1: 79/1 = 79
2. Divide 30 by 92: 30/92 = 0.3333333333333333
3. Subtract 0.3333333333333333 from 79: 79 - 0.3333333333333333 = 78.66666666666666

So, the result of 79/1 - 30/92 is 78.66666666666666.

Now, to subtract 61/63 from the result, we need to follow the order of operations again:

1. Divide 61 by 63: 61/63 = 0.9636363636363636
2. Subtract 0.9636363636363636 from 78.66666666666666: 78.66666666666666 - 0.9636363636363636 = 77.60283018867927

So, the final result is 77.60283018867927.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To subtract fractions, we need to follow the correct order of operations. First, we need to perform the subtraction inside the parentheses, which gives us:

(93 / 46) - (51 / 84) = (93 / 46) - (51 / 84)

Next, we need to simplify the fractions inside the parentheses. We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two fractions. In this case, the GCD of (93/46) and (51/84) is 13. So, we can simplify the fractions as follows:

(93 / 46) = 2 / 3
(51 / 84) = 3 / 8

Now, we can subtract the two simplified fractions:

2/3 - 3/8 = 2/3 - 3/8

This simplifies to:

2/3 - 3/8 = 1/3

Therefore, the simplified fraction of the subtraction of (93/46) and (51/84) is 1/3.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  The wholesaler has 41/26 barrels of olive oil in their warehouse. They sell a portion of the oil which is equivalent to 41/72 barrels.

To find out how much olive oil the wholesaler has now, we need to subtract the amount they sold from the total amount they had.

41/26 - 41/72 = 1/72 - 1/26 = 1/26 - 1/72 = 1/72

So, the wholesaler has 1/72 of the original amount of olive oil.

Therefore, the wholesaler has 1/72 of 41/26 = 41/26 - 1/72 = 35/26 barrels of olive oil left in their warehouse.</pre>

To see why, we can add the two fractions together:

12/33 + 49/2 = (12 + 49)/33 = 61/33

So the result is 61/33, which is equal to 62 over 33.</pre>

            What is the result of adding two fractions, where each fraction is 78/65?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To add two fractions, you need to find the common denominator and then add the numerators.

In this case, the common denominator is 65.

So, the first fraction is 78/65 and the second fraction is also 78/65.

To add them, you need to find the sum of the numerators:

78 + 78 = 156

The sum of the numerators is 156.

Now, you need to find the common denominator:

65 + 65 = 130

The common denominator is 130.

So, the sum of the two fractions is 156/130.
