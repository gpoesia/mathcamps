        A jeweler has 4 diamond rings. One of the diamond rings was purchased and the customer had a 3 gem discount but decided to add 2 gems later. The jeweler had to make adjustments according to the customer's request. How many rings would he have left after these adjustments?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  The jeweler had 4 diamond rings to start with.

One of the diamond rings was purchased, so he had 3 diamond rings left.

The customer had a 3 gem discount, so he had 3/4 = &lt;&lt;3/4=0.75&gt;&gt;75% of the original 4 diamond rings left.

The customer decided to add 2 gems to the ring, so he had 0.75 x 1.25 = &lt;&lt;0.75\*1.25=0.9375&gt;&gt;93.75% of the original 4 diamond rings left.

Therefore, the jeweler would have 0.9375 x 4 = &lt;&lt;0.9375\*4=3.875&gt;&gt;3.875 diamond rings left after these adjustments.</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's break this down step by step:

1. Jacob set his watch 2 hours ahead, so the time on his watch is 2 hours ahead of the actual time.
2. When he woke up, he adjusted his watch 3 more hours ahead, so the time on his watch is now 5 hours ahead of the actual time.
3. Later, Jacob realized his watch was running too fast, so he set it 4 hours backward.

Now, let's find the final time difference on Jacob's watch from the actual time:

The actual time is 12:00 PM (noon).
The time on Jacob's watch is 8:00 PM (5 hours ahead of the actual time).

So, the final time difference on Jacob's watch from the actual time is 4 hours (8:00 PM - 12:00 PM = 4 hours).</pre>

        A doctor had 3 patients in the morning, then sees 2 patients leave after their check-ups.

How many patients does the doctor have in the afternoon after the decline?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

In the morning, the doctor had 3 patients.

After the check-ups, 2 patients left, so the doctor had 3 - 2 = &lt;&lt;3-2=1&gt;&gt;1 patient left.

In the afternoon, the doctor started off with 5 patients.

The number of patients the doctor had in the morning was 1, so the number of patients he had left from the morning was 5 - 1 = &lt;&lt;5-1=4&gt;&gt;4 patients.

Therefore, the doctor had 5 - 4 = &lt;&lt;5-4=1&gt;&gt;1 patient in the afternoon after the decline.

She gave away the total number of carrots that she had eaten for breakfast and lunch, so we can subtract the number of carrots she ate for breakfast and lunch from the total number of carrots she had.

Alice ate 2 carrots for breakfast, so she gave away 2 carrots.
Alice ate 1 carrot for lunch, so she gave away 1 carrot.

The total number of carrots that Alice gave away is 2 + 1 = 3.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  The unicorn starts with 5 magic crystals.

* It loses 3 of them while crossing a tumultuous river, so it has 5 - 3 = &lt;&lt;5-3=2&gt;&gt;2 magic crystals left.
