We know that Miny started with 1 magical stone, so she has a total of 1 + b magical stones.

After the party, Miny collected 2 more stones, so she now has a total of 1 + b + 2 = 1 + b + 2 magical stones.

Therefore, Miny has a total of 1 + b + 2 = 1 + b + 2 magical stones.

We know that the wizard has 7 potions in his pantry to start with, so we can write an equation based on this information:

x + 13 = 7

To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

x + 13 - 7 = x

This simplifies to:

x + 6 = 0

Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = -6

So, the wizard has -6 potions now.</pre>

Then, Larry gives George an additional amount of paint that is equivalent to what George originally had. This means that George now has 2g + (2g/2) = 2g + 1g = 3g of paint.

Finally, George buys 4 more gallons of paint, so he now has 3g + 4g = 7g of paint in total.

Therefore, the answer is 7g.</pre>
