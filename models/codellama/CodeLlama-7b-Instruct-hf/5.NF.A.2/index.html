            In their game, Kyle threw a ball for a distance of 18/4 yards, while Lisa threw the same ball for a distance of 19/9 yards. How many yards did the ball travel in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total distance traveled by the ball, we need to find the ratio of the distances traveled by Kyle and Lisa.

Let's say the ratio of the distances traveled by Kyle and Lisa is x. Then, we can write:

18/4 = x \* 19/9

Simplifying the equation, we get:

18 = x \* 19

Now, we can divide both sides by 19 to solve for x:

x = 18/19

So, the ratio of the distances traveled by Kyle and Lisa is 18/19.

Now, we can find the total distance traveled by the ball by multiplying the ratio by the total distance:

Total distance = Ratio \* Total distance
Total distance = 18/19 \* (18/4 + 19/9)
Total distance = 18/19 \* 21/4
Total distance = 18/19 \* 5
Total distance = 9

Therefore, the ball traveled a total distance of 9 yards.</pre>

We know that Sam's binoculars increase his range of sight by 3/14 of a mile, so his range increase is 3/14 of a mile.

We also know that Joe's binoculars increase his range of sight by exactly 1 mile, so his range increase is 1 mile.

When Sam and Joe use their binoculars one after the other, the combined range increase is the sum of their individual range increases, which is:

3/14 of a mile + 1 mile = 17/14 of a mile

So, the combined range increase when Sam and Joe use their binoculars one after the other is 17/14 of a mile.</pre>

            A jeweler has 5/14 pound of silver and adds 18/19 pounds more to the supply. How many pounds of silver does the jeweler have now to make rings?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  The jeweler has 5/14 pounds of silver to start with.

To add 18/19 pounds more to the supply, we can multiply the number of pounds by the fraction:

18/19 pounds = 18/19 \* 14/14 = 18/19 \* 1 = 18/19

So the jeweler now has 5/14 + 18/19 = 23/19 pounds of silver.

To make rings, the jeweler needs to cut the silver into thin strips, which we'll call &quot;rings.&quot; Each ring is 1/19 of a pound, so the jeweler can make:

23/19 pounds / 1/19 pound per ring = 23/19 rings

Therefore, the jeweler can make 23/19 rings.</pre>

The time it takes to build the frame is 5/3 hours, so that's 5/3 hours.

The time it takes to upholster the chair is 10/13 hours, so that's 10/13 hours.

To add these two times together, we can use the formula:

Total time = time to build the frame + time to upholster the chair

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

Total time = 5/3 hours + 10/13 hours

Simplifying, we get:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total words per second typed by Jim and Mary, we need to divide the total number of words typed by the total time taken to type those words.

Jim typed 20 words in 16 seconds, so the total number of words typed by Jim is 20.
Mary typed 9 words in 4 seconds, so the total number of words typed by Mary is 9.

The total time taken to type the words by Jim is 16 seconds, and the total time taken to type the words by Mary is 4 seconds.

To find the total words per second typed by Jim, we can divide the total number of words typed by the total time taken to type those words:

20 words / 16 seconds = 1.25 words per second (Jim)

To find the total words per second typed by Mary, we can divide the total number of words typed by the total time taken to type those words:

9 words / 4 seconds = 2.25 words per second (Mary)

7/10 miles = 3/5 miles

So, the hammerhead shark swam for 3/5 miles.

Now, let's find the total distance swam by both the blue shark and the hammerhead shark:

1/2 miles + 3/5 miles = 5/10 miles

So, both the blue shark and the hammerhead shark swam for 5/10 miles together.</pre>

First, let's convert the fractions to decimals:

9/4 = 2.25

Now, let's add the weights of the two types of meat together:

1.03 + 2.25 = 3.28

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the relative brightness of both stars, we need to find the ratio of their brightness to an average star.

Let's call the relative brightness of Alpha as x/17 and the relative brightness of Bravo as y/20.

We know that Alpha shines 17/3 times brighter than an average star, so we can write:

x/17 = 17/3

Similarly, we can write:

y/20 = 20/16

Now, we can add these two equations to find the ratio of the brightness of both stars to an average star:

(x/17) + (y/20) = (17/3) + (20/16)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x/17 + y/20 = 19/30

Now, we can find the relative brightness of both stars by multiplying their relative brightness by 30:

x = 17 \* 30 = 510

y = 20 \* 30 = 600

So, the relative brightness of Alpha is 510/30 = 17.33 times brighter than an average star, and the relative brightness of Bravo is 600/30 = 20 times brighter than an average star.

Therefore, if we add up the relative brightness of both stars, we get:

17.33 + 20 = 37.33

So, both stars are 37.33 times brighter than an average star.</pre>

To find the total number of kilograms of apples in the store, we need to add the number of kilograms of red apples to the number of kilograms of green apples.

17/20 kg of red apples = 17/20 kg
18/8 kg of green apples = 18/8 kg

Adding these two quantities gives us a total of:

17/20 kg + 18/8 kg = 35/10 kg

Therefore, there are 35/10 kg of apples in the store in total.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  If a bus drives 12/20 of a mile, it means it has traveled 12/20 of a mile, or 6/20 of a mile.

If it then goes an additional 12/12 of a mile, it means it has traveled 12/12 of a mile, or 1 mile.

Therefore, the bus has traveled a total of 6/20 + 1 = 7/20 of a mile.

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 20:

7/20 = 0.35

So the bus has traveled 0.35 miles in total.</pre>
