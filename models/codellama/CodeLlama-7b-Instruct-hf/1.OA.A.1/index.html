Let's analyze the situation:

1. The UFO displayed a sequence of 18 lights.
2. 12 of those lights were a ruse and only functioned as a distraction.
3. Therefore, the number of significant lights displayed by the UFO is 18 - 12 = 6.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  There are 8 lions at the zoo, but 7 have been moved to a different zoo. The number of tigers at the zoo is this new lion count plus 10.

Let's call the new lion count &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the number of tigers at the zoo is x + 10.

We also know that the number of lions at the zoo is 8 - 7 = 1.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 1 + x

Simplifying the equation:

x + 10 = 2x

Solving for x:

x = 10

So, there are 10 tigers at the zoo.</pre>
