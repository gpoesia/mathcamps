        <pre class="model-raw-response">  There are 10 books on the shelf, and 4 of them are fantasy novels. This means that 6 books are not fantasy novels.

If 6 books are not fantasy novels, then 6/10 = &lt;&lt;6/10=0.60&gt;&gt;60% of the books are not fantasy novels.

Since 4 books are fantasy novels, 4/10 = &lt;&lt;4/10=0.40&gt;&gt;40% of the books are fantasy novels.

Therefore, 60% of the books are not fantasy novels, and 40% of the books are fantasy novels.

We know that the snowman requires 10 lbs of snow for its bottom half, so we can set up the equation:

x + y = 10

where &quot;y&quot; is the additional weight of snow added to the bottom half.

We also know that the snowman was initially built with 9 lbs of snow, so we can set up the equation:

x = 9

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for &quot;y&quot; by subtracting the first equation from the second:

y = 10 - 9 = 1

So 1 lb of snow was added to the bottom half of the snowman.</pre>

We know that Jonny had x candies with him, and his mom gave him 10 more candies. So, the total number of candies Jonny has now is x + 10 = 14.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

Now, we need to solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 4

            John has a guitar with 10 strings. Some of the strings broke, but you know that being left with (e + 6) strings meant the guitar still had 10 strings. What is the value of e, i.e., how many strings were broken?

We know that the guitar had 10 strings before the breakage, and after the breakage, it had (e + 6) strings. Since the guitar still had 10 strings, we can set up the equation:

10 - e + 6 = 10

Simplifying the equation:

5 - e = 0

e = 5

Therefore, 5 strings were broken.</pre>

Let x be the number of students who came on the bus at the second stop.

We know that the total number of students on the bus at the second stop is 14.

So, we can write the equation:

x + 10 = 14

We also know that the number of students on the bus at the first stop is 10.

So, we can write the equation:

x + 10 = 24

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of x.

Solving the equations, we get:

x = 4

So, 4 students came on the bus at the second stop.</pre>

            A color palette consists of 10 colors in total. It starts with 8 base colors and some additional colors are added. If the total number of colors remains 10, how many additional colors were added to the 8 base colors palette?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the number of additional colors added &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the total number of colors in the palette is 10, so the sum of the number of base colors and the number of additional colors must be equal to 10:

8 + x = 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2

Therefore, 2 additional colors were added to the 8 base colors palette.</pre>

Let x be the number of beach balls added at the party.

We know that the total number of beach balls at the party is 13, which means that the number of beach balls already present (10) plus the number of beach balls added (x) is equal to 13.

10 + x = 13

We also know that the number of beach balls added is equal to the difference between the total number of beach balls at the party and the number of beach balls already present.

x = 13 - 10

x = 3

Therefore, 3 more beach balls were added at the party.</pre>

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the information given in the problem to create a story.

Eli has 10 toy cars in the sandbox. He looks around and sees 10 toy cars. He then finds 11 toy cars in the sandbox. This means that there is one toy car that Eli did not initially see.

Let's call the number of toy cars that Eli did not initially see &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the total number of toy cars in the sandbox is 10 + x.

We also know that the total number of toy cars that Eli found in the sandbox is 11.

So, we can set up the equation:

10 + x = 11

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1

So, there is one toy car that Eli did not initially see.</pre>
