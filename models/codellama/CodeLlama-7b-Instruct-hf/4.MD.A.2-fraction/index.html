            Steve started with 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days. Then he received an extra 11 dollars. John started with 18 dollars but then he spent the same amount of money as Steve had. John found 25 dollars on the street. How much money does John have now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Steve started with $38 and spent it evenly over 8 days, so he spent $38/8 = $4.50 per day. He spent a total of $4.50 x 8 = $36.00.

Then he received an extra $11, so he now has $36.00 + $11 = $47.00.

John started with $18 and spent the same amount of money as Steve had, so he spent $18/8 = $2.12 per day. He spent a total of $2.12 x 8 = $17.28.

Then he found $25, so he now has $17.28 + $25 = $42.28.

He finds a loose change on his desk that amounts to $8/37.

The loose change is $8/37 of the total amount of $37.

1. Initially, Sally traveled 47/50 of a mile, which is 47/50 of 1 mile = 0.94 miles.
2. After gaining confidence, she rode an additional 31 miles.
3. Every day for the next 28 days, she completed the same distance, which is 31 miles.
4. After adding the extra 32/24 miles to her regular bike route, she traveled a total of 31 + (32/24) = 31 + 1.5 = 32.5 miles.

Therefore, the total distance traveled by Sally after adding the extra traveling distance is 32.5 miles.

Distance = 184 miles

Therefore, the train travels 184 miles in 4 hours.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's first calculate the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel.

The truck can travel a distance of 34/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel.

If 11 more kilometers are added to the journey, the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel would be:

34/25 kilometers + 11 kilometers = 45/25 kilometers

So, the truck can travel 45/25 kilometers before running out of fuel.

Now, let's calculate the total distance the truck can travel after adding an additional 49 kilometers to the journey.

The truck can travel a distance of 34/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel.

If 49 more kilometers are added to the journey, the total distance the truck can travel would be:

34/25 kilometers + 49 kilometers = 73/25 kilometers

So, the truck can travel 73/25 kilometers after adding an additional 49 kilometers to the journey.</pre>

            John drank a special energy drink that increased his jogging speed. After the energy drink, he was able to jog 50/49 miles per hour faster. One day, he had a speed of 4/22 miles per hour without the use of the energy drink. After consuming the energy drink, at what rate would he jog if he continued for 46/30 hours?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that John was able to jog 50/49 miles per hour faster after consuming the energy drink. This means that if he was jogging at a speed of 4/22 miles per hour without the energy drink, he would be able to jog at a speed of 4/22 + 50/49 = 44/22 miles per hour with the energy drink.

Now, we know that John continued to jog for 46/30 hours after consuming the energy drink. To find out how fast he was jogging during this time, we can multiply the number of hours he jogged by the speed he was able to achieve with the energy drink:

46/30 hours x 44/22 miles per hour = 196/110 miles per hour

Therefore, if John continued to jog for 46/30 hours after consuming the energy drink, he would be able to jog at a speed of 196/110 miles per hour.</pre>

Samantha has $28 in her bank account.
She found 46/41 dollars in coins on the street.
46/41 dollars = 1.15 dollars

So, she added 1.15 dollars to her savings.

Now, Samantha has $28 + 1.15 = 29.15 dollars in her bank account.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that Roberto has 50 ounces of juice.

Roberto splits the juice into 17 equal parts, so each part has 50/17 = &lt;&lt;50/17=2.94&gt;&gt;2.94 ounces of juice.

Roberto takes the juice from one part and pours it into a container. Let's call the amount of juice in that container &quot;x&quot;.

Roberto then takes 34/44 of what is in that container and pours it into another container. Let's call the amount of juice in the second container &quot;y&quot;.

We know that x + y = 34/44, since Roberto took 34/44 of what was in the first container and poured it into the second container.

We also know that x = 2.94, since Roberto split the juice into 17 equal parts and each part had 2.94 ounces of juice.

Now we can solve for y:

y = 34/44 - x
y = 34/44 - 2.94
y = 11.06

So the amount of juice in the second container is 11.06 ounces.</pre>

The second part of the race is run at a speed of 21 miles per 26 hours, so the average speed for this part of the race is:

21 miles / 26 hours = 0.8 miles per hour

The total average speed of the race is the average of the two speeds:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the distance traveled by Jenny, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

We know that Jenny drove for a total of 29 hours at a speed of 32/24 miles per hour. We can convert the speed to miles per hour by multiplying by 24:

Speed = 32/24 x 24 = 32 miles per hour

We can then use the formula to find the distance traveled:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 32 miles per hour x 29 hours
= 928 miles

Now, if Jenny's speed increases by a factor of 43/15, we can find the new speed by multiplying the old speed by the factor:

New Speed = Old Speed x (43/15)
= 32 miles per hour x (43/15)
= 32 x 43/15
= 43 miles per hour

We can then use the formula to find the new distance traveled:

New Distance = New Speed x Time
= 43 miles per hour x 29 hours
= 1187 miles

Therefore, if Jenny's speed increases by a factor of 43/15, she could travel 1187 miles in 29 hours.</pre>

1. For the first rock, the distance moved is:

20/50 hours x 25/22 miles/hour = 20/50 x 25/22 = 1/2 mile

2. For the second rock, the distance moved is:

45/36 hours x 25/22 miles/hour = 45/36 x 25/22 = 3/4 mile

Now, let's add the distance moved by both rocks:

1 mile + 3/4 mile = 5/4 mile

Therefore, Tom moved a total distance of 5/4 miles today.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by writing down the information given in the problem:

* The scientist mixed 10/42 liters of solution A and 32 liters of solution B to create a mixture.
* She then removed 4/28 liters from this mixture.
* If she then decided to extract 11/29 of the remaining mixture for an experiment, how much solution is she using for her experiment?

We can start by calculating the total volume of the mixture:

10/42 + 32 = 42/42 + 32 = 74 liters

Now, we can calculate the volume of the mixture after removing 4/28 liters:

74 - 4/28 = 74 - 1/7 = 73 liters

Next, we can calculate the volume of the remaining mixture after extracting 11/29 of it:

73 x 11/29 = 73 x 4/7 = 29.4 liters

So, the scientist is using 29.4 liters of the mixture for her experiment.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The first container contains 23/35 gallon of juice, which is equal to 23/35 x 12 = 8 gallons.
The second container contains 50/41 gallon of juice, which is equal to 50/41 x 12 = 10 gallons.

After mixing the two containers of juice together, the total amount of juice is 8 + 10 = 18 gallons.

The customer drank 11/19 gallon of juice, which is equal to 11/19 x 12 = 6 gallons.

Therefore, the amount of space left in the bottle after subtracting 6 gallons is 18 - 6 = 12 gallons.

$13/10 + $47/36 = $50/36

Now, let's multiply the total amount of money by 43:

$50/36 x 43 = $2100/36

33/48 = 0.6875

So, Richard drank 0.6875 liters of wine.

Now, let's find the volume of the orange juice that Richard drank:

26/30 = 0.8667

So, Richard drank 0.8667 liters of orange juice.

Finally, let's find the volume of the water that Richard drank:

2/36 = 0.0556

So, Richard drank 0.0556 liters of water.

Now, let's add up the total volume of the liquid that Richard consumed:

0.6875 + 0.8667 + 0.0556 = 1.5858 liters

Therefore, the total volume of the liquid that Richard consumed is 1.5858 liters.</pre>

Let's start by converting the number of apples to a more manageable unit, such as the number of apples per week.

17 pounds of apples / 4 weeks = 4.25 pounds of apples per week

Now, let's convert the number of apple juice containers to a more manageable unit, such as the number of apple juice containers per week.

42 days / 4 weeks = 10 days per week

10 days / 42 days = 0.24 weeks per apple juice container

Now, let's find the ratio of the number of apples to the number of apple juice containers.

4.25 pounds of apples per week / 0.24 weeks per apple juice container = 17.5 apples per apple juice container

Therefore, John consumes 17.5 apples per apple juice container.</pre>

Maria drove her car for 8 hours, so she drove for a total of 8 hours x 4/7 miles per hour = 8 x 4/7 = 32 miles.

Now, let's find the remaining amount of money Maria had for gas.

Maria initially had 38 dollars for gas, but she spent 50/4 dollars on gas. So, she spent 50/4 dollars on gas, which is 12.5 dollars.

The remaining amount of money Maria had for gas is 38 dollars - 12.5 dollars = 25.5 dollars.

2. Then, John took a bus for another 30/12 hours, which means he traveled for 30/12 hours = 30/12 \* 60 minutes/hour = 30/12 \* 3600 seconds/hour = 108,000 seconds.
3. After taking a short break of 17/4 hours, John was on the move for a total of 54 seconds + 108,000 seconds = 108,544 seconds.

Clara had 30 dollars initially.
She spent 25/6 dollars on ice cream, which is equal to 25/6 \* 6 = 15 dollars.
After buying the ice cream, she used 11/21 of her remaining money to buy a book.
She used 11/21 of 15 = 11/21 \* 15 = 6 dollars on the book.

Therefore, Clara spent 6 dollars on the book.

Now, we know that Walter still has 46 dollars left after buying the pen. This means that he spent 23 dollars on the pen, which is 23/44 of the total cost of the pen.

The total tonnage of the cargo on the ship is equal to the total weight of the cargo divided by the density of the cargo.

The density of the cargo is given as 17/26 tons per container.

Therefore, the total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after it loads all 39 containers is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  James has 19 dollars in his account.
He earns 49/44 dollars per hour working online.

To find out how many dollars James has in his account after working for an hour, we need to multiply the number of hours he works by the amount he earns per hour.

1 hour = 49/44 dollars

So, James works for 1 hour and earns 49/44 dollars.

1 hour x 49/44 dollars = 49/44 dollars

Therefore, James has 49/44 dollars in his account after working for an hour.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            You have $15 in your savings account. You decided to spend 17/23 of a dollar on a small sweet. How much is left in your savings account after buying the sweet?
        </p>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

You have $15 in your savings account.
You decided to spend 17/23 of a dollar on a small sweet.

17/23 of a dollar = 0.73 dollars

You spent 0.73 dollars on the sweet.

$15 - 0.73 = $14.27

Therefore, there are $14.27 left in your savings account after buying the sweet.

### Answer: $14.27</pre>
