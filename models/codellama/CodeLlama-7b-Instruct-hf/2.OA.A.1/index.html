We know that he spends 7 hours working on the puzzle in April and an additional amount of time 'b' to finish it completely. So, the total time he spends on the puzzle is 7 + b.

We also know that he spends 13 hours working on the puzzle altogether. So, we can set up the equation:

7 + b = 13

To find the value of b, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

b = 13 - 7

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the number of building blocks that Jack initially had &quot;x&quot;.

We know that Jack lost 64 building blocks, so he now has 24 - 64 = &lt;&lt;24-64=-36&gt;&gt;36 building blocks left.

We also know that Jack initially had x building blocks, so he had a total of x + 36 = &lt;&lt;x+36=x-36&gt;&gt;x - 36 building blocks.

We are given that Jack now has 24 building blocks, so we can set up the equation:

x - 36 = 24

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the information given in the problem to create an equation. We know that the store had 25 jackets in stock initially, and after selling some of them, they only have 11 left. This means that the number of jackets that were sold is equal to the number of jackets that were left after they sold some of them.

We can write this equation:

25 - x = 11

where x is the number of jackets that were sold.

To solve for x, we can add 25 to both sides of the equation:

25 - x + 25 = 11 + 25

This simplifies to:

x = 14

So, 14 jackets were sold.</pre>

        A music album has a total of 40 songs. If you subtract the number of romantic songs from the total, you have 20 songs left. How many romantic songs are in the album?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the number of romantic songs &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the total number of songs in the album is 40.

We also know that the number of romantic songs is 20, so we can set up the equation:

x + (40 - x) = 40

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 20 = 40

Subtracting 20 from both sides:

2x = 20

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 10

So, there are 10 romantic songs in the album.</pre>

        A camping accessories shop starts with 'a' number of sleeping bags. After selling 36 of them, they are only left with 35. What was the original number of sleeping bags in the shop?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the original number of sleeping bags &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the shop started with &quot;a&quot; number of sleeping bags, which means &quot;a&quot; = x.

We also know that the shop sold 36 sleeping bags, so we can write an equation:

a - 36 = 35

Now, we need to solve for &quot;a&quot;. We can do this by adding 36 to both sides of the equation:

a + 36 = 35 + 36

This simplifies to:

a = 72

So, the original number of sleeping bags in the shop was 72.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the number of flowers the gardener originally planted &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the gardener removed 30 flowers, so the number of flowers he is left with is 58 - 30 = 28.

We also know that the number of flowers the gardener originally planted is greater than the number of flowers he is left with, so we can set up the equation:

x &gt; 28

We can solve for &quot;x&quot; by subtracting 28 from both sides of the equation:

x - 28 &gt; 0

To solve for 'k', we can subtract 97 from both sides of the equation:

        You had a certain number of strawberries, represented by 'j'. After eating 43 of them, you're left with just 13 strawberries. How many strawberries did you initially have?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the number of strawberries you initially had 'j'.

You had j strawberries and ate 43 of them, so you have j - 43 = &lt;&lt;j-43=j-43&gt;&gt;j - 43 strawberries left.

You then ate 13 more strawberries, so you have j - 43 - 13 = &lt;&lt;j-43-13=j-56&gt;&gt;j - 56 strawberries left.

Since you have 13 strawberries left, you must have had j - 56 + 13 = &lt;&lt;j-56+13=j-43&gt;&gt;j - 43 strawberries initially.

Therefore, the number of strawberries you initially had is j = 43.</pre>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's say the initial number of students on the school bus is x.

We know that 17 students have alighted from the bus, so the new number of students seated is x - 17.

We also know that there are 56 students still seated, so the new number of students seated is x - 17 + 56.

We can simplify this equation by combining the like terms:

x - 17 + 56 = x + 40

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

17 = 40

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

8.5 = 20

This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that the initial number of students on the school bus is x must be false. Therefore, there were no students initially on the school bus.

We also know that the farmer harvested 57 oranges from one tree, so we can write another equation:

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for &quot;x&quot; by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

        A hat shop initially has a total of (z) hats. After selling 27 hats, there were 25 hats left in the store. How many hats did the store initially have?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's say the initial number of hats is x.

We know that the store had 27 hats initially, so we can write an equation based on that:

x + 27 = 25

We also know that the store had 25 hats left after selling 27 hats, so we can write another equation based on that:

25 = 27 - x

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for x by adding the two equations:

x + 27 = 25
27 - x = 25

Adding the two equations, we get:

27 + 27 = 54
54 = 25

Solving for x, we get:

27 + 27 = 54
54 = 25

x = 27

So the store initially had 27 hats.</pre>

where &quot;27&quot; is the number of gallons of milk that the farmer had left after the sale.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the number of sunglasses for women &quot;w&quot; and the number of sunglasses for men &quot;m&quot;.

We know that the total number of sunglasses in the store is 87, and 40 of them are for women. So, we can write an equation:

w + m = 87

We also know that 40 is half of 87, so we can write another equation:

w = 87/2 = 43

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of w and m:

w + m = 87
w = 43

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

43 + m = 87
m = 44

So, there are 44 sunglasses for men in the store.</pre>
