Oliver gave 19 bones to his friend, so he is left with x - 19 = &lt;&lt;x-19=x-19&gt;&gt;x - 19 bones.

Since he is left with only 1 bone, we can set up the equation:

x = 20

Let x be the number of trains that have already departed during the day.

We know that 15 trains are left to depart, so the total number of trains that have departed is 15 + x.

We also know that the total number of trains scheduled for departure is 17, so we can set up the equation:

15 + x = 17

Solving for x, we get:

x = 17 - 15
x = 2

We know that Billy already had 4 items in his backpack, so the total number of items in his backpack before he started packing was 4.

By the time he stopped packing, there were 10 items in his backpack. So, the total number of items in his backpack after he stopped packing was 10 + 4 = 14.

Now, let's set up the equation:

We know that the number of students on the bus at the start of the morning was 14.

We also know that the number of students on the bus after dropping off some students was 7.

So, we can set up the equation:

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

14 - x + x = 7 + x

Combine like terms:

Subtract 7 from both sides:

We know that the designer sold 13 of them, so the number of blue dresses left in stock is x - 13.

We also know that there are only 2 blue dresses left in stock, so we can set up the equation:

x - 13 = 2

To solve for x, we can add 13 to both sides of the equation:

x = 13 + 2

x = 15

At the beginning of the day, the desk drawer had 6 pens.
At the end of the day, the desk drawer had 6 + x pens, where x is the number of pens dropped off by office workers.

We know that the total number of pens in the drawer at the end of the day is 12, so we can set up the equation:

6 + x = 12

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 12 - 6
x = 6

Therefore, 6 pens were dropped off by office workers throughout the day.</pre>

At the start of the day, you had 18 guitars in stock, and the customer bought x guitars. So, you had 18 - x guitars left in stock.

By the end of the day, you had 16 guitars left in stock, which means you had x - 16 guitars left in stock.

We know that x - 16 = 16, so we can set up the equation:

x - 16 = 16

Adding 16 to both sides of the equation, we get:

Reasoning:

* The band prepared 11 songs to perform at the concert.
* They only managed to perform 7 songs due to technical problems.
* Therefore, the band was not able to perform 11 - 7 = 4 songs at the concert.</pre>

            A snowman has a certain number of snowballs stacked to form its shape. If 7 snowballs are removed, only 11 snowballs remain. How many snowballs were used to build the snowman originally?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the original number of snowballs used to build the snowman &quot;x&quot;.

We know that 7 snowballs were removed, so the new number of snowballs remaining is 11.

We can set up the equation:

x - 7 = 11

To solve for x, we can add 7 to both sides of the equation:

x = 11 + 7

x = 18

So, the original number of snowballs used to build the snowman was 18.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  There were 10 mermaids at the beginning, and after a while, there were 20 mermaids. To find out how many new mermaids joined the kingdom, we need to subtract the original number of mermaids from the new number of mermaids.
