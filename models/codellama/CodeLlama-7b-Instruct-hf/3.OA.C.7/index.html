        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's say each plot received x seeds. Then, the total number of seeds used is 80, which is the number of flower seeds Theresa planted evenly among 10 plots.

Since Theresa planted an extra plot with the same amount of seeds as in each of the previous plots, the total number of seeds used for all 11 plots is 80 + 11x = 80 + 11\*x.

To find out how many seeds Theresa used for the extra plot, we can set up the equation:

80 + 11x = 72

Solving for x, we get:

11x = 72 - 80

x = 72 - 80 / 11

x = 72 - 7

x = 65

Therefore, Theresa used 65 seeds for the extra plot.</pre>

Since Green Gauntlet has the ability to multiply his strength by a factor of 3, we can write:

S x 3 = Jetstream's strength

We know that Jetstream has 5 times the strength of Green Gauntlet, so we can write:

S x 3 = 5S

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3S = 5S

Subtracting 3S from both sides gives us:

S = 2S

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

S = 1

Therefore, the strength of Jetstream is 1.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many yards of yarn are needed to create one blanket, we need to first find out how many sections are required to make one blanket.

Each finished blanket is made up of 5 sections, so we can start by multiplying 5 by 6 to find out how many yards of yarn are required for one section:

5 x 6 = 30 yards of yarn

Now, we need to find out how many sections are required to make one blanket. Since each blanket is made up of 5 sections, we can multiply 5 by 5 to find out how many sections are required to make one blanket:

5 x 5 = 25 sections

Now, we can multiply the number of sections required to make one blanket by the number of yards of yarn required for one section to find out how many yards of yarn are needed to create one blanket:

25 x 30 = 750 yards of yarn

Therefore, we need 750 yards of yarn to create one blanket.</pre>

The formula is:

height = sqrt(radius^2 + (height/2)^2)

In this case, the radius of the bike wheel is 81/9 units, so we can plug that value in for the radius.

height = sqrt((81/9)^2 + ((height/2)/9)^2)

We are given that the height of the signpost is 9 times the radius of the bike wheel, so we can plug that value in for the height.

height = sqrt((81/9)^2 + ((9\*81/9)/9)^2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

height = sqrt((81/9)^2 + (81/81)^2)

height = sqrt(1 + 1)

height = sqrt(2)

Therefore, the height of the signpost is 2 units.</pre>

            In a circus, a tightrope is set 10 feet off the ground. A stuntman wants to do a daring stunt - he wants to walk from one side of the tightrope to the other. The tightrope is five times the height above the ground. What distance will he need to walk to complete his stunt?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the distance the stuntman will need to walk, we can use the formula for the height of a triangle:

Height = (base \* height) / 2

In this case, the base of the triangle is the distance between the two sides of the tightrope, which is 10 feet. The height of the triangle is the distance from the ground to the top of the tightrope, which is 5 times the height above the ground.

So, we can set up the equation:

Height = (10 \* 5) / 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Height = 50 / 2

Height = 25

Therefore, the stuntman will need to walk 25 feet to complete his stunt.</pre>

Each bracelet requires 12 beads, so we can multiply the number of bracelets by the number of beads required per bracelet to find the total number of beads needed:

12 beads/bracelet x 8 bracelets = 8 x 12 = 96 beads

Therefore, Jenna will need 96 beads in total to make all 8 bracelets.</pre>

First, let's convert the amount of toothpaste in milliliters to the equivalent amount in liters:

66 mL = 0.066 L

Next, let's divide the total amount of toothpaste in the tube by the amount of toothpaste used for each brushing:

0.066 L Ã· 11 mL = 0.060 L

Now, we can convert the result from liters to the equivalent number of brushings:

0.060 L Ã· 11 mL = 0.055 brushings

Therefore, Penny can brush her teeth with the new tube of toothpaste 0.055 times.</pre>

            A candle burns out at a rate of 2 hours per inch. If a candle is 3 inches tall, how long will it take for the candle to burn out completely?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the time it will take for the candle to burn out completely, we need to multiply the rate at which the candle is burning out by the height of the candle.

Rate of burning out = 2 hours/inch
Height of candle = 3 inches

Time = Rate x Height
Time = 2 hours/inch x 3 inches
Time = 6 hours

Therefore, it will take 6 hours for the candle to burn out completely.</pre>

            Following from the previous problems, let's consider a new scenario. This time, suppose Charlie only had 2 chocolates and again decided to share half of them with his sister. Then, he counts his remaining chocolates and decides to double the amount. How many chocolates does Charlie have now in this scenario?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  In this scenario, Charlie has 2 chocolates.
He shares half of them with his sister, so he has 2/2 = &lt;&lt;2/2=1&gt;&gt;1 chocolate left.
He then doubles the amount, so he has 1 x 2 = &lt;&lt;1*2=2&gt;&gt;2 chocolates now.
Therefore, Charlie has 2 chocolates now.</pre>
