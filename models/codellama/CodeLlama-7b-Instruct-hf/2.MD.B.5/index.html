3. Later, she buys an additional 19 meters of string, so she has 11 + 19 = &lt;&lt;11+19=20&gt;&gt;20 meters of string in total.

Therefore, Mia has 20 meters of string in total.

We also know that the length of the shorter side is 16 feet shorter than the longer side, so we can write another equation based on that:

We know that the remaining length of the ribbon is 56 centimeters shorter than the original length, so the remaining length is:

x - 56 cm

We also know that the ribbon was originally 81 cm long, so we can set up the equation:

x - 56 cm = 81 cm

To solve for x, we can add 56 cm to both sides of the equation:

x = 81 cm + 56 cm

x = 137 cm

The gardener has already covered 36 meters of the path with gravel.

To find out how many meters are still left to be covered with gravel, we need to subtract the length of the path that has already been covered by the gravel from the total length of the path:

68 - 36 = 32

Therefore, there are 32 meters still left to be covered with gravel.</pre>

We know that his neighbor lives 19 feet away from the local park.

So, we can set up the equation:

49 - 19 = x

Where x is the number of feet away from the local park that Brett's house is.

Solving for x, we get:

49 - 19 = 30

So, Brett's house is 30 feet away from the local park.</pre>

            John is competing in a triathlon. The swimming portion is 59 minutes long, but he finishes it 37 minutes. Then he starts the bike portion which is 58 minutes long, but he wants to finish it even faster than he did the swimming portion. How long does John have to finish the bike portion to achieve his goal?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the time it takes John to finish the swimming portion &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the swimming portion is 59 minutes long, so we can write an equation based on that:

x + 58 = 59

We also know that John wants to finish the bike portion even faster than he did the swimming portion, so we can write another equation based on that:

x &lt; 37

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for &quot;x&quot; by subtracting the second equation from the first:

x + 58 - 37 = 59 - 37

This simplifies to:

x = 21

So John has 21 minutes to finish the bike portion.</pre>

1. Initial row: 85 feet
2. Removed section: 58 feet
3. New row: 56 feet

To find the total length of the planted bushes, we need to add the length of the initial row, the length of the removed section, and the length of the new row.

85 feet + 58 feet - 56 feet = 93 feet

Therefore, the total length of the planted bushes once George adds the new row will be 93 feet.</pre>
