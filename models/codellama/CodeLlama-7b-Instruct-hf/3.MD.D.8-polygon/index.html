            A regular pentagon has side lengths of 70cm, 36cm, 53cm, and 45cm. If the total perimeter of the pentagon is 300cm, what is the length of its fifth side?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the formula for the perimeter of a regular polygon, which is:

P = n \* s

where P is the perimeter, n is the number of sides, and s is the length of one side.

In this case, we know that the perimeter is 300cm, and we can set up the equation:

300 = 5 \* s

where 5 is the number of sides of the pentagon.

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a regular polygon is 360 degrees to find the length of one side. The sum of the angles in a regular polygon is given by:

180 + (n-2) \* 180

where n is the number of sides.

In this case, we know that the number of sides is 5, so we can set up the equation:

180 + (5-2) \* 180 = 180 + 3 \* 180 = 180 + 540 = 720

Now, we can solve for s:

s = P / n

Substituting the values we know, we get:

s = 300 / 5

s = 60cm

So, the length of the fifth side of the pentagon is 60cm.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the length of the ninth side, we can use the fact that the perimeter of a regular nonagon is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

Perimeter = 14 + 94 + 3 + 20 + 57 + 83 + 96 + 85 = 521

Since the perimeter is given as 521, we can set up the equation:

14 + 94 + 3 + 20 + 57 + 83 + 96 + 85 = 521

Simplifying the equation, we get:

356 = 521

Subtracting 356 from both sides gives us:

-165 = -356

Dividing both sides by -165 gives us:

9/165 = 1/2

Multiplying both sides by 165 gives us:

9 = 165

Therefore, the length of the ninth side is 165.</pre>

So, we can set up the equation:

Perimeter = n \* s

P = a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i

where a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, and i are the lengths of the sides of the nonagon, and P is the perimeter.

We are given that the perimeter of the nonagon is 532cm. Let's substitute this value into the formula:

532 = 26 + 45 + 75 + 68 + 63 + 80 + 100 + x + x

where x is the length of the ninth side.

Now we can solve for x:

532 = 26 + 45 + 75 + 68 + 63 + 80 + 100 + x + x
532 = 26 + 45 + 75 + 68 + 63 + 80 + 100 + 2x

The perimeter of the shape is given as 452m.

The sum of the lengths of all sides is:

62m + 76m + 98m + 74m + ? + 54m + 4m + 24m + 48m = 452m

We know that the length of the unknown side is ?.

So, we can write the equation:

62m + 76m + 98m + 74m + ? + 54m + 4m + 24m + 48m = 452m

Now, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

254m + ? + 162m = 452m

Subtracting ? from both sides gives us:

254m + ? = 452m

Subtracting 162m from both sides gives us:

192m = 300m

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

96m = 150m

This is a contradiction, since 96m is not equal to 150m. Therefore, the equation is not solvable.</pre>

We know that the perimeter of the nonagon is 318 cm, so we can set up the equation:

We also know that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to the perimeter:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 2(a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

2(a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i) = 318

Simplifying, we get:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 159

Now we can solve for the unknown side length. Let's call it x. We know that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to the perimeter, so we can set up the equation:

Substituting the values we know, we get:

Simplifying, we get:

Subtracting 245 from both sides, we get:

So the length of the unknown side is 73 cm.</pre>

We are also told that each side is the same length, so we can set up the equation:

s = x

where x is the length of each side.

Now we can solve the system of equations:

418 = n \* x
x = x

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

418 = n \* x
418 = 11 \* x

Dividing both sides by x, we get:

n = 11

So there are 11 sides to the regular polygon.

Now we can find the length of each side by using the formula:

s = perimeter / n

s = 418 / 11

s = 37.14

So the length of each side of the regular polygon is 37.14m.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the formula for the perimeter of a polygon:

Perimeter = a + b + c + d + e

where a, b, c, d, and e are the lengths of the sides of the polygon.

In this case, we know that the perimeter of the polygon is 278m, so we can set up the equation:

a + b + c + d + e = 278

We also know that the length of the sixth side is x, so we can write the equation as:

a + b + c + d + e + x = 278

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides of a polygon is equal to the perimeter of the polygon to write:

a + b + c + d + e = 278

Subtracting this equation from the previous equation, we get:

x = 278 - (a + b + c + d + e)

We know that the sum of the lengths of the sides of a polygon is equal to half the perimeter, so we can write:

a + b + c + d + e = 139

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

x = 278 - (139)

x = 139

So, the length of the sixth side is 139m.</pre>

where x is the length of the unknown eleventh side.

Now, let's solve for x. We can do this by subtracting the first ten sides from both sides of the equation:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by finding the perimeter of the nonagon.

The perimeter of a nonagon is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since we know the length of eight sides, we can find the length of the ninth side by using the formula:

Perimeter = 8(a) + 9(b)

where a is the length of the first side and b is the length of the second side.

We are given that the total perimeter of the nonagon is 188m, so we can set up the equation:

8(a) + 9(b) = 188

Now, we can solve for a and b.

First, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:

8a + 9b = 188

Next, we can subtract 8a from both sides of the equation to get:

9b = 170

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9 to get:

b = 19

Now, we can find the length of the first side by using the formula:

a = (188 - 9b) / 8

Substituting the value of b that we found earlier, we get:

a = (188 - 19) / 8

a = 16

So, the length of the first side is 16m.

Now, we can find the length of the second side by using the formula:

b = (188 - 8a) / 9

Substituting the value of a that we found earlier, we get:

b = (188 - 16) / 9

b = 11

So, the length of the second side is 11m.

Therefore, the lengths of the sides of the nonagon are:

16m, 7m, 10m, 16m, 32m, 15m, 70m, 11m

The total perimeter of the nonagon is 188m, which is correct.</pre>

P = a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 286

where a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h are the lengths of the sides of the polygon.

We know that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to the perimeter:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 286

We also know that the length of the last side is unknown, so we can write:

h = x

Substituting this into the equation for the perimeter, we get:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g + x = 286

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g + x = 286

Now we can solve for x:

x = 286 - (a + b + c + d + e + f + g)

We can find the sum of the first seven sides by adding them up:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 59 + 16 + 15 + 35 + 89 + 16 + 43 = 286

So we can substitute this value into the equation for x:

x = 286 - (59 + 16 + 15 + 35 + 89 + 16 + 43)

x = 286 - 206

x = 86

Therefore, the length of the last side of the polygon is 86m.</pre>

We also know that the lengths of the first 11 sides are given as follows:

where n is the number of sides and s is the length of each side.

In this case, the number of sides is 5, so we can plug that value into the formula:

To solve for s, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

We also know that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to the perimeter:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  The perimeter of a regular octagon is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since the perimeter is given as 632m, we can set up the equation:

where s is the length of one side of the octagon.

We can simplify the equation by noticing that the sum of the first 7 terms is equal to 2^7, which is equal to 128. Therefore, we can write:

Perimeter = 2(s + s/2 + s/4 + s/8 + ... + s/2^7) = 2(s + s/2 + s/4 + s/8 + ... + 128)

Simplifying further, we get:

Perimeter = 2(s + 64) = 128s + 128

Solving for s, we get:

s = (128Perimeter - 128)/128

Substituting the given value of Perimeter, we get:

The perimeter of a nonagon is given by the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since we know the length of all the sides except one, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a polygon to find the length of the missing side:

Perimeter = a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i

where a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, and i are the lengths of the sides of the nonagon, and i is the length of the missing side.

We are given that the total perimeter of the nonagon is 402m. So, we can set up the equation:

a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i = 402

We also know that the length of the sides are:

a = 50m
b = 31m
c = 24m
d = 28m
e = 13m
f = 97m
g = 63m
h = 88m

We can substitute these values into the equation above:

50 + 31 + 24 + 28 + 13 + 97 + 63 + 88 + i = 402

Now, we can solve for i:

i = 402 - 50 - 31 - 24 - 28 - 13 - 97 - 63 - 88

i = 402 - 250 - 98 - 72 - 41 - 34 - 60 - 42 - 28

i = 12

So, the length of the ninth side of the nonagon is 12m.</pre>

The total perimeter of an octagon is 8 times the length of each side, so the perimeter of the octagon is 8s.

We know that the perimeter of the octagon is 496 meters, so we can set up the equation:

8s = 496

To solve for s, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8:

s = 496/8

s = 64

So, the length of each side of the octagon is 64 meters.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the formula for the perimeter of a polygon: P = n x s, where n is the number of sides, and s is the length of each side.

In this case, we know that the total perimeter of the polygon is 330 m, and we have 8 sides. So, we can set up the equation:

P = 8 x s

We also know that the sum of the lengths of the 7 sides is equal to the perimeter minus the length of the 8th side:

7m + 59m + 49m + 38m + 53m + 21m + 34m = 330m - s

We can simplify this equation by combining the like terms:

7m + 59m + 49m + 38m + 53m + 21m + 34m = 330m - s

7m + 59m + 49m + 38m + 53m + 21m = 330m - s

7m + 59m + 49m + 38m + 53m = 330m - s - 21m

7m + 59m + 49m + 38m + 53m = 310m

Now we have 2 equations and 7 variables (m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7). We can solve for m8 by substituting the values of the other variables into the equation:

m8 = 310m - (7m + 59m + 49m + 38m + 53m)

m8 = 310m - (7m + 59m + 49m + 38m + 53m)

m8 = 310m - (7m + 158m)

m8 = 310m - 235m

m8 = -105m

So, the length of the 8th side of the polygon is -105m.</pre>

We know that the perimeter of the hexagon is 380m, so we can set up the equation:

6s = 380

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides of a regular hexagon is equal to the perimeter:

s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6 = 380

where s1, s2, s3, s4, and s5 are the lengths of the five sides that we know, and s6 is the length of the sixth side that we want to find.

We can substitute the values we know for the first five sides into the equation:

9 + 49 + 100 + 73 + 84 + s6 = 380

Now, we can solve for s6:

s6 = 380 - 9 - 49 - 100 - 73 - 84

s6 = 380 - 262

s6 = 118

So, the length of the sixth side of the regular hexagon is 118m.</pre>

Perimeter = âˆ‘ (n-2) times each side length

In this case, the number of sides is 7, so we can plug that in:

Perimeter = (7-2) times each side length
Perimeter = 5 times each side length

Next, we need to find the length of each side:

Side 1 = 23m

Side 3 = 57m
Side 4 = 94m

Solving for the missing side length, we get:

? = 419m - 23m - 67m - 57m - 94m - 93m - 18m

? = 150m

Let's start by finding the perimeter of the known sides:

24m + 25m + 75m + 38m + 18m + 42m + 61m = 359m

Now, let's use the formula for the perimeter of a decagon:

P = 10(s1 + s2 + ... + sn)

where s1, s2, ..., sn are the lengths of the sides.

We know that the perimeter is 359m, so we can set up the equation:

10(s1 + s2 + ... + sn) = 359

Now, we can solve for one of the unknown sides by using the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to half the perimeter:

s1 + s2 + ... + sn = 1/2 \* 359

We can simplify this equation by using the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to the perimeter minus the length of the last side:

s1 + s2 + ... + sn = 359 - 61

Now, we can solve for one of the unknown sides by substituting the value of the sum of the lengths of the sides into the equation:

s1 + s2 + ... + sn = 359 - 61

s1 + s2 + ... + sn = 308

Now, we can solve for one of the unknown sides by dividing both sides of the equation by the number of sides:

s1 + s2 + ... + sn = 308 / 8

s1 + s2 + ... + sn = 38.75

Now, we can find the length of one of the unknown sides by subtracting the sum of the known sides from the sum of the unknown sides:

s1 = 38.75 - 24 - 25 - 75 - 38 - 18 - 42 - 61

s1 = 38.75 - 240

s1 = -201.25

So, the length of one of the unknown sides is -201.25m.</pre>

P = n(a1 + a2 + ... + an)

where n is the number of sides, and ai is the length of the ith side.

In this case, the perimeter of the nonagon is given as 368m, and the number of sides is 9.

So, we can set up the equation:

368 = 9(a1 + a2 + ... + an)

We know that the sum of the side lengths is equal to the perimeter, so we can write:

a1 + a2 + ... + an = 368

We also know that the length of the final side is 2m.

So, we can write:

a1 + a2 + ... + an - 2m = 368

We can simplify this equation by subtracting 2m from both sides:

a1 + a2 + ... + an = 368 + 2m

Now, we can solve for the length of the final side by dividing both sides by 9:

a1 + a2 + ... + an = 368 + 2m

a1 + a2 + ... + an = 368 + 2(52)

a1 + a2 + ... + an = 368 + 104

a1 + a2 + ... + an = 472

Now, we can find the length of the final side by subtracting the sum of the other side lengths from the total perimeter:

2m = 472 - (52 + 52 + 44 + 53 + 41 + 91 + 25 + 2)

2m = 472 - 300

2m = 172

So, the length of the final side is 172m.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  The perimeter of a regular decagon is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since the perimeter is 140m, we can set up the equation:

140 = 2a + 3a + 4a + 5a + 6a + 7a + 8a + 9a + 10a

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the length of the 11th side of the polygon, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a polygon, which is:

Perimeter = n \* s

where n is the number of sides of the polygon and s is the length of each side.

In this case, we are given that the total perimeter of the polygon is 655cm, and we know that the length of each side is between 44cm and 39cm.

We can start by using the formula to find the number of sides of the polygon:

Perimeter = n \* s
655 = n \* (44+5+96+78+49+84+72+74+21+39)

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

655 = n \* (44+5+96+78+49+84+72+74+21+39)
655 = n \* 300

Now we can solve for n:

n = 655 / 300
n = 2

So the polygon has 21 sides.

We can now use the formula to find the length of the 11th side:

Side 11 = s

We know that the length of each side is between 44cm and 39cm, so we can find the length of the 11th side by using the formula:

Side 11 = (44+5+96+78+49+84+72+74+21+39) / 2
Side 11 = 300 / 2
Side 11 = 150cm

Therefore, the length of the 11th side of the polygon is 150cm.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by finding the perimeter of the polygon:

P = a + b + c + d + e

where a, b, c, d, and e are the lengths of the sides of the polygon.

We know that the perimeter of the polygon is 265m, so we can set up the equation:

265 = a + b + c + d + e

We also know that the sum of the lengths of the sides is equal to the perimeter:

a + b + c + d + e = 265

We can use this equation to eliminate one of the variables. Let's choose to eliminate e. We can do this by subtracting e from both sides of the equation:

265 - e = a + b + c + d

Now we have two equations and five variables. We can solve for e by substituting the first equation into the second equation:

265 - e = a + b + c + d
265 = a + b + c + d + e

Now we can solve for e by subtracting the two equations:

e = 265 - a - b - c - d

Now we have the value of e, and we can find the length of the remaining side by substituting the value of e into the equation for the perimeter:

a + b + c + d + e = 265

a + b + c + d + (265 - a - b - c - d) = 265

a + b + c + d + 265 - a - b - c - d = 265

a + b + c + d = 265

Now we can find the length of the remaining side by subtracting the sum of the lengths of the other sides from the total perimeter:

a + b + c + d - (69 + 81 + 34 + 35 + 38) = 265

a + b + c + d - 265 = -174

a + b + c + d = 174

So the length of the remaining side is 174m.</pre>
