            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The number of guests who left the party is 826.
The total number of guests who arrived at the party is 1436.
The number of guests who left the party is equal to the number of guests who arrived at the party minus the number of guests who left the party.

Therefore, the number of guests left at the party is:
1436 - 826 = 610

However, due to a sudden change in weather, 826 of those guests had to leave. Meanwhile, in a nearby smaller village, the villagers were also celebrating with a party and by the afternoon they had 1055 guests.

The number of guests who left the larger party is 826.
The number of guests who left the larger party is equal to the number of guests who arrived at the larger party minus the number of guests who left the party.

Therefore, the number of guests left at the larger party is:
1436 - 826 = 610

The number of guests who arrived at the smaller party is 1055.
The number of guests who arrived at the smaller party is equal to the number of guests who left the larger party plus the number of guests who arrived at the smaller party.

Therefore, the number of guests at the smaller party is:
610 + 1055 = 1665

The number of guests at the smaller party is more than the number left at the larger party.
