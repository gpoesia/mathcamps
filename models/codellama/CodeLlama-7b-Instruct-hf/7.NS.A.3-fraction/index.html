            Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?

22/3 x 22/19 = 11/3

This means that Carla could grow 11/3 cucumbers per plant.

After a few months, Carla realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. This means that she could grow:

            King Arthur is calculating the costs for restoring his castle. The wall repairs cost 26/22 of his castle's annual budget. Meanwhile, the moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget. Finally, installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget. How much (expressed as a fraction of the castle's annual budget) has King Arthur spent on these projects in total?

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total amount spent on these projects, we need to add the fractions together:

26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3 = 26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3

Simplifying the fractions:

26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3 = 26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3

Combining like terms:

26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3 = 26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3

Simplifying the fractions:

26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3 = 26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3

Comparing the denominators:

22 = 29

Multiplying both sides by 29/22:

26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3 = 26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3

Simplifying the fractions:

26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3 = 26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3

Comparing the numerators:

26 + 4 + 11 = 41

So, the total amount spent on these projects is 41/22 of the castle's annual budget.

            A giraffe at the local zoo has a peculiar eating habit. When it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves, it eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day. If the zoo calculates the weekly feeding amount by multiplying the daily intake by itself (making the result &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;) and then multiplying that with the regular daily intake, how many pounds of acacia leaves should they prepare for the giraffe for a week? Calculate ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26))^2 * ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26)) and provide your answer.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the weekly feeding amount for the giraffe, we need to follow the instructions provided in the problem.

First, we need to calculate the daily intake of acacia leaves for the giraffe. We are given that the giraffe eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day when it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves. So, the daily intake of acacia leaves for the giraffe is:

(30/26) \* (25/19) = 30/21

Now, we need to calculate the weekly feeding amount for the giraffe. The problem states that the zoo calculates the weekly feeding amount by multiplying the daily intake by itself (making the result &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;) and then multiplying that with the regular daily intake.

So, the weekly feeding amount for the giraffe can be calculated as:

((30/21)^2 \* (30/21)) \* (25/19) = 105/19^2 \* (25/19)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

105/19^2 \* (25/19) = 105/19^2 \* 25/19 = 2775/19^2

Therefore, the zoo should prepare 2775/19^2 = 2775/361 = 75.125 pounds of acacia leaves for the giraffe for a week.

Plane A travels at a speed of 24/11 miles per minute, so it travels 11 miles in one minute.
Plane B travels at a speed of 26/27 miles per minute, so it travels 27 miles in one minute.

Therefore, the difference in distance traveled by Plane A and Plane B after one minute is:

27 miles - 11 miles = 16 miles

16 miles is a simplified fraction, so the answer is:

What is the final time you spent on producing the song, if your total time is expressed as (b - (18 / 4))?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's first calculate the total time you spent on producing the song:

b = p + (16/4) + (16/29) + (28/13)
b = p + 4 + 4.5 + 13
b = p + 19

Now, let's subtract the time the drummer saved you:

b - (18/4) = p + 19 - (18/4)
b - (18/4) = p + 19 - 4.5
b - (18/4) = p + 14.5

So, the final time you spent on producing the song is p + 14.5 hours.</pre>

2. She bakes additional 29/17 dozens of cookies to add into her stock.
3. She decides to increase her total stock of cookies by a ratio of 7/5 for an upcoming cookie festival.

To find the total number of dozens of cookies Monica will have for the cookie festival, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she has after adding the additional 29/17 dozens of cookies.

Total number of cookies = 21/15 dozens + 29/17 dozens
Total number of cookies = 21/15 + 29/17
Total number of cookies = 40/15 + 29/17
Total number of cookies = 59/15

We know that 26/24 kg of sugar is required per cake, so we can multiply this by the number of cakes being made:

26/24 kg/cake x 1 cake = 26/24 kg

Since the chef starts with 28 kg of sugar, they will have 28-26/24 = 2/24 kg of sugar left after making one cake.

To find out how much sugar the chef will have left after adding 10/6 kg of sugar to their supply, we can add the amount of sugar added to the amount of sugar left:

2/24 kg + 10/6 kg = 2/24 kg + 10/6 kg = 12/24 kg

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many colored pencils Marta uses for shading in her art projects over an 11-day period, we need to first find out how many colored pencils she uses in total over an 11-day period.

We know that Marta uses 20 colored pencils every 11 days on her art projects, so we can multiply the number of days by the number of colored pencils used per day to get the total number of colored pencils used:

20 colored pencils/11 days = 1.76 colored pencils/day

We can then multiply the number of days by the number of colored pencils used per day to get the total number of colored pencils used:

11 days \* 1.76 colored pencils/day = 11.94 colored pencils

Next, we need to find out how many colored pencils Marta uses for shading techniques. We know that she uses about 23 out of every 26 colored pencils for shading techniques, so we can multiply the number of colored pencils used for shading by the number of colored pencils used for shading to get the total number of colored pencils used for shading:

23/26 colored pencils for shading \* 23/26 colored pencils for shading = 5.55 colored pencils for shading

Finally, we can subtract the number of colored pencils used for shading from the total number of colored pencils used to find out how many colored pencils Marta uses for other art projects:

11.94 colored pencils - 5.55 colored pencils for shading = 6.39 colored pencils for other art projects

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator:

6.39 colored pencils for other art projects = 6.39/1 colored pencils for other art projects

Therefore, Marta uses 6.39/1 colored pencils for other art projects over an 11-day period.</pre>

            A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

The common denominator is 51. To find the ratio of the changes, we can divide the first fraction by the second fraction:

26/6 / 25/17 = 26/25

The ratio of the changes is 26/25, or 1/1.

To find the difference between the two rates, we can subtract the second rate from the first rate:

The difference between the two rates is 1/23.

We know that the machine starts by mixing 24/8 gallons of red paint, so we can write:

d = 24/8

Next, we know that the machine pours away 12/8 gallons of the mix. We can subtract this amount from the amount of red paint left in the machine:

d - 12/8 = ?

Now, we are told that the machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color. We can add this amount to the amount of red paint left in the machine:

d + 1/28 = ?

Finally, we are asked to find the value of 'x', which is the total amount of paint. We can use the equation we set up earlier to find 'x':

x = d + 1/28

Now, we can substitute the values we have found for 'd' and 'x' in the equation:

x = (24/8) + 1/28

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 31/28

So, the total amount of paint is 31/28 gallons.</pre>

            Sonia uses 21/12 oz of toothpaste to brush her teeth every day. Her brother Anthony uses less toothpaste, just 6/27 oz daily. Add both quantities of toothpaste to get the total daily amount used by Sonia and Anthony.

Now, suppose their mom includes an amount of toothpaste for herself to the total - she uses 3/18 oz of toothpaste daily. Add this amount to the total used by Sonia and Anthony to get the final total daily toothpaste usage for the whole family. Solve each fraction separately and give the answer as a simplified fraction.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total daily amount of toothpaste used by Sonia and Anthony, we need to add their individual usage:

Sonia: 21/12 oz + 6/27 oz = 27/12 oz = 3/4 oz
Anthony: 6/27 oz = 1/4 oz

So, the total daily amount of toothpaste used by Sonia and Anthony is:
3/4 oz + 1/4 oz = 4/4 oz = 1 oz

Now, let's find the total daily amount of toothpaste used by the whole family by adding the amount used by Sonia and Anthony and their mom:

Sonia and Anthony: 1 oz
Mom: 3/18 oz

So, the total daily amount of toothpaste used by the whole family is:
1 oz + 3/18 oz = 1 oz + 3/18 oz = 1 oz + 3/18 oz = 4/18 oz = 2/9 oz

Therefore, the simplified fraction for the total daily amount of toothpaste used by the whole family is:

            Let's suppose for a special recipe sandwich, you need to divide a wheel of cheese into 14 equal parts and a pickle jar into 18 equal parts. 

To make one special sandwich, you need 21 parts of the wheel of cheese and 7 parts from the pickle jar.

You've just made these sandwiches and you are down to ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of your original ingredients.

Later, you decided to make a simpler version of the sandwich which required half of the wheel of cheese and did not use any pickles.

What fraction of the original ingredients do you have left after making the simpler sandwich? Calculate the answer by subtracting (2 / 4) from the fraction you had after making the first sandwich.

After making the first sandwich, you had ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) = (7/18) + (21/14) = 0.41 + 0.85 = 0.86 of the original ingredients left.

Now, if you subtract (2 / 4) from 0.86, you get 0.86 - (2/4) = 0.86 - 0.5 = 0.36.

So, you have 0.36 of the original ingredients left after making the simpler sandwich.</pre>

where d is the amount of cheese Jeremy received, n is the amount of cheese he ordered, and 17/22 is the amount of cheese that was less than the amount he ordered.

We know that Jeremy ordered 30/9 ounces of cheese, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

Sophia decided to add these numbers to her total. Next, she added the additional 21 out of 17 sunglasses from another batch that also blocked all UV rays.

Later, she realized she made a mistake and needed to subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that actually did not block all UV rays.

            A car travels 21/4 miles every hour. One day, the car was needed to travel an extra 16/13 miles, but due to a detour, it only traveled an additional 1/21 miles. How many more miles was the car supposed to travel in total that day, given that it ran continuously at the same speed?

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's first calculate the total distance the car traveled in one hour:

21/4 miles/hour = 5 miles/hour

So, the car traveled 5 miles in one hour.

Now, let's calculate the total distance the car traveled in a day:

5 miles/hour x 24 hours = 120 miles

The car traveled 120 miles in a day.

Now, let's calculate the additional distance the car needed to travel:

16/13 miles = 1.25 miles

So, the car needed to travel an additional 1.25 miles.

The car only traveled an additional 1/21 miles due to the detour, so we need to subtract that from the total additional distance:

1.25 miles - 1/21 miles = 1.25 - 0.047 = 1.21 miles

Therefore, the car was supposed to travel an additional 1.21 miles in total that day, given that it ran continuously at the same speed.

To calculate the total distance the car traveled in total, we need to add the distance it traveled in a day to the additional distance it needed to travel:

120 miles + 1.21 miles = 120 + 1.21 = 121.21 miles

Therefore, the car was supposed to travel a total of 121.21 miles that day, given that it ran continuously at the same speed.</pre>

1. Each row yields approximately 21/3 bushels.
2. Jenny sells her yield at the farmer's market where each bushel earns her 21/15 dollars.

To find the total number of dollars Jenny will make, we need to calculate the total number of bushels she sells.

Total number of bushels = Number of rows x Yield per row
Total number of bushels = 13/11 rows x 21/3 bushels/row
Total number of bushels = 13/11 x 21/3 = 21/11 bushels

Now, we can calculate the total number of dollars Jenny will make by multiplying the total number of bushels by the price she earns per bushel.

Total number of dollars = Total number of bushels x Price per bushel
Total number of dollars = 21/11 bushels x 21/15 dollars/bushel
Total number of dollars = 21/11 x 21/15 = 21/15 dollars

Therefore, Jenny will make 21/15 dollars in total by selling all her potatoes.</pre>

            In a beehive, there are sections for honey storage and bee rearing. Each section is classified into many sub-sections. One day, the beekeeper discovered that each honey storage sub-section had (25 / 9) gallons of honey. He also found the same amount of honey in each bee rearing sub-section. 

If he combined the honey from both a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the beekeeper would have a total quantity represented by 'p'. 

However, one honey storage sub-section had an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey. So, if the beekeeper was calculating the total amount from this sub-section plus a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be defined as 's'. 

What quantity of honey ('s') would the beekeeper have in total from this scenario?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's denote the total amount of honey in the honey storage sub-section with an additional (2/26) gallons as 's'.

From the problem statement, we know that the total amount of honey in the honey storage sub-section without the additional (2/26) gallons is (25/9) gallons.

So, the total amount of honey in the honey storage sub-section with the additional (2/26) gallons is (25/9) + (2/26) = (25 + 2)/9 = 27/9 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of honey in the bee rearing sub-section:

The total amount of honey in the bee rearing sub-section is (25/9) gallons, as stated in the problem statement.

So, the total amount of honey in both the honey storage sub-section and the bee rearing sub-section is (25/9) + (27/9) = 25 + 27 = 52/9 gallons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of honey the beekeeper would have in total:

The total amount of honey the beekeeper would have in total is the sum of the honey in the honey storage sub-section with the additional (2/26) gallons and the honey in the bee rearing sub-section:

s + p = (27/9) + (52/9) = 27 + 52 = 79/9 gallons

Therefore, the total amount of honey the beekeeper would have in total is 79/9 gallons.</pre>

            Johnny is building a scooter from scratch. He needs to drill holes into the scooter deck to attach the wheels. The size of each hole should be approximately (20/6) cm in diameter. Unfortunately, his drill bit only has a diameter of (11/21) cm. If he uses his current drill bit, he needs to drill a hole, move it over and drill again to achieve the diameter he needs. If he drills each hole exactly once with his drill bit, calculate what fraction of the desired diameter would each hole have? Don't simplify the fraction, keep as (20/6) * (11 / 21).

(11/21) cm / 3.33 cm = 0.52

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the number of units of wood needed to make one of these special chairs, we need to first find the number of units of wood used by Carlos to make a regular chair.

Carlos uses 20/15 units of wood to make each regular chair.

So, the number of units of wood used by Carlos to make one regular chair is 20/15 = 1.33 units.

Now, for the special order, Carlos needs to use (24/5) times (7/6) units more wood than usual.

(24/5) = 4.8 times
(7/6) = 1.1 times

So, Carlos needs to use 4.8 x 1.1 = 5.28 units of wood to make one special chair.

Since we need to find the number of units of wood needed to make one special chair, we can simplify the answer by dividing the number of units of wood needed by the number of units of wood used by Carlos to make one regular chair.

5.28 / 1.33 = 3.85

Next, we know that the car slowed down by 14/15 miles per minute, which means that its speed decreased by 14/15 = 0.96 miles per minute. So, the car's speed after the slowdown was 3.25 - 0.96 = 2.29 miles per minute.

Finally, we know that the car increased its speed again by 30/15 miles per minute, which means that its speed increased by 30/15 = 2 miles per minute. So, the car's speed after the second speed increase was 2.29 + 2 = 4.29 miles per minute.

2. Jake gets to keep 7/11 of the total amount of grapes, so the number of baskets of grapes he gets is 7/11 x 19 = 13.5. Since Jake can't have a fraction of a basket, he gets 13 whole baskets of grapes.
3. Jake uses 9/10 of his grapes to make grape juice, so the number of baskets of grapes he uses for the juice is 9/10 x 13 = 10.5. Since Jake can't have a fraction of a basket, he uses 11 whole baskets of grapes for the juice.</pre>

The lion ate 28/26 of a zebra in one day, which means it ate 28/26 of the total amount of zebra.

The lion ate 23/9 of a wildebeest in the next day, which means it ate 23/9 of the total amount of wildebeest.

To find the ratio of the amount of zebra eaten by the lion to the amount of zebra eaten by the wildebeest, we can divide the amount of zebra eaten by the lion by the amount of zebra eaten by the wildebeest:

(28/26)/(23/9) = 11/10

This means that the lion ate 11/10 of the amount of zebra eaten by the wildebeest.

Therefore, the lion ate 11/10 less of the zebra compared to the wildebeest.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator, which is 10 in this case.

To calculate the expected number of bananas produced by the first species, we need to find the probability that the first species produces 12 bananas in 29 days. This can be done by dividing the number of days that the first species produces 12 bananas by the total number of days in the year:

(12 / 29) = 0.42

Similarly, we can calculate the probability that the second species produces 30 bananas in 10 days:

(30 / 10) = 3

Now, we can add the probabilities to get the expected number of bananas produced by both species on a given day:

((0.42) + (3)) = 3.42

            A bear spends 18 hours of the day sleeping. Given that each day has 24 hours, this bear spends 18/24th of each day asleep. For 27 days of the month, the bear's activity is tracked. Assume that the bear has a regular sleeping pattern. Calculate the fraction of time the bear has spent sleeping over the 27 days assuming each month has 13 weeks. Your answer should be the result of (18 / 24) * (27 / 13). Write your answer as a decimal.

To calculate the fraction of time the bear has spent sleeping over the 27 days, we can multiply the fraction of time the bear spends sleeping by the number of days:

(18/24) * (27/13) = 0.75 * 2.0 = 1.50

Therefore, the bear has spent 1.50 days sleeping over the 27 days.</pre>

            In a beautiful forest, the park rangers recorded that 9 out of every 14 trees were pine trees. They also noticed an exceptional occurrence where 19 out of every 2 trees were birches.

            Teddy, the bear, loves to play hide and seek with his friends. One day, he decided to play a game where he hides some number of his stuffed animal friends. Teddy hides 18/11 of his friends in the forest and 8/21 of his friends at the beach. First calculate how many more friends Teddy hides in the forest than at the beach. Let's call this number 'f'.

Teddy hides 18/11 of his friends in the forest, so he hides 18/11 = 1.62 friends in the forest.

Teddy hides 8/21 of his friends at the beach, so he hides 8/21 = 0.38 friends at the beach.

The difference in the number of friends Teddy hides in the forest and at the beach is 1.62 - 0.38 = 1.24.

Now, let's square the difference to find 'n', the total number of hiding spots Teddy needs.

n = (1.24)^2 = 1.536

            During rainy weather, a small snail moves at a snail-pace covering 17/21 of a meter in an hour. Another slightly faster snail covers 20/24 of a meter in the same time during such weather. 

One rainy day, the first snail started an hour earlier than the second. At the time when the second snail began, a third snail that covers 18/17 of a meter per hour also started moving. 

What is their total distance in meters 1 hour after all three have started moving? Compute the result using the operation ((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) for the first two snails' distance, and multiply this result by (18 / 17) for the total distance , including the third snail.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's first calculate the distance covered by the first two snails in one hour:

1. The first snail covers 17/21 of a meter in an hour, so it covers 17/21 \* 60 minutes = 10.5 meters in one hour.
2. The second snail covers 20/24 of a meter in an hour, so it covers 20/24 \* 60 minutes = 12 meters in one hour.

The total distance covered by the first two snails in one hour is 10.5 + 12 = 22.5 meters.

Now, let's calculate the distance covered by the third snail in one hour:

18/17 of a meter per hour is equivalent to 1 meter per 17 minutes, so the third snail covers 1 meter in 17 minutes.

Therefore, the third snail covers 17 minutes \* 1 meter = 17 meters in one hour.

The total distance covered by all three snails in one hour is the sum of the distances covered by the first two snails and the third snail:

22.5 meters (first two snails) + 17 meters (third snail) = 39.5 meters

Therefore, the total distance in meters is 39.5 meters.</pre>

We know that 2/10 of the total number of kids in the park are waiting for the swings. So, we can write:

2/10x = 21/4

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:

x = 21/4

Now, we can substitute this value of x into the first equation:

2/10x = 21/4

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:

2/10 = 21/4

Now, we can divide both sides by 2/10 to solve for x:

1 = 21/4

Now, we can divide both sides by 21 to solve for x:

1 = 4/21

Now, we can multiply both sides by 21 to solve for x:

21 = 4

Now, we can divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

21/4 = 5

            A monkey finds a pile of bananas and ends up eating (22 / 7) times (10 / 25) of the pile. Later, he gives (3 / 28) of the pile to his friend. How much of the pile does the monkey have left?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that the monkey ate (22/7) times (10/25) of the pile.

First, we can simplify the fraction (22/7) by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 22 and 7, which is 1.

So, (22/7) = (22/7) \* (1/GCD(22,7)) = (22/7) \* (1/1) = 3.

Now, we can multiply the fraction (3/1) by (10/25) to get the total number of bananas the monkey ate:

(3/1) \* (10/25) = 30/25 = 1.2

Now, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get the total number of bananas the monkey ate:

1.2 = 2

So, the monkey ate 2 bananas.

Next, we need to find out how much of the pile the monkey has left. We know that the monkey gave (3/28) of the pile to his friend, so we can find the total number of bananas the monkey has left by subtracting the number of bananas he gave to his friend from the total number of bananas he ate:

2 - (3/28) = 2 - (3/28) \* 28 = 2 - 8 = -6

So, the monkey has -6 bananas left.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many ounces of beverage were consumed, we need to first find the number of glasses that were consumed. We can do this by multiplying the number of glasses consumed by the number of ounces in each glass.

26/25 of the glasses were consumed, so we can multiply 26 by 25 to find the total number of glasses consumed:

26 \* 25 = 675

Now, we can multiply the number of glasses consumed by the number of ounces in each glass to find the total number of ounces consumed:

675 \* 29/9 = 106.25

So, 106.25 ounces of beverage were consumed.

Now, let's find out how many total ounces of beverages were consumed at the party. We can do this by adding the number of ounces consumed to the number of ounces that were consumed in the additional 2/19 ounces of beverages:

106.25 + 2/19 = 106.25 + 0.105 = 106.35

            Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements.

            Callie owns a pen business. Last month, she sold 20 pens for every 15 she produced. At the same time, she sold an additional 16 pens for every 22 she put out for sale. 

Meanwhile, she found that for every 22 pens she advertised, 27 were interested customers. For each 23 pens she produced this week, she was able to sell 8. 

What is the result when she multiplies the ratio of last month's sales to production (20/15 + 16/22) and this week's figure for the ratio of interested customers to production (22/27 * 23/8)? Leave your answer as an unsimplified fraction.

            In a snow fight, Mike threw 9/19 of his snowballs and his friend, John threw 6/8 of his snowballs. After a while, Mike found 4 more snowballs to throw.

The question is, if 'u' represents the number of snowballs thrown by both Mike and John and 'j' is the total number of snowballs Mike had after finding more, how many snowballs did Mike have in total?

Solve the following equations to find the variable 'j':

u = 9/19 + 6/8

First, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 19 and 8, respectively:

u \* 19 = (9/19) \* 19 + (6/8) \* 8

u \* 19 = 16 + 48

u \* 19 = 64

Now, we can solve for 'u':

u = 64/19

u = 3

Now, we can find 'j' by adding 4 to 'u':

j = u + 4/1

j = 3 + 4

j = 7

Therefore, Mike had 7 snowballs in total.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  First, let's calculate the ratio of flour to sugar for the first recipe:

(27 / 3) cups flour / (11 / 7) cups sugar = 9/10

Now, let's subtract the ratio of flour to sugar for the second recipe:

9/10 - (21 / 26) = 9/10 - 0.77 = 0.23

Now, let's add the ratio of flour to sugar for the second recipe:

0.23 + (22 / 9) = 0.23 + 2.44 = 2.67

Therefore, Debra will have a total of 2.67 cups of flour.</pre>

            There are 26/13 chickens in one farm and 9/16 chickens in another farm. Farmer John calculated the difference between the number of chickens in the two farms. After a week, the number of chickens multiplied by 19/21 due to new chickens born. How many chickens are there now in Farmer John's farm?

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information we have:

1. There are 26/13 chickens in the first farm.
2. There are 9/16 chickens in the second farm.
3. After a week, the number of chickens multiplied by 19/21 due to new chickens born.

We can start by adding the number of chickens in the two farms:

26/13 + 9/16 = 26/13 + 9/16 = 35/13

So, there are 35/13 chickens in total.

Now, let's consider the multiplication by 19/21:

35/13 x 19/21 = 625/21

So, there are 625/21 chickens in Farmer John's farm after a week.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, which is 13 in this case.

625/21 = 28/3

So, there are 28/3 chickens in Farmer John's farm after a week.

### Answer: 28/3</pre>

From the problem statement, we know that the helicopter flew a distance of 24/14 miles for the first exercise and the same distance for the second exercise.

So, the total distance flown for both exercises can be represented as:

t = w x w

We are given that 'w' is the distance flown for each exercise, so we can write:

t = w x w
= (24/14) x (24/14)
= 24 x 24
= 576

Therefore, the value of 't' is 576.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops, we need to add the fractions that the UFO was able to refill during each stop.

The UFO was able to fill 20/16 of its fuel tank during the first refuel, so it was able to refill 20/16 of the tank.

The UFO was able to fill another 24/25 of its tank during the second refuel, so it was able to refill 24/25 of the tank.

To add these fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 25, which is 60. We can then convert the fractions to decimals by multiplying by the LCM.

20/16 = 1.25 (decimal)
24/25 = 0.96 (decimal)

We can then add the decimals to get the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops:

1.25 + 0.96 = 2.21

Therefore, the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops is 2.21.</pre>

            Professor Astro is working on his telescope. He believes the power of his telescope is directly proportional to the sum of two fractions. The first fraction is the light gathering power of the lens, which is 24 out of 27. The second fraction is the zooming potential, which is 30 out of 26. So, Professor Astro calculates the sum of these two fractions ((24 / 27) + (30 / 26)). What does he find?

First, we need to simplify the fractions:

28/20 = 28/20 Ã— 1 = 28
