        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many pairs of ice skates the Ice Skating Center has left, we need to subtract the number of pairs of skates that were rented out for children's lessons from the total number of pairs of skates at the beginning of the season.

847 - 297 = 540

Therefore, the Ice Skating Center has 540 pairs of ice skates left.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the current number of monkeys in the jungle, we need to subtract the number of monkeys that have died or been eaten from the initial population of 752.

We know that the population has reduced by 454, so we can subtract that number from the initial population to find the current population:

752 - 454 = 308

Therefore, there are currently 308 monkeys in the jungle.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  There are 59 ballerinas practicing in the morning session and 70 ballerinas practicing in the afternoon session.

To find the total number of ballerinas practicing throughout the day, we need to add the number of ballerinas practicing in the morning session to the number of ballerinas practicing in the afternoon session.

59 + 70 = 129

Therefore, there are 129 ballerinas practicing throughout the day.</pre>
