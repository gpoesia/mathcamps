        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To multiply the fractions 8/9 and 19/3, we need to follow the standard procedure for multiplying fractions.

First, we need to convert the fractions to their equivalent decimals.

8/9 = 0.8888888888888889
19/3 = 0.6333333333333333

Now, we can multiply the decimals to get the product:

0.8888888888888889 x 0.6333333333333333 = 0.5622222222222222

Next, we need to convert the product back to a fraction. To do this, we can divide the product by its greatest common divisor (GCD):

0.5622222222222222 / 1 = 0.5622222222222222

Therefore, the product of the fractions 8/9 and 19/3 is 0.5622222222222222.</pre>

            Julian is cutting sections of rope for a project. Each section is 13/2 feet long. He is only able to use 5/7 of each section. How many feet are in the usable part of each section of rope? Calculate this by multiplying 13/2 by 5/7.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the usable length of each section of rope, we need to multiply the length of each section by the fraction of the section that is usable.

The length of each section is 13/2 feet, which is equal to 6.5 feet.

The fraction of the section that is usable is 5/7, which is equal to 0.7142857142857143.

Therefore, the usable length of each section of rope is 6.5 feet multiplied by 0.7142857142857143, which is equal to 4.635483870967742 feet.

So, the usable length of each section of rope is 4.635483870967742 feet.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the result of (17 / 18) multiplied by (13 / 8), we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiply 17 and 13: 17 Ã— 13 = 221
2. Divide 221 by 18: 221 Ã· 18 = 12
3. Divide 12 by 8: 12 Ã· 8 = 1 1/2

Therefore, the result of (17 / 18) multiplied by (13 / 8) is 1 1/2.

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

1 1/2 = 3/2

So the simplified fraction is 3/2.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To determine how many pizzas the group should order, we need to calculate the total number of slices that the students will eat.

Each student will eat 17/20 of a pizza, so the total number of slices that the students will eat is:

17/20 x 18 = 324/20 = 16.2

Since pizzas are typically cut into 8-inch slices, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of pizzas. Therefore, the group should order 17 pizzas.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total length of the blocks in feet, we need to multiply the number of blocks by the length of each block.

Let's start by converting the length of each block from 16/18th of a foot to a decimal value.

16/18 = 0.9

So, each block is 0.9 feet long.

Now, let's find the total length of the blocks by multiplying the number of blocks by the length of each block.

16/7 = 2.28

So, the total length of the blocks in feet is 2.28 x 0.9 = 2.17 feet.

Therefore, the total length of the blocks in feet is 2.17 feet.</pre>

The chef can make 16 pizzas in 1 hour, which means they can make 16/54 = 0.29 pizzas per minute.
To find out how many mushroom pizzas the chef can make before they sell out, we can multiply the number of minutes they have to make pizzas by the number of pizzas they can make per minute:
54 minutes x 0.29 pizzas/minute = 16.36 pizzas

p = 5 * (14 / 16)

where p is the number of scoops needed.

First, we can simplify the fraction by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common divisor of 14 and 16, which is 1.

p = 5 * (14 / 16) = 5 * (2) = 10

So, to have 5 whole cups of flour, you would need 10 scoops.</pre>

We can rewrite this equation as:

x/17 = 5/14

Now, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 17:

x = 17(5/14)

x = 17(3/7)

x = 51

So, 51 classrooms did not recycle their papers during the specific day. This means that 51/17 = 30.43% of the total classrooms did not recycle their papers.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the product of the fractions (18/18) and (11/5), we need to multiply the numerators and denominators separately.

First, we multiply the numerators:

18 x 11 = 198

Next, we multiply the denominators:

18 x 5 = 90

Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD):

198 / 90 = 2

Therefore, the product of the fractions (18/18) and (11/5) is (2/1).</pre>
