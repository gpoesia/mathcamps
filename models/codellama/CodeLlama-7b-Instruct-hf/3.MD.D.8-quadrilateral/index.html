        The perimeter of a rectangular swimming pool is 324 meters. The length of the pool is 83 meters. What is the width of the pool?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the width of the pool, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:

Perimeter = 2(l + w)

where l is the length and w is the width.

In this case, the perimeter is 324 meters, and the length is 83 meters. So, we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 324

To solve for w, we can first solve for l:

l = 324 - 2w

Now, we can substitute this expression for l into the original equation:

2(324 - 2w) = 324

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

2(324) = 324

So, w = 112 meters.

Therefore, the width of the pool is 112 meters.</pre>

        A rectangle has a perimeter of 194 cm. The length of one of its sides is 49 cm. Can you determine the length of its other side?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can determine the length of the other side of the rectangle.

The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since the perimeter of the rectangle is 194 cm, we can set up the equation:

49 + x + x + x = 194

Where x is the length of the other side of the rectangle.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x + 49 = 194

Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:

4x = 145

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 36

Therefore, the length of the other side of the rectangle is 36 cm.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral, which is:

P = a + b + c + d

where a, b, c, and d are the lengths of the four sides of the quadrilateral.

We are given that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 229m, and we can set up the equation:

229 = a + b + c + d

We are also given that two sides of the quadrilateral have lengths of 93m and 98m, so we can write:

a = 93
b = 98

We can substitute these values into the equation for the perimeter:

229 = 93 + 98 + c + d

Simplifying the equation, we get:

136 = c + d

We are also given that the third side of the quadrilateral is 36m long, so we can write:

c = 36

Substituting this value into the equation for the perimeter, we get:

136 = 36 + d

Simplifying the equation, we get:

100 = d

Therefore, the length of the fourth side of the quadrilateral is 100m.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the width of the rectangle, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:

Perimeter = 2(l + w)

where l is the length and w is the width.

In this case, the perimeter is 228 meters, and the length is 90 meters. So, we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 228

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2l + 2w = 228

Subtracting 2l from both sides gives us:

2w = 228 - 2l

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

w = (228 - 2l) / 2

Since we are given that the perimeter is 228 meters, we can set up the equation:

2l + 2w = 228

Substituting the expression for w into this equation, we get:

2l + (228 - 2l) / 2 = 228

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2l + 114 = 228

Subtracting 2l from both sides gives us:

114 = 228 - 2l

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

57 = 2l

Since we are given that the length is 90 meters, we can set up the equation:

2l = 90

Solving for w, we get:

w = (228 - 2l) / 2

w = (228 - 90) / 2

w = 138 / 2

w = 69 meters

Therefore, the width of the rectangle is 69 meters.</pre>

Expand and simplify:

Subtract 300 from both sides:

So the width of the rectangle is -12.5 feet.

In this case, the perimeter of the rectangle is 336 feet, and the length of one side is 79 feet. So we can plug these values into the formula to solve for the length of the opposite side:

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Subtracting 2w from both sides gives us:

2l = 336 - 2w

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

l = (336 - 2w) / 2

Now we can substitute the value of w that we know, which is 79 feet, into this equation:

Perimeter = 2(l + w)

where l is the length and w is the width.

Given that the perimeter of the rectangle is 138 feet, we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 138

To solve for w, we can first solve for l:

l = (138 - 2w) / 2

Now we can substitute the expression for l into the original equation:

2(l + w) = 2((138 - 2w) / 2 + w)

Simplifying, we get:

2w = 138 - 2w

Solving for w, we get:

w = 79

So the width of the rectangle is 79 feet.</pre>

We are given that the perimeter is 200 meters, so we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 200

Simplifying the equation, we get:

l + w = 100

Now we can solve for w by subtracting l from both sides of the equation:

w = 100 - l

Since we are given that the length of the field is 49 meters, we can substitute this value into the equation:

w = 100 - 49

w = 51 meters

Therefore, the width of the field is 51 meters.</pre>

Subtracting 2w from both sides gives us:

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

Substituting 65 for l, we get:

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us:

Adding 2w to both sides gives us:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can determine the length of the other side.

The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all four sides. Since the perimeter is 242 meters, we can set up the equation:

4(97) + 4(?) = 242

where ? is the length of the other side.

Solving for ?, we get:

388 + 4(?)= 242

Subtracting 388 from both sides gives us:

4(?)-4 = 204

Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:

? = 52

Therefore, the length of the other side is 52 meters.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can determine the length of each side of the square.

To do this, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a square, which is:

Perimeter = 4 \* side length

We are given that the perimeter of the square is 316 meters, so we can set up the equation:

4 \* side length = 316

Now, we can solve for the side length by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

side length = 316 / 4

side length = 84 meters

Therefore, the length of each side of the square is 84 meters.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral: P = a + b + c + d

We know that the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 131m, so we can set up the equation:

a + b + c + d = 131

We also know that the lengths of the three sides are 24m, 57m, and 17m, so we can write:

a = 24
b = 57
c = 17

Now we can substitute these values into the equation for the perimeter:

24 + 57 + 17 + d = 131

Simplifying the equation, we get:

108 + d = 131

Subtracting 108 from both sides gives us:

d = 23

So the length of the fourth side is 23m.</pre>

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Subtracting 2w from both sides gives us:

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

l = (198 - 2w) / 2

Since we are given that the length is 90 cm, we can substitute this value into the equation:

l = (198 - 2w) / 2

Substituting 90 for l, we get:

(198 - 2w) / 2 = 90

Simplifying the equation, we get:

        A quadrilateral has a perimeter of 198m. Two of the sides have lengths of 19m and 57m respectively, another side is 22m, what is the length of the remaining side?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral: P = a + b + c + d

We know that the perimeter is 198m, so we can set up the equation:

198 = a + b + c + d

We also know that two of the sides have lengths of 19m and 57m, so we can write:

a = 19m
b = 57m

We can substitute these values into the equation for the perimeter:

198 = 19m + 57m + c + d

Simplifying the equation, we get:

198 = 76m + c + d

Now we can solve for c and d:

c = 198 - 76m - d

We can set up a system of equations by equating the two expressions for c:

198 - 76m - d = 76m + c

Subtracting 76m from both sides gives:

d = 120m

Now we can find the length of the remaining side:

c = 198 - 76m - 120m

c = 198 - 236m

c = -68m

So the length of the remaining side is -68m.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the length of each side of the square, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a square, which is 4s, where s is the length of each side.

We are given that the perimeter of the square is 304 cm.

Solving for Side Length, we get:

Side Length = 76 cm

We know that the total perimeter of the rectangle is 158 meters, so the sum of the lengths of all four sides is equal to 4 times the perimeter.

Since the shorter sides are both 51 meters long, we can write:

x + 51 = 158

Subtracting 51 from both sides gives us:

So the length of the longer side is 107 meters.</pre>
