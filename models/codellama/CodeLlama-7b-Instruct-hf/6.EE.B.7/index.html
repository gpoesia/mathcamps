        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the total space of the tent &quot;T&quot;.

We know that the inner space of the tent is 36 square meters less than the total space, so we can write:

T - 36 = inner space

We also know that the total space of the tent is 352 square meters, so we can write:

T = 352

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for the inner space by substituting the first equation into the second equation:

352 - 36 = inner space

inner space = 316

So the actual inner space of the tent is 316 square meters.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the total number of miles the car can drive on its full tank &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the first half of the tank will get the car 357 miles, so the second half will get it &quot;x - 357&quot; miles.

We also know that the total number of miles the car can drive is 743, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 357) = 743

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 357 = 743

Adding 357 to both sides:

2x = 1090

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 545

So, the second half of the tank will get the car 545 - 357 = 188 miles.</pre>

* 127 bits of eraser were cut off.
* 29 bits of eraser came from blue pencils.

We can use this information to set up an equation. Let's say the number of bits of eraser that came from red pencils is x. Then, we can write an equation based on the information given:

127 = 29 + x

Now, we need to solve for x. We can do this by subtracting 29 from both sides of the equation:

127 - 29 = x

This gives us:

88 = x

So, 88 bits of eraser came from red pencils.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the number of days in the period, we can set up a system of equations. Let's call the number of days x.

1. 1891 = 61x (since 61 fireplaces were produced per day)
2. 1891 = x(61) (since 1891 fireplaces were produced in total)

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting the second equation from the first equation:

1891 - 61x = x(61) - 1891

Simplifying this equation, we get:

61x - 1891 = 0

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1891/61

x = 30

Therefore, the period lasted 30 days.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The total rainfall in the monsoon season is 750 millimeters.
In the first half of the season, there was 359 millimeters of rainfall.
The second half of the season starts from the point where the first half ends.
So, the second half of the season starts from 359 millimeters and ends at 750 millimeters.
The difference between the starting and ending points is 359-359 = 0 millimeters.
Therefore, the city received 0 millimeters of rainfall in the second half of the season.

Since the total amount of food eaten in four weeks is 588 pounds, we can set up the equation:

147 pounds/week x weeks = 588 pounds

To solve for weeks, we can divide both sides of the equation by 147 pounds/week:

weeks = 588 pounds / 147 pounds/week

weeks = 4

We can set up the equation:

To solve for &quot;x&quot;, we can subtract 19 from both sides of the equation:

            A luxurious watch costs $422. If the manufacturing cost is $200, how much is charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  The brand value of a luxurious watch can be calculated by subtracting the manufacturing cost from the retail price.

Brand value = Retail price - Manufacturing cost
Brand value = $422 - $200
Brand value = $222

The sales profits can be calculated by subtracting the brand value from the retail price.

Sales profits = Retail price - Brand value
Sales profits = $422 - $222
Sales profits = $200

The overheads can be calculated by subtracting the sales profits from the retail price.

Overheads = Retail price - Sales profits
Overheads = $422 - $200
Overheads = $222

Therefore, the charged amount for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads is $222.</pre>
