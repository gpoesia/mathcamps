            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve for u in the equation 122 = 92 + 28 * u, we can subtract 92 from both sides of the equation, which gives us:

122 - 92 = 28 * u

This simplifies to:

20 = 28 * u

Dividing both sides of the equation by 28 gives us:

u = 20/28

u = 0.7142857142857143

Therefore, the value of u is 0.7142857142857143.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve for s in the linear equation 153 = 91 + 5s, we can subtract 91 from both sides of the equation:

153 - 91 = 5s

This equation is now in the form of a linear equation, where the variable s is on one side of the equation and the constant 5 is on the other side. To solve for s, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

s = 153 - 91 / 5

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

s = 36

Therefore, the value of s is 36.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this equation, we can first simplify the left-hand side by multiplying both sides by 3:

179 * 3 = (63 * a) + 93 * 3

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side by combining like terms:

179 * 3 = (63 * a) + 279

Now, we can subtract 279 from both sides:

179 * 3 - 279 = (63 * a)

Now, we can divide both sides by 3:

53 = 63 * a

Now, we can divide both sides by 63:

a = 53 / 63

a = 0.82

Therefore, the value of a is 0.82.</pre>
