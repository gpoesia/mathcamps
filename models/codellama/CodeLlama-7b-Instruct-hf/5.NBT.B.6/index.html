So, the total number of limbs for all the starfish is:

x \* 9 = 702

Now, we can set up an equation:

x \* 9 = 702

x = 702 / 9

x = 82

528 cubic feet / 16 = 32 cubic feet

So, each smaller snowball has a volume of 32 cubic feet.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            A slide is 728 inches long and has evenly spaced waves every 56 inches. How many waves are there on the slide?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the number of waves on the slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the distance between the waves.

728 inches / 56 inches = 13.2 waves

Since we can't have a fraction of a wave, we round up to the nearest whole number.

13.2 waves = 14 waves

Therefore, there are 14 waves on the slide.</pre>
