        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Amy sells 58 candles in the morning for a total of 58 dollars.
Amy sells 27 candles in the evening for a total of 27 dollars.
Amy uses one of the dollars she earned to pay for her parking fee, so she has 57 dollars left.

Total amount of money Amy earns = 58 dollars + 27 dollars = 85 dollars
Total amount of money Amy earns after paying for parking = 85 dollars - 1 dollar = 84 dollars

Amy sells one candle in the morning for a total of 1 dollar.
Amy sells 27 candles in the evening for a total of 27 dollars.
Amy uses one of the dollars she earned to pay for her parking fee, so she has 26 dollars left.

Total amount of money Amy earns = 1 dollar + 27 dollars = 28 dollars
Total amount of money Amy earns after paying for parking = 28 dollars - 1 dollar = 27 dollars

Ryan saved up $93 = 93 dollars.

Then, he spent $11 on a comic book.

Ryan spent $11 = 11 dollars on a comic book.

Later, he spent $64 on a new video game.

Ryan spent $64 = 64 dollars on a new video game.

If Ryan gave all his saved money to his mom and she gave him back the remaining amount after each purchase, then Ryan's mom gave him back $93 - $11 = 82 dollars.

Ryan spent $11 + $64 = 75 dollars in total.

So, Ryan has $82 - 75 = 7 dollars left after buying the video game.</pre>
