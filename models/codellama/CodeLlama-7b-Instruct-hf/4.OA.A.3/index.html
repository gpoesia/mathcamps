            A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

Now, let's calculate the amount of rainfall from the condition:

3.0 mm/hour x 23 hours = 79.0 mm

* Each baby animal could be photographed 21 times.
* 34 photos were spoiled and unusable out of the entire batch.
* Guests were given the opportunity to take an additional 30 photos later.

Now, let's use this information to find the total number of photos that could be taken:

1. First, let's find the total number of animals that could be seen in the two trips:

2 animals/trip x 2 trips = 4 animals

2. Next, let's find the total number of baby animals that could be seen in the two trips:

4 animals/trip x 2 trips = 8 baby animals

3. Now, let's find the total number of photos that could be taken of the baby animals:

8 baby animals x 21 photos/baby animal = 168 photos

4. Finally, let's find the total number of usable photos:

168 photos - 34 spoiled photos = 134 usable photos

So, there would be 134 usable photos in total.</pre>

            A turtle named Tommy moves at 74/37 miles per hour. If Tommy maintains his current speed for a while then slows down by 3 mph, then speeds up to his initial speed again, what would be his average speed?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's first calculate the average speed of Tommy during the period when he is maintaining his current speed:

Average speed = Total distance / Time

We know that Tommy's current speed is 74/37 miles per hour, so we can calculate the total distance he traveled during this period as follows:

Total distance = Speed x Time
= (74/37) x Time

We don't know the time, but we can assume that Tommy traveled for a long time to maintain his current speed. Let's assume that he traveled for 1 hour.

Total distance = (74/37) x 1
= 21.5 miles

Now, let's calculate the average speed during the period when Tommy slows down by 3 mph:

Average speed = Total distance / Time

We know that Tommy's speed decreased by 3 mph, so we can calculate the total distance he traveled during this period as follows:

Total distance = Speed x Time
= (74/37 - 3) x Time

We don't know the time, but we can assume that Tommy traveled for a long time to slow down. Let's assume that he traveled for 1 hour.

Total distance = (74/37 - 3) x 1
= 18.5 miles

Now, let's calculate the average speed during the period when Tommy speeds up to his initial speed again:

Average speed = Total distance / Time

We know that Tommy's speed increased by 3 mph, so we can calculate the total distance he traveled during this period as follows:

Total distance = Speed x Time
= (74/37 + 3) x Time

We don't know the time, but we can assume that Tommy traveled for a long time to speed up. Let's assume that he traveled for 1 hour.

Total distance = (74/37 + 3) x 1
= 24.5 miles

Now, let's calculate the average speed:

Average speed = (Total distance during the period when Tommy maintains his current speed + Total distance during the period when Tommy slows down by 3 mph + Total distance during the period when Tommy speeds up to his initial speed again) / (Time during the period when Tommy maintains his current speed + Time during the period when Tommy slows down by 3 mph + Time during the period when Tommy speeds up to his initial speed again)

We know that Tommy traveled for 1 hour during each of these periods, so we can calculate the average speed as follows:

Average speed = (21.5 + 18.5 + 24.5) / (1 + 1 + 1)
= 21.5 miles per hour

Therefore, Tommy's average speed during the entire period is 21.5 miles per hour.</pre>

The total snowfall in inches in City A is expected to be the product of the remaining snowfall days in City A and the average daily snowfall in inches in City B.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's first calculate the average daily snowfall in City B:

98 inches / 14 days = 7.2 inches per day

Now, let's calculate the total snowfall in City A:

Remaining snowfall days in City A = 50 - 36 = 14 days

Total snowfall in City A = Remaining snowfall days in City A x Average daily snowfall in City B
= 14 x 7.2 = 98 inches

Now, let's calculate the amount of snow that has been removed:

Average daily snowfall in City B = 7.2 inches per day

Total snow removed = Average daily snowfall in City B x Number of days that have passed
= 7.2 x 14 = 98 inches

Now, let's calculate the amount of snow left in City A:

Total snowfall in City A = 98 inches

Total snow removed = 98 inches

Amount of snow left = Total snowfall in City A - Total snow removed
= 98 - 98 = 0 inches

Therefore, there is no snow left in City A after the snow removal.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

1. The female tiger gave birth to 26 cubs in her lifetime.
2. 17 of the cubs did not survive the harsh conditions of the wild.
3. After growing up, 6 of the surviving tigers moved to other territories.

Therefore, the number of tigers that remained in the female tiger's territory is:

26 - 17 = &lt;&lt;26-17=9&gt;&gt;9

So, 9 tigers remained in the female tiger's territory.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that Jenny has 9 red colored pencils and 38 green colored pencils.

We know that the total number of pencils she has is 38 - 9 = 29.

We also know that the total number of times she used all the pencils is the product of the number of green and red pencils she has. So, we can write an equation:

(number of green pencils) x (number of red pencils) = (total number of times she used all the pencils)

We can substitute the values we know:

29 x 9 = (total number of times she used all the pencils)

Now we need to solve for the total number of times she used all the pencils. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 9:

29 x 9 = (total number of times she used all the pencils) / 9

Now we can simplify the equation:

29 = (total number of times she used all the pencils) / 9

Now we can multiply both sides of the equation by 9:

281 = (total number of times she used all the pencils)

So, the total number of times Jenny used all the pencils is 281.</pre>

* He created 28 silver and 24 gold rings.
* He subtracted the number of his original stock of silver rings.

* For a special order, he created 26 times the number of rings he had left.

Now, let's use the information to calculate the total number of rings the silversmith has:

1. The silversmith had 16 silver rings in stock.
2. He created 28 silver and 24 gold rings, which means he had 28 + 24 = 52 rings in total.
3. He subtracted the number of his original stock of silver rings, which is 16.
4. He traded some rings and ended up with 21 rings less than what he had after the creation stage, which means he had 52 - 21 = 31 rings left.
5. For a special order, he created 26 times the number of rings he had left, which means he created 26 x 31 = 806 rings.
6. He had made 7 platinum and 47 bronze rings for another order, which means he had 7 + 47 = 54 rings in total.

Now, let's add up all the rings the silversmith has:

52 + 31 + 806 + 54 = 881

19 rows x 40 flowers/row = 760 flowers

Now, let's calculate the total number of flowers in the small corners:

18 bulbs x 2 flowers/bulb = 36 flowers
48 bulbs x 2 flowers/bulb = 96 flowers

So, the total number of flowers in the small corners is 36 + 96 = 132 flowers.

The difference between the total number of flowers in the rows and the small corners is:

760 - 132 = 628 flowers

Therefore, the difference between the total number of flowers in the rows and the small corners is 628 flowers.</pre>

We know that the original mixture had 41 drops of red paint and 13 drops of white paint. When we added the same amount of red paint as before, the total number of red paint in the mixture increased by 41.

So, the total number of drops of paint in the mixture is:

41 + 13 + x = 56 + x

We also know that the sample of the mixture that we took was 34 drops. So, we can set up the equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, the factory made 32 toy cars.
* On Tuesday, the factory made 27 toy cars.
* The difference between the number of toy cars made on Monday and Tuesday is 5.
* The staff number in the factory is 12.
* Every staff member makes 9 toy cars per day.
* The total number of toy cars prepared by staff members is 45.
* On Friday, the factory prepares 31 additional toy cars.

Now, let's use the information to find the total number of toy cars made in this process:

1. First, we need to find the number of toy cars made by the staff on Monday and Tuesday. We know that the staff makes 9 toy cars per day, so the number of toy cars made by the staff on Monday and Tuesday is:

9 x 12 = 108

2. Next, we need to find the number of toy cars made by the factory on Monday and Tuesday. We know that the factory made 32 toy cars on Monday and 27 toy cars on Tuesday, so the number of toy cars made by the factory on Monday and Tuesday is:

32 + 27 = 69

3. Now, we need to find the total number of toy cars made by the factory on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. We know that the factory made 69 toy cars on Monday and Tuesday, and 31 toy cars on Friday, so the total number of toy cars made by the factory on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday is:

69 + 31 = 90

4. Finally, we need to find the total number of toy cars made in this process. We know that the factory multiplied the difference between the number of toy cars made on Monday and Tuesday by 49, so the total number of toy cars made in this process is:

90 x 49 = 4190

Therefore, the total number of toy cars made in this process is 4190.</pre>

Let's call the total number of carrots he would have harvested &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the farmer harvested 45 carrots in one day, so we can write an equation based on this information:

x = 45

We also know that for every carrot over 44, the farmer can earn 29 dollars. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

x - 44 = 29(x/44)

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 44:

44x - 44(29) = 0

44x - 1236 = 0

44x = 1236

x = 1236/44

x = 28

So, the farmer would have harvested 28 carrots in total.

To find the total amount of money he would have earned, we can multiply the number of carrots he harvested by the amount he earns for each carrot over 44:

28 x 29 = 776

So, the farmer would have earned 776 dollars.</pre>

* 23 sharks are moved to a different area of the aquarium.
* 14 sharks are brought in.
* 3 more sharks are moved to the other area.
* The number of sharks is then multiplied by 43 for a research study.

We can start by using the information given to find the total number of sharks in the aquarium:

30 - 23 = 7
7 + 14 = 21
21 + 3 = 24

So, there are 24 sharks in the aquarium.

Next, we need to find the number of sharks in the other area of the aquarium. We know that 23 sharks were moved to this area, so we can find the number of sharks in this area by subtracting the number of sharks in the aquarium from the total number of sharks:

24 - 23 = 1

So, there is 1 shark in the other area of the aquarium.

Now, we need to find the total number of sharks after the additional 14 sharks are brought in. We can do this by adding the number of sharks in the aquarium and the number of sharks in the other area:

24 + 1 = 25

So, there are 25 sharks in the aquarium after the additional 14 sharks are brought in.

Finally, we need to find the total number of sharks after the number of sharks is multiplied by 43 for the research study. We can do this by multiplying the total number of sharks by 43:

            A wizard casts a spell that produces 882 glimmering lights over a span of 21 days. That's an average of how many lights a day?

In comparison, another wizard casts a spell that produces 460 glowing orbs in 20 days. What is the daily average here?

Now, let's assume that the difference in their daily averages times the second wizard's daily average is a magical constant represented by 'n'. Can you find out what 'n' is?

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the average number of lights produced per day by the first wizard, we can divide the total number of lights produced (882) by the number of days (21):

882 lights / 21 days = 41.9 lights per day

To find the average number of glowing orbs produced per day by the second wizard, we can divide the total number of orbs produced (460) by the number of days (20):

460 orbs / 20 days = 23 orbs per day

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the difference in their daily averages times the second wizard's daily average:

(41.9 - 23) \* 23 = n

Simplifying the equation:

(28.9) \* 23 = n

n = 677

So, the magical constant 'n' is equal to 677.</pre>

On one particular day, the distance was 36 million kilometers but decreased by 19 million kilometers later in the month. Then it increased again by 11 million kilometers. If that distance, in millions of kilometers, times 19 minus 27 equals to a certain value, what is the value?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the distance between the Moon and the Earth &quot;d&quot; in millions of kilometers.

We know that the distance decreased by 19 million kilometers later in the month, so we can write:

d - 19 = x

We also know that the distance increased again by 11 million kilometers later in the month, so we can write:

d + 11 = y

We are given that the product of the distance in millions of kilometers times 19 minus 27 equals a certain value. We can write:

(d \* 19) - 27 = z

We can substitute the expressions for d and y into the last equation:

(x \* 19) - 27 = z

We can solve for x and y:

x = d - 19
y = d + 11

Now we can substitute the expressions for x and y into the last equation:

((d - 19) \* 19) - 27 = z

We can simplify:

(d \* 19) - 27 = z

We are given that z = 36. We can solve for d:

d = (z + 27) / 19

d = 36 / 19

d = 2

So the distance between the Moon and the Earth is 2 million kilometers.</pre>

Now, let's calculate the distance covered by the second tiger:

1. The second tiger took a 23-meter run and then leaped 46 meters, so the total distance covered by the second tiger is:
23 meters + 46 meters = 69 meters
2. The second tiger then retraced the distance equal to the first tiger's steps and the leap, so the total distance covered by the second tiger is:

            A treasure chest contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds. Unfortunately, 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed. The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest. 

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

What is the value (m) of the remaining treasure?

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the value of the remaining treasure, we need to follow the instructions given in the problem.

First, we need to find the value of the first chest. We know that the number of real stones left is y, and the value of the chest is g. We can find g by multiplying y by itself and then subtracting 37:

g = y^2 - 37

Next, we need to find the value of the second chest. We know that the number of rubies is x, and the value of the chest is m. We can find m by subtracting 3 from the number of rubies:

m = x - 3

Finally, we need to find the value of the remaining treasure. We know that the value of the first chest is g, and the value of the second chest is m. We can find the value of the remaining treasure by subtracting the value of the first chest from the value of the second chest:

m - g = x - 3 - (y^2 - 37)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

m - g = x - 3 - y^2 + 37

Solving for m, we get:

m = x - 3 - y^2 + 37 + g

Substituting the values we know, we get:

m = 540 - 3 - (y^2 - 37) + g

Simplifying this equation, we get:

m = 540 - 3 - y^2 + 37 + y^2 - 37

Simplifying further, we get:

m = 540 - 3 - 2y^2 + 74

Therefore, the value of the remaining treasure is 540 - 3 - 2y^2 + 74.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's start by using the information that Sam had 48 dollars and gave some money to Ellen. We can write this as:

Sam had 48 dollars - x dollars

where x is the amount of money that Sam gave to Ellen.

We know that Sam had 48 dollars and gave some money to Ellen, so we can say that x is a positive number. Let's call x &quot;d&quot;.

We also know that Sam had 48 dollars and gave d dollars to Ellen, so we can say that Sam had 48 - d dollars.

Now, we are given that Sam got 24 dollars from his brother. We can write this as:

Sam had 48 - d dollars - 24 dollars

We can simplify this by combining the two expressions:

Sam had 48 - d dollars - 24 dollars = 24 - d dollars

We can see that Sam had 24 - d dollars.

So, we have two equations:

Sam had 48 dollars - x dollars
Sam had 24 - d dollars

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of d.

First, we can solve the first equation for x:

x = 48 - d

Now, we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation:

24 - d = 48 - d

We can simplify this by combining the two expressions:

24 - d = 48 - d

We can see that 24 - d = 48 - d, which means that d = 24.

So, Sam had 24 dollars.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's first calculate the total number of days the hiker had to travel:

36 days x 900 miles/day = 32,400 miles

Now, let's calculate the number of days the hiker saved by increasing his daily average to 16 miles:

36 days x 16 miles/day = 576 miles

So, the hiker saved 32,400 - 576 = 31,824 miles.

Next, let's calculate the number of days the hiker saved by finding a shortcut:

4 days x 16 miles/day = 64 miles

So, the hiker saved 31,824 - 64 = 31,760 miles.

Finally, let's calculate the number of days the hiker saved by following the friendly traveller's advice:

40 days x 16 miles/day = 640 miles

So, the hiker saved 31,760 - 640 = 31,120 miles.

Additionally, the hiker saved 21 days due to good weather, so the total number of days saved is:

31,120 + 21 = 31,331 days

Therefore, the hiker saved a total of 31,331 days on his journey.</pre>

            The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Sure, I can help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock.

First, let's start with the number of squares needed for the hours:

37 hours x 1 square per hour = 37 squares

Next, let's add the number of squares needed for the minutes:

25 minutes x 1 square per minute = 25 squares

Now, let's add the number of squares needed for the seconds:

28 seconds x 1 square per second = 28 squares

Finally, let's subtract the number of squares needed for the total number of squares:

37 + 25 + 28 - 23 = 67 squares

So, your friend would need 67 squares in total to complete their quirky clock.</pre>

            An orange farm produced 2 times the 28 pounds of oranges they typically produce in a single day due to a new method. This production also multiplied by the 15 days of the harvest period. If the farm then added 16 pounds of a rare orange variant to this harvest, how much did the farm produce in total?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's first calculate the total production of the farm in a single day:

28 pounds of oranges x 2 = 56 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total production over the 15-day harvest period:

56 pounds/day x 15 days = 820 pounds

Now, let's add the 16 pounds of rare oranges to the total production:

820 pounds + 16 pounds = 836 pounds

Therefore, the farm produced a total of 836 pounds of oranges.</pre>

            A bus has 37 passengers. At the next stop, 20 more passengers get on. Before the bus reaches to the next stop, 44 passengers get off. Now, suppose this remaining number of passengers each pays an $11 fare, but the bus company also deducts a $14 service fee from the total fare. How much revenue does the bus company get?

37 + 20 = 57

Now, let's calculate the number of passengers who get off the bus:

Now, let's calculate the total fare for all the passengers:

13 x $11 = $143

Now, let's calculate the total revenue for the bus company:

$143 - $14 = $139

11 + 10 = 21

So, the turtle swam a total distance of 336 leagues that week.

Now, let's find the real distance the turtle swam that week by subtracting the overcalculation of 41 leagues.

336 - 41 = 395
