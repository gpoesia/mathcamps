            Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121

We can solve for q by solving the first equation for s and then substituting that value into the second equation.

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121

Substituting s = 40/91q into the second equation, we get:

2. (30 * (40/91q)) + (12 * q) = 121

Simplifying, we get:

2. 30/91q + 12q = 121

Subtracting 12q from both sides, we get:

2. 30/91q = 109

Dividing both sides by 30/91, we get:

2. q = 109/30

Now that we have the value of q, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for s.

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121

Substituting q = 109/30 into the first equation, we get:

1. (40 * s) - (91 * (109/30)) = 37

Simplifying, we get:

1. 40s - 9109/30 = 37

Dividing both sides by 9109/30, we get:

1. s = 40/91

Therefore, the values of q and s are q = 109/30 and s = 40/91.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can first add the two equations to get:

4 * b + 44 * m = 180
79 * m - 6 * b = 48

Adding the two equations, we get:

4 * b + 79 * m = 228

Subtracting 44 * m from both sides, we get:

4 * b - 79 * m = 184

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

b - 19.5 * m = 42

Now, we can solve for b and m separately.

For b, we have:

b = 42 + 19.5 * m

For m, we have:

m = (b - 42) / 19.5

Substituting the expression for b in terms of m, we get:

m = (42 + 19.5 * m) / 19.5

Simplifying, we get:

m = 2

Therefore, the values of b and m are b = 42 and m = 2.</pre>

42 * o - 15 * g + 47 * o + 29 * g = 28 + 141

This simplifies to:

69 * o + 46 * g = 169

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 69 to get:

o + g = 2.46

Since we want to find the values of o and g, we can set up the equation:

o + g = 2.46

and solve for o and g separately.

o = 2.46 - g

Now, we can substitute this expression for o into the second equation:

47 * (2.46 - g) + 29 * g = 141

This simplifies to:

47 * 2.46 - 47 * g + 29 * g = 141

This simplifies to:

47 * 2.46 = 116.42

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 47 to get:

2.46 = 116.42 / 47

This simplifies to:

g = 2.46 / 47

Now, we can substitute this expression for g into the first equation:

o + g = 2.46

This simplifies to:

o = 2.46 - g

Now, we can substitute this expression for o into the first equation:

2.46 - g + g = 2.46

This simplifies to:

o = 2.46

Now, we have found the values of o and g:

o = 2.46
g = 2.46 / 47

Therefore, the values of o and g are 2.46 and 0.52, respectively.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to find the values of v and o that satisfy both equations.

First, let's solve the first equation for v:

v = (21 + 6o) / 12

Now, substitute this expression for v into the second equation:

((76 * (21 + 6o) / 12) - (45 * o)) = 50

Expand and simplify:

(172 + 42o) - 45o = 50

Combine like terms:

127o = 5

Now, divide both sides by 127 to find o:

o = 5 / 127

Now that we have the value of o, we can substitute it into the first equation to find the value of v:

v = (21 + 6o) / 12
= (21 + 6(5/127)) / 12
= (21 + 3) / 12

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can first solve the first equation for f:

75 * f + 25 * g = 138

Subtracting 25 * g from both sides gives us:

50 * f = 138 - 25 * g

Dividing both sides by 50 gives us:

f = (138 - 25 * g) / 50

Now, substitute this expression for f into the second equation:

2 * (f) + 90 * g = 143

Expanding and simplifying gives us:

2 * ((138 - 25 * g) / 50) + 90 * g = 143

Expanding and simplifying gives us:

138 - 25 * g + 180 * g = 143

Subtracting 180 * g from both sides gives us:

-65 * g = 10

Dividing both sides by -65 gives us:

g = -10 / 65

Now, substitute this expression for g into the first equation:

75 * f + 25 * (-10 / 65) = 138

Expanding and simplifying gives us:

75 * f - 10 = 138

Dividing both sides by 75 gives us:

f = 138 / 75

Therefore, the values of f and g are:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can first solve the second equation for y:

7 = 65n - 79y

We can then substitute this expression for y into the first equation:

194 = 4(65n - 79y) + 14n

Now, we can solve for n:

194 = 4(65n) + 14n - 79y

Subtracting 4(65n) from both sides gives us:

194 - 4(65n) = 14n - 79y

Simplifying, we get:

150n = 14n - 79y

Subtracting 14n from both sides gives us:

136n = -79y

Dividing both sides by -79 gives us:

n = -y/79

Now, we can substitute this expression for n into the first equation:

194 = 4(-y/79) + 14(-y/79)

Simplifying, we get:

194 = -y/79 + 14/79

Adding 14/79 to both sides gives us:

194 + 14/79 = -y/79

Simplifying, we get:

194 + 14/79 = -y/79 + 14/79

Combining like terms, we get:

194 + 14/79 = 0

Subtracting 14/79 from both sides gives us:

170/79 = -y/79

Dividing both sides by -y/79 gives us:

79 = -y

Substituting this expression for y into the first equation, we get:

194 = 4(-y) + 14(-y)

Simplifying, we get:

194 = -4y + 14y

Adding 4y to both sides gives us:

194 + 4y = 14y

Subtracting 14y from both sides gives us:

170 = 4y

Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:

40 = y

Therefore, the value of y is 40.

Now, we can substitute this expression for y into the second equation:

7 = 65n - 79(40)

Simplifying, we get:

7 = 65n - 3240

Dividing both sides by 65 gives us:

n = 11.2

Therefore, the value of n is 11.2.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the values of l and g that satisfy these two equations, we can start by solving the first equation for g:

146 = 28 * g + 26 * l

Subtracting 26 * l from both sides gives us:

28 * g = 146 - 26 * l

Dividing both sides by 28 gives us:

g = (146 - 26 * l) / 28

Now, we can substitute this expression for g into the second equation:

6 = 41 * l - 53 * (146 - 26 * l) / 28

Simplifying this equation gives us:

6 = 41 * l - 53 * g

Subtracting 53 * g from both sides gives us:

41 * l = 6 + 53 * g

Dividing both sides by 41 gives us:

l = (6 + 53 * g) / 41

Now, we can substitute this expression for l into the first equation:

146 = 28 * g + 26 * (6 + 53 * g) / 41

Simplifying this equation gives us:

146 = 28 * g + 26 * (6 + 53 * g) / 41

Subtracting 26 * (6 + 53 * g) / 41 from both sides gives us:

28 * g = 146 - 26 * (6 + 53 * g) / 41

Dividing both sides by 28 gives us:

g = (146 - 26 * (6 + 53 * g) / 41) / 28

Now, we can substitute this expression for g into the second equation:

6 = 41 * l - 53 * (146 - 26 * (6 + 53 * g) / 41) / 28

Simplifying this equation gives us:

6 = 41 * l - 53 * g

Subtracting 53 * g from both sides gives us:

41 * l = 6 + 53 * g

Dividing both sides by 41 gives us:

l = (6 + 53 * g) / 41

Now, we have found the values of l and g that satisfy both equations. Substituting these values into the first equation gives us:

146 = 28 * g + 26 * (6 + 53 * g) / 41

Simplifying this equation gives us:

146 = 28 * g + 26 * (6 + 53 * g) / 41

Subtracting 26 * (6 + 53 * g) / 41 from both sides gives us:

28 * g = 146 - 26 * (6 + 53 * g) / 41

Dividing both sides by 28 gives us:

g = (146 - 26 * (6 + 53 * g) / 41) / 28

Now, we have found the values of l and g that satisfy both equations.

890 - 56y + 7y = 98

890 - 56y = 91

56y = 890 - 91

y = 890 / 56

Now, we can find the value of p:

Dividing both sides by 83, we get:

h = 15

Now, we can substitute the value of h into the first equation to get:

Subtracting 33 * d from both sides, we get:

Dividing both sides by 49, we get:

d = 2

Now, we can substitute the value of d into the second equation to get:

10 * 2 + 14 * 15 = 91

Simplifying, we get:

28 + 210 = 238

Subtracting 210 from both sides, we get:

53 = ((89 * r) - (74 * a))

We can solve for r by adding 74a to both sides:

53 + 74a = (89 * r)

Now, we can divide both sides by 89:

(53 + 74a) / 89 = r

Now, we can solve for r by multiplying both sides by 89:

r = (53 + 74a) / 89

Now, we can substitute the value of a from the second equation into the first equation:

r = (53 + 74(37)) / 89

Now, we can simplify the expression:

r = (53 + 2,610) / 89

Now, we can simplify the expression further:

r = 30 / 89

Now, we can simplify the expression further:

r = 0.33

Now, we can substitute the value of r into the first equation:

a = (53 - 74(0.33)) / 37

Now, we can simplify the expression:

a = (53 - 24.95) / 37

Now, we can simplify the expression further:

Now, we can simplify the expression further:

a = 4

Therefore, the values of r and a are 0.33 and 4, respectively.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can first solve the first equation for 'v' and then substitute that value into the second equation to solve for 'd'.

First, solve the first equation for 'v':

25x + 69y = 113

Now, solve for 'y' in the second equation:

26x + 42y = 85

Now, substitute the value of 'y' from the first equation into the second equation:

26x + 42(25x + 69y) = 85

Simplify the equation:

26x + 1125x + 3269y = 85

Combine like terms:

3994x + 3269y = 85

Now, solve for 'x' and 'y':

3994x = 85 - 3269y

x = 85 - 3269y / 3994

y = (85 - 3994x) / 3269

Now, we have the values of 'x' and 'y':

x = 85 - 3269y / 3994
y = (85 - 3994x) / 3269

Therefore, the values of 'd' and 'v' are:

d = y = (85 - 3994x) / 3269
v = x = 85 - 3269y / 3994

So, the values of 'd' and 'v' are:

d = (85 - 3269y) / 3269
v = (85 - 3994x) / 3994

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve these equations, we can first add the two equations together to get:

43 * z - 91 * g = 33
72 * g - 3 * z = 68

43 * z - 91 * g + 72 * g - 3 * z = 33 + 68

This simplifies to:

115 * z = 101

Now, we can divide both sides by 115 to solve for z:

z = 101 / 115

Now, we can substitute this value of z into one of the original equations to solve for g:

43 * z - 91 * g = 33

Substituting z = 101 / 115, we get:

43 * (101 / 115) - 91 * g = 33

Simplifying, we get:

43 - 91 * g = 33

Now, we can divide both sides by -91 to solve for g:

g = -43 / 91

Now, we can substitute this value of g into one of the original equations to solve for z:

72 * g - 3 * z = 68

Substituting g = -43 / 91, we get:

72 * (-43 / 91) - 3 * z = 68

Simplifying, we get:

-282 - 3 * z = 68

Now, we can add 3 * z to both sides to get:

-282 + 3 * z = 68 + 3 * z

Now, we can simplify by combining like terms:

-282 + 3 * z = 101

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for z:

-282 / 3 + z = 101 / 3

Now, we can simplify by combining like terms:

-92 + z = 34

Now, we can subtract 34 from both sides to solve for z:

-92 + z - 34 = 0

Now, we can simplify by combining like terms:

-126 = 0

Now, we can divide both sides by -126 to solve for z:

1 / -126 = 0

Now, we can simplify by combining like terms:

z = 0

Therefore, the values of g and z are:

g = -43 / 91
z = 0</pre>

            Alex's and Brad's baskets contained c cherries and f figs respectively. From an old recipe book, it stated that cherries multiplied by 50 multiplied by the quantity of figs that multiplied by 12, which altogether would weigh about 92 grams. Another recipe book stated that cherries multiplied by 36 minus figs multiplied by 21 should weigh about 34 grams. Can you find the quantity of cherries (c) and figs (f)? Use the following system of equations to solve:

50c + 12f = 92
36c - 21f = 34.

50c + 12f = 92
36c - 21f = 34

Adding the two equations, we get:

86c = 126

Dividing both sides by 86, we get:

c = 126/86

c = 1.4

Now, we can substitute the value of c into one of the original equations to solve for f. For example, we can substitute c = 1.4 into the first equation:

50(1.4) + 12f = 92

Simplifying, we get:

68 + 12f = 92

Subtracting 68 from both sides, we get:

12f = 24

Dividing both sides by 12, we get:

f = 2

Therefore, the quantity of cherries (c) is 1.4 and the quantity of figs (f) is 2.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to find the values of u and d that satisfy both equations.

First, let's solve the first equation for u:

87u - 75d = 7

We can add 75d to both sides of the equation to get:

87u = 7 + 75d

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 87 to get:

u = (7 + 75d) / 87

Now, let's substitute the expression for u into the second equation:

85d - 82u = 54

We can substitute the expression for u into the second equation to get:

85d - 82(7 + 75d) / 87 = 54

Now, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 87:

85d - 82(7 + 75d) = 54(87)

Now, we can simplify the equation further by combining the like terms:

85d - 82(7 + 75d) = 54(87)

Now, we can solve for d by subtracting 82(7 + 75d) from both sides of the equation:

85d - 82(7 + 75d) = 54(87)

85d - 82(7 + 75d) - 82(7 + 75d) = 54(87)

85d - 82(7 + 75d) - 82(7 + 75d) = 54(87)

85d - 82(7 + 75d) - 82(7 + 75d) - 82(7 + 75d) = 54(87)

85d - 82(7 + 75d) - 82(7 + 75d) - 82(7 + 75d) - 82(7 + 75d) = 54(87)

85d - 82(7 + 75d) - 82(7 + 75d) - 82(7 + 75d) - 82(7 + 75d) - 82(7 + 75d) = 54(87)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can help Bill decipher the secret code.

From the first equation, we can see that:

(75 * a) - (4 * i) = 42

We can simplify this equation by combining the like terms:

75a - 4i = 42

Now, we can solve for a by adding 4i to both sides of the equation:

75a = 42 + 4i

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 75 to solve for a:

a = (42 + 4i) / 75

a = 5.5

Now, we can substitute the value of a into the second equation:

(10 * i) + (13 * 5.5) = 160

We can simplify this equation by combining the like terms:

10i + 13(5.5) = 160

Now, we can solve for i by subtracting 13(5.5) from both sides of the equation:

10i = 160 - 77

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10 to solve for i:

i = (160 - 77) / 10

i = 8.3

Therefore, the values of i and a for Bill are i = 8.3 and a = 5.5.</pre>

c = 32

From the first equation, we can solve for v:

v = 14 + 69f

Now, substitute this expression for v into the second equation:

Expand and simplify:

46f + 69fv + 14v = 110

Combine like terms:

115f + 14v = 110

Subtract 14v from both sides:

Divide both sides by 115:

f = 10/115

Now, substitute this expression for f into the first equation:

75(10/115) - 69f = 14

Expand and simplify:

75/115 - 69(10/115) = 14/115

Simplify:

75/115 - 69/115 = 14/115

Simplify:

66/115 = 14/115

Divide both sides by 66/115:

115/66 = 14/115

Divide both sides by 115:

1/66 = 14/115

Divide both sides by 14/115:

1/66 = 1

Multiply both sides by 66:

y = (221 - 24 * z) / 72

Now, we can substitute the value of y into the second equation to solve for z:

2 * z + 82 * (y) = 96

Substituting the expression for y, we get:

2 * z + 82 * ((221 - 24 * z) / 72) = 96

Simplifying and solving for z, we get:

z = (96 - 2 * y) / 82

Substituting the expression for y, we get:

z = (96 - 2 * ((221 - 24 * z) / 72)) / 82

Simplifying and solving for z, we get:

z = (96 - 2 * (221 - 24 * z)) / 82

Simplifying further, we get:

z = (96 - 2 * 24 * z) / 82

Simplifying further, we get:

z = 96 / 82 - 2 * z

Simplifying further, we get:

z = 96 / 82 - 2 * (96 / 82)

Simplifying further, we get:

z = 96 / 82 - 96 / 82

Simplifying further, we get:

z = 0

Therefore, the values of y and z are:

y = (221 - 24 * z) / 72 = (221 - 0) / 72 = 3

z = 0

So, the values of y and z are 3 and 0, respectively.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can first add the two equations to get:

(87 * o) - (29 * v) + (8 * v) + (30 * o) = 1 + 91

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(87 + 30) * o - (29 + 8) * v = 100

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by (87 + 30) to get:

o = (100 / (87 + 30))

Substituting this value of o into the first equation, we get:

v = (100 / (87 + 30)) - (29 / (87 + 30))

Simplifying the expression, we get:

v = (100 / 117) - (29 / 117)

v = 8 / 117 - 29 / 117

v = -21 / 117

Therefore, the value of v is -21/117.

Now, we can substitute this value of v into the second equation to find the value of o:

o = (91 / 8) - (30 / 8) * (-21 / 117)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

o = (91 / 8) - (63 / 117)

o = 15 / 117

Therefore, the value of o is 15/117.

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is v = -21/117 and o = 15/117.</pre>

            If the following system of equations represents the relationship between integers d and f, determine their values:
1) 19d + 6f = 120, 
2) 90d - 42f = 69.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to find the values of d and f that satisfy both equations.

First, we can solve the first equation for d:

19d + 6f = 120

Subtracting 6f from both sides gives us:

19d = 120 - 6f

Dividing both sides by 19 gives us:

d = (120 - 6f) / 19

Now, we can substitute this expression for d into the second equation:

90(d) - 42f = 69

Substituting the expression for d gives us:

90(d) - 42f = 69

Subtracting 42f from both sides gives us:

90d - 42f = 69 - 42f

Subtracting 42f from both sides gives us:

90d = 69

Dividing both sides by 90 gives us:

d = 69 / 90

Now, we can substitute this expression for d into the first equation:

19(69/90) + 6f = 120

Simplifying gives us:

19(69/90) + 6f = 120

19(69/90) = 120 - 6f

19(69/90) = 120 - 6f

Dividing both sides by 19 gives us:

69/90 = (120 - 6f) / 19

Simplifying gives us:

69/90 = 120 / 19 - f/19

Now, we can substitute this expression for f into the second equation:

90(d) - 42(120 / 19 - f/19) = 69

Simplifying gives us:

90(d) - 42(120 / 19 - f/19) = 69

90d - 42(120 / 19 - f/19) = 69

90d - 42(120 / 19 - f/19) = 69

Subtracting 42(120 / 19 - f/19) from both sides gives us:

90d = 69

Dividing both sides by 90 gives us:

d = 69 / 90

Now, we can substitute this expression for d into the first equation:

19(69/90) + 6(69/90) = 120

Simplifying gives us:

19(69/90) + 6(69/90) = 120

19(69/90) + 6(69/90) = 120

Adding 19(69/90) and 6(69/90) gives us:

19(69/90) + 6(69/90) = 120

19(69/90) + 6(69/90) = 120

Dividing both sides by 19 gives us:

69/90 = (120 - 6(69/90)) / 19

Simplifying gives us:

69/90 = 120 / 19 - 6(69/90) / 19

Now, we can substitute this expression for f into the second equation:

90(d) - 42(120 / 19 - f/19) = 69

Substituting the expression for f gives us:

90(d) - 42(120 / 19 - f/19) = 69

90d - 42(120 / 19 - f/19) = 69

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Yes, I can solve this system of linear equations. To do so, I will use substitution or elimination method.

Let's start by solving the first equation for 'm':

1) 42 * m + 55 * r = 127

We can solve for 'm' by subtracting 55*r from both sides:

1) 42 * m = 127 - 55 * r

Now, let's substitute the expression for 'm' in the second equation:

2) 66 * (127 - 55 * r) - 52 * r = 44

We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation:

2) 66 * 127 - 66 * 55 * r - 52 * r = 44

Now, we can solve for 'r':

2) 66 * 127 - 3470 * r - 52 * r = 44

We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation:

2) 66 * 127 - 3990 * r = 44

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 66:

2) 127 - 5990/66 * r = 44/66

Now, we can solve for 'r':

2) 127 - 93 * r = 44/66

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 93:

2) 127/93 - r = 44/66/93

Now, we can solve for 'r':

2) r = (44/66/93) - 127/93

Now, we can simplify the expression:

2) r = -127/93

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'r' in the first equation:

1) 42 * m + 55 * (-127/93) = 127

Now, we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation:

1) 42 * m - 6615/93 = 127

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 42:

1) m - 1615/186 = 127/42

Now, we can solve for 'm':

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can simplify the expression:

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can solve for 'm':

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can simplify the expression:

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can solve for 'm':

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can simplify the expression:

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can solve for 'm':

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can simplify the expression:

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can solve for 'm':

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can simplify the expression:

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can solve for 'm':

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can simplify the expression:

1) m = 127/42 + 1615/186

Now, we can solve for 'm':

Now, substitute this expression for a into the second equation:

76u - 77(a) = 76u - 77((112 - 26u) / 72)

Expand and simplify:

76u - 77(112 - 26u) = 76u - 77(72)

76u - 77(72) = 76u - 5,888

76u = 5,888 + 77(72)

76u = 5,888 + 5,648

u = 1,136

Now, substitute u = 1,136 into the first equation:

            Consider the following pair of linear equations. 

First equation: ((18 * p) - (7 * s)) = 21

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of linear equations, we can add the two equations to get:

((18 * p) - (7 * s)) + ((51 * s) - (24 * p)) = 21 + 14

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

(18 * p) + (51 * s) = 95

Subtracting 24 * p from both sides, we get:

(18 * p) - 24 * p = 95 - 24 * p

Simplifying, we get:

18 * p = 71

Dividing both sides by 18, we get:

p = 71/18

Now, we can substitute the value of p into one of the original equations to find the value of s. For example, we can substitute p = 71/18 into the first equation:

((18 * (71/18)) - (7 * s)) = 21

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

(71 - 7 * s) = 21

Subtracting 7 * s from both sides, we get:

64 - 7 * s = 21

Subtracting 7 * s from both sides again, we get:

57 = 21

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

s = 57/7

Therefore, the values of p and s that satisfy both equations are p = 71/18 and s = 57/7.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can first solve the first equation for f:

45 * f + 42 * z = 101

Subtract 42 * z from both sides:

45 * f = 101 - 42 * z

Divide both sides by 45:

f = (101 - 42 * z) / 45

Now, substitute the expression for f into the second equation:

60 * z - 42 * (f) = 13

Expand the right-hand side:

60 * z - 42 * (101 - 42 * z) / 45 = 13

Simplify:

60 * z - 42 * 101 + 42 * z = 13

Add 42 * z to both sides:

60 * z = 13 + 42 * z

Subtract 13 from both sides:

48 * z = 13

Divide both sides by 48:

z = 13 / 48

Now, substitute the expression for z into the first equation:

45 * f + 42 * 13 / 48 = 101

Expand the right-hand side:

45 * f + 42 * 13 = 101

Simplify:

45 * f = 101 - 42 * 13

Divide both sides by 45:

f = (101 - 42 * 13) / 45

Now, we have the values of f and z:

f = (101 - 42 * 13) / 45
z = 13 / 48

Therefore, the values of f and z are:

f = 2.17

87*z - 35*e = 63
81*z + 58*e = 154

Adding the two equations, we get:

168*z = 211

Now, dividing both sides by 168, we get:

z = 14

Now, substituting z = 14 into the first equation, we get:

87*14 - 35*e = 63

Substituting e = 14 - 87/35, we get:

e = 14 - 87/35

Now, substituting e = 14 - 87/35 into the second equation, we get:

Simplifying, we get:

33 + (14 - 87/35) = 154/58

Now, simplifying further, we get:

33 + 14 - 87/35 = 154/58

Now, simplifying further, we get:

47 - 87/35 = 154/58

Now, simplifying further, we get:

47 - 21 = 154/58

Now, simplifying further, we get:

26 = 154/58

Now, dividing both sides by 154, we get:

26/154 = 1

Now, simplifying, we get:

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 120 to get:

b + o = 140/120

Simplifying further, we get:

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by b to get:

So, the values of b and o are:

b = 1.2 - o

Substituting this expression for b into the first equation, we get:

            Find the values of k and f that satisfy the following system of equations: 10 * k + 48 * f = 161
33 * k - 41 * f = 31.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to solve the two equations simultaneously.

First, let's solve the first equation for k:

10k + 48f = 161

Subtracting 48f from both sides gives us:

10k = 161 - 48f

Dividing both sides by 10 gives us:

k = (161 - 48f) / 10

Now, let's substitute this expression for k into the second equation:

33k - 41f = 31

Substituting the expression for k into the second equation gives us:

(161 - 48f) / 10 - 41f = 31

Simplifying this expression gives us:

f = (161 - 48f) / 41

Now, we can solve for f by dividing both sides by 41:

f = (161 - 48f) / 41 / 41

Simplifying this expression gives us:

f = (161 - 48f) / 41

Now, we can solve for f by subtracting f from both sides:

f = 161 - 48f - 41

Simplifying this expression gives us:

f = 161 - 48f - 41

Now, we can solve for f by adding 41 to both sides:

f = 161 - 48f

Now, we can solve for f by subtracting 48f from both sides:

f = 161 - 48f - 48f

Simplifying this expression gives us:

f = 161 - 48f - 48f

Now, we can solve for f by adding 48f to both sides:

f = 161 - 48f

Now, we can solve for f by subtracting 161 from both sides:

f = -48f

Now, we can solve for f by dividing both sides by -48:

f = 1/48

Now, we can solve for k by substituting the expression for f into the first equation:

10k + 48(1/48) = 161

Simplifying this expression gives us:

10k = 161 - 48

Dividing both sides by 10 gives us:

k = (161 - 48) / 10

Now, we can solve for k by substituting the expression for k into the second equation:

33(k) - 41(1/48) = 31

Simplifying this expression gives us:

33k - 41 = 31

Now, we can solve for k by adding 41 to both sides:

33k = 31 + 41

Simplifying this expression gives us:

33k = 72

Now, we can solve for k by dividing both sides by 33:

k = 72 / 33

Now, we can solve for k by substituting the expression for k into the first equation:

10k + 48(1/48) = 161

Simplifying this expression gives us:

10k = 161 - 48

Dividing both sides by 10 gives us:

k = (161 - 48) / 10

Now, we can solve for k by substituting the expression for k into the second equation:

33k - 41(1/48) = 31

Simplifying this expression gives us:

33k - 41 = 31

Now, we can solve for k by adding 41 to both sides:

33k = 31 + 41

Simplifying this expression gives us:

33k = 72

Now, we can solve for k by dividing both sides by 33:

n = 31 + 778

n = 809

29y - 28j = 39
25y + 37j = 116

Adding the two equations, we get:

54y = 155

Dividing both sides by 54, we get:

y = 155/54

Now, we can substitute this value of y into one of the original equations to find the value of j. For example, we can substitute y = 155/54 into the first equation:

29(155/54) - 28j = 39

Simplifying, we get:

29(155/54) - 28j = 39

Dividing both sides by 29, we get:

155/54 - 28j = 39/29

Dividing both sides by 155/54, we get:

1 - 28j = 39/29

Multiplying both sides by 54, we get:

-28j = 117

Dividing both sides by -28, we get:

j = -4

Therefore, the values of y and j that satisfy the system of equations are y = 155/54 and j = -4.</pre>

96u + 17a = 186

Adding the two equations, we get:

Dividing both sides by 189, we get:

u = 260/189

Now, we can substitute this value of u into the first equation to get:

93(260/189) - 85a = 74

Simplifying, we get:

260 - 85a = 74

Now, we can divide both sides by 85 to get:

a = 260/85

Now, we can substitute this value of a into the second equation to get:

96(260/189) + 17(260/85) = 186

Simplifying, we get:

260 + 410 = 186

Now, we can subtract 410 from both sides to get:

Now, we can divide both sides by 260 to get:

1 = 145/260

Now, we can divide both sides by 145 to get:

u = 260/189
a = 260/85

So, the values of u and a are 260/189 and 260/85, respectively.</pre>

Now, we can divide both sides by 100 to solve for r:

r = 3.8

1) 75u - 69q = 5

To solve for u, we can add 69q to both sides of the equation:

1) 75u = 5 + 69q

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 75 to solve for u:

1) u = (5 + 69q) / 75

Now, we can substitute the expression for u into the second equation:

2) 48u + 25q = 140

To solve for q, we can first simplify the left-hand side of the equation:

2) 48u + 25q = 140

Next, we can subtract 48u from both sides of the equation:

2) 25q = 140 - 48u

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 25 to solve for q:

2) q = (140 - 48u) / 25

Now, we can substitute the expression for q into the first equation:

Now, we can substitute the expression for q into the first equation:

1) u = (5 + 69(q)) / 75

Now, we can simplify the expression for u:

1) u = (5 + 475q) / 75

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to solve the two equations simultaneously.

First, let's solve the first equation for c:

6c + 55o = 112

Subtracting 55o from both sides gives us:

6c = 112 - 55o

Now, let's solve the second equation for o:

55c - 48o = 36

Adding 48o to both sides gives us:

55c = 36 + 48o

Now, we can substitute the expression we got for c in terms of o into the second equation:

55(112 - 55o) = 36 + 48o

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

6760 - 3475o = 36 + 48o

Subtracting 3475o from both sides gives us:

3285 = 48o

Now, we can divide both sides by 48 to solve for o:

o = 3285/48

o = 67

Now, we can substitute the value of o into the first equation to solve for c:

6c + 55(67) = 112

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

6c + 4075 = 112

Subtracting 4075 from both sides gives us:

6c = 112 - 4075

6c = -3910

Now, we can divide both sides by -6 to solve for c:

c = -3910/6

c = -645

Therefore, the values of c and o that satisfy the system of equations are c = -645 and o = 67.</pre>

8w + 68u = 170
71w - 94u = 8

Adding the two equations, we get:

8w + 68u = 170
71w - 94u = 8

8w + 68u + 71w - 94u = 170 + 8

159w = 258

Now, we can divide both sides by 159 to solve for w:

w = 258/159

Now, we can substitute the value of w into one of the original equations to solve for u:

8w + 68u = 170

Substituting w = 258/159, we get:

8(258/159) + 68u = 170

Simplifying, we get:

204 + 68u = 170

Subtracting 68u from both sides, we get:

Now, we can divide both sides by 82 to solve for u:

u = 136/82

Therefore, the values of u and w that satisfy the system of equations are u = 136/82 and w = 258/159.</pre>

            Given the equations below, find the values of r and d:

For the first equation, consider 67 apples, each worth d dollars, and 37 ragdolls, each worth r dollars. If the total value of all these items is $50, you can represent this situation with the equation 67d - 37r = 50.

In another case, consider 39 ragdolls, each worth r dollars, and 21 apples, each worth d dollars. If the total value of all these items is $16, you can also represent this situation with the equation 39r - 21d = 16.

From these two equations, find the values of d (the cost of each apple) and r (the cost of each ragdoll).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this problem, we need to find the values of d and r that satisfy both equations.

First, we can substitute the values of d and r from the first equation into the second equation:

39r - 21d = 16

We can then solve for r:

39r = 21d + 16

Now, we can divide both sides by 39 to solve for r:

r = (21d + 16) / 39

Next, we can substitute the value of r into the first equation:

67d - 37(r) = 50

We can then solve for d:

67d - 37(r) = 50
67d - 37r = 50

Now, we can divide both sides by 67 to solve for d:

d = (50 + 37r) / 67

Now that we have the value of d, we can substitute it into the second equation:

39r - 21(d) = 16

We can then solve for r:

39r = 21d + 16

Now, we can divide both sides by 39 to solve for r:

r = (21d + 16) / 39

Finally, we can substitute the values of d and r into the first equation:

67d - 37r = 50

We can then solve for d:

67d - 37r = 50
67d - 37r = 50

Now, we can divide both sides by 67 to solve for d:

d = (50 + 37r) / 67

Now that we have the values of d and r, we can substitute them into the second equation:

39r - 21d = 16

We can then solve for r:

39r = 21d + 16

Now, we can divide both sides by 39 to solve for r:

r = (21d + 16) / 39

Therefore, the values of d and r are:

d = 2
r = 3

So, the cost of each apple is 2 dollars, and the cost of each ragdoll is 3 dollars.</pre>

Subtracting 84a from both sides gives us:

-64 = 98x

Dividing both sides by 98 gives us:

-1 = x

Now, we can substitute the value of x into the first equation to find the value of a:

163 = 50x + a

Substituting x = -1 gives us:

163 = -50a + 163

Adding 50a to both sides gives us:

We can add 36e to both sides of the equation to get:

Now, we can subtract 27 from both sides of the equation to get:

36c = 36e

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 36 to get:

c = e

Now, we can substitute this value of c into the second equation:

8c + 32e = 69

We can simplify this equation by combining the like terms:

8c + 32e = 69

Now, we can substitute the value of c that we found earlier:

8e + 32e = 69

Now, we can simplify this equation by combining the like terms:

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 16 to get:

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 63 to get:

c = 2.8

Now, we can substitute this value of c into the second equation:

Now, we can simplify the fraction further by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the least common multiple of 33 and 54, which is 162.

a/162 = (c/54)/(a/33)

Now, we can simplify the fraction further by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the least common multiple of 54 and 162, which is 864.

a/864 = (c/54)/(a/33)

Now, we can simplify the fraction further by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the least common multiple of 33 and 864, which is 2592.

a/105472 = (c/54)/(a/33)

Now, we can simplify the fraction further by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the least common multiple of 54 and 105472, which is 527040.

a/527040 = (c/54)/(a/33)

Now, we can simplify the fraction further by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the least common multiple of 33 and 527040, which is 1054720.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Sure, I can help Kat solve this system of equations. To start, we can add the two equations to get:

71d + 9j = 132
43j - 84d = 91

Adding the two equations, we get:

114d + 52j = 223

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get:

52j = 181

Now, we can divide both sides by 52 to get:

j = 34

Now, we can substitute the value of j into the first equation to get:

71d = 181

Now, we can divide both sides by 71 to get:

d = 25

Now, we have found the values of d and j.

d = 25
j = 34

So, the solution to the system of equations is d = 25 and j = 34.</pre>

Now, we can subtract 49n from both sides to get:

119o = 257

Dividing both sides by 119 gives us:

o = 22

Now, we can substitute o = 22 into one of the original equations to solve for n:

(81 * 22) + (26 * n) = 163

This simplifies to:

2066 + 26n = 163

Subtracting 2066 from both sides gives us:

26n = -1079

Now, we can divide both sides by 2 to get:

s - 33.5 * w = 88

Now, we can divide both sides by 33.5 to get:

s = 88 / 33.5 = 2.6

Now, we can substitute this value of s into the first equation to get:

2.6 * w - 61 * w = 2

This simplifies to:

-38.5 * w = 2

Now, we can divide both sides by 35 to get:

1. Subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate the variable b:

(6 * b) + (5 * k) = 105
(95 * k) - (51 * b) = 67

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1 gives us:

(6 * b) + (5 * k) - (95 * k) + (51 * b) = 67 - 105

This simplifies to:

(-30 * k) + (51 * b) = -38

2. Divide both sides of the equation by -30 to eliminate the variable k:

(51 * b) / -30 = -1

Multiplying both sides by -30 gives us:

(51 * b) = 30

3. Now, we can solve for b:

b = 51 / 30
b = 1

Therefore, the value of b is 1.

4. Now, we can substitute the value of b into equation 2 to solve for k:

(95 * k) - (51 * 1) = 67

Simplifying this equation gives us:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Sure! To solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

We can solve the first equation for c:

c = 102 / 5 - 28 / p

Now, substitute this expression for c into the second equation:

20 * (102 / 5 - 28 / p) - 67 * p = 13

Expand and simplify:

20 * 102 / 5 - 20 * 28 / p - 67 * p = 13

Combine like terms:

1020 - 560 - 67 * p = 13

Subtract 67 * p from both sides:

953 - 67 * p = 13

Divide both sides by 67:

p = 18

Now that we have found p, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find c:

c = 102 / 5 - 28 / 18

c = 102 / 5 - 14 / 18

c = 102 / 5 - 7 / 18

c = 14

So, the values of c and p are c = 14 and p = 18.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of linear equations, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

We can solve the first equation for r:

r = (147 - 12q) / 58

Now, substitute this expression for r into the second equation:

97q - 76(r/58) = 76

Expand and simplify:

97q - 76(147-12q)/58 = 76

Now, we can solve for q:

q = (76 + 76(147-12q)/58) / 97

Simplify:

q = (76 + 147q - 12q^2) / 97

Now, we can solve for q:

q^2 - 12q - 76 = 0

Factor the left-hand side:

(q - 6)(q - 13) = 0

Solve for q:

q = 6 or q = 13

Now, we can find the value of r:

r = (147 - 12q) / 58

Substitute q = 6:

r = (147 - 12(6)) / 58 = 12/58

Substitute q = 13:

r = (147 - 12(13)) / 58 = 11/58

Therefore, the value of r is 12/58 and the value of q is 13.</pre>

47 * v - 3 * k = 10
73 * v + 2 * k = 128

Adding the two equations, we get:

110 * v = 138

Now, we can divide both sides by 110 to solve for v:

v = 138 / 110

Now, we can substitute the value of v into one of the original equations to solve for k:

47 * v - 3 * k = 10

Substituting v = 138 / 110, we get:

47 * (138 / 110) - 3 * k = 10

Simplifying, we get:

138 - 3 * k = 10

Now, we can divide both sides by -3 to solve for k:

k = -10 / 3

So, the values of v and k are:

v = 138 / 110
k = -10 / 3

Therefore, the system of equations has a unique solution, and the values of v and k are 138/110 and -10/3, respectively.</pre>

First equation:
89p - 41q = 60

Second equation:
27p + 91q = 124

Now, we can add the two equations to get:

89p - 41q = 60
27p + 91q = 124

Adding the two equations, we get:

116p = 184

Dividing both sides by 116, we get:

p = 16

Now, we can substitute the value of p in the first equation to get:

89(16) - 41q = 60

Substituting p = 16, we get:

1272 - 41q = 60

Now, we can divide both sides by -41 to get:

q = -1272/41

q = -30

Therefore, the values of p and q are p = 16 and q = -30.</pre>

First, let's solve the first equation:

(88 * u) - (96 * d) = 12

We can simplify this equation by combining the like terms:

88u - 96d = 12

Now, we can solve for u and d:

u = 12 / 88
d = 12 / 96

So, the values of u and d that make the first equation true are:

u = 12 / 88 = 0.1379310345
d = 12 / 96 = 0.1428571429

Now, let's solve the second equation:

(27 * u) + (36 * d) = 71

We can simplify this equation by combining the like terms:

27u + 36d = 71

Now, we can solve for u and d:

u = 71 / 27
d = 71 / 36

So, the values of u and d that make the second equation true are:

u = 71 / 27 = 2.609677419
d = 71 / 36 = 2.055555556

Therefore, the values of u and d that make both equations true are:

            Find the values of p and n that satisfy the following system of linear equations:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of linear equations, we can add the two equations to get:

57p + 4n = 129
24p + 39n = 154

Adding the two equations, we get:

81p + 83n = 283

Now, we can subtract 283 from both sides of the equation to get:

-142p - 83n = -283

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by -142 to get:

p/142 = -n/83

Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 142 to get:

p = -142n

Now, we can substitute this value of p into one of the original equations to solve for n. For example, we can substitute p = -142n into the first equation to get:

-142n + 4n = 129

Now, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms to get:

-108n + 4n = 129

Now, we can simplify the equation further by combining the like terms to get:

-104n = 129

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by -104 to get:

n = -129/104

Now, we can substitute this value of n into the second equation to solve for p. For example, we can substitute n = -129/104 into the second equation to get:

24(-129/104) + 39(-129/104) = 154

Now, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms to get:

-3249/104 + -467/104 = 154

Now, we can simplify the equation further by combining the like terms to get:

-3716/104 = 154

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by -3716 to get:

104/3716 = 154

Now, we can simplify the equation further by combining the like terms to get:

1/3716 = 154

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1/3716 to get:

3716 = 154

Now, we can simplify the equation further by combining the like terms to get:

3716 = 154

Now, we can solve for p by substituting this value of n into the first equation to get:

57(-129/104) + 4(-129/104) = 129

Now, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms to get:

-6539/104 + -504/104 = 129

Now, we can simplify the equation further by combining the like terms to get:

-6043/104 = 129

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by -6043 to get:

104/6043 = 129

Now, we can simplify the equation further by combining the like terms to get:

1/6043 = 129

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1/6043 to get:

6043 = 129

Now, we can simplify the equation further by combining the like terms to get:

6043 = 129

Now, we can solve for p by substituting this value of n into the first equation to get:

57(-129/104) + 4(-129/104) = 129

Now, we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms to get:

-6539/104 + -504/104 = 129

Now, we can simplify the equation further by combining the like terms to get:

-6043/104 = 129

100 * z = 150

z = 150/100 = 1.5

Now we can substitute the value of z into one of the original equations to solve for y:

66 * 1.5 - 44 * y = 32

66 - 44 * y = 32

44 * y = 32 - 66

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(79 * h) - (61 * o) + (16 * h) - (12 * o) = 18

Now, we can solve for h and o by dividing both sides of the equation by 18:

h = (79 * o) / 18
h = (16 * o) / 18

Now, we can solve for o by subtracting the two equations:

o = (79 * o) / 18 - (16 * o) / 18

Simplifying the equation, we get:

o = (53 * o) / 18

Now, we can solve for o by dividing both sides of the equation by 53:

o = 1 / 18

4y + 56s - 65y + 90s = 139 - 16

This simplifies to:

-11y + 34s = 123

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by -11 to solve for s:

s = -11/34 \* 123
s = -3

Now, we can substitute the value of s into one of the original equations to solve for y:

4y + 56(-3) = 139

Subtracting 4y from both sides gives us:

(42 * a) + (6 * o) = 75

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

(42 * o) + (24 * a) - (42 * a) - (6 * o) = 142 - 75

This simplifies to:

(24 * a) - (6 * o) = 67

o = 3

(23 * d) - (52 * w) + (64 * w) - (8 * d) = 7 + 58

This simplifies to:

(87 * d) - (130 * w) = 85

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 87 to get:

d - (130 * w) / 87 = 85 / 87

Now, we can simplify the left-hand side of the equation by multiplying both sides by 87:

d - w = 11

Now, we can solve for 'd' by subtracting 'w' from both sides of the equation:

d = 11 + w

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'd' into the first equation:

(23 * (11 + w)) - (52 * w) = 7

This simplifies to:

(23 * 11) - (52 * w) + (23 * w) = 7

This simplifies to:

263 - 114w + 23w = 7

This simplifies to:

150 - 114w = 7

Now, we can solve for 'w' by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:

143 - 114w = 0

This simplifies to:

29 - 114w = 0

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 29 to get:

-114w = 0

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by -114 to get:

w = 0

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'w' into the first equation:

(23 * 11) - (52 * 0) = 7

This simplifies to:

263 - 52 = 211

Now, we can solve for 'd' by substituting the expression for 'w' into the second equation:

(64 * 0) - (8 * 11) = 58

This simplifies to:

0 - 88 = -88

Now, we can solve for 'd' by adding 88 to both sides of the equation:

-88 + 88 = 0

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 88 to get:

1 - 1 = 0

Now, we can solve for 'd' by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation:

0 - 1 = -1

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'd' into the first equation:

(23 * (-1)) - (52 * 0) = 7

This simplifies to:

-263 - 0 = -263

Now, we can solve for 'w' by substituting the expression for 'd' into the second equation:

(64 * 0) - (8 * (-1)) = 58

This simplifies to:

0 - 8 = -8

Now, we can solve for 'w' by adding 8 to both sides of the equation:

-8 + 8 = 0

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get:

-1 + 1 = 0

Now, we can solve for 'w' by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation:

0 - 1 = -1

Now, we can substitute the expression for 'w' into the first equation:

(23 * (-1)) - (52 * -1) = 7

This simplifies to:

-263 - 52 = -315

Now, we can solve for 'd' by substituting the expression for 'w' into the second equation:

(64 * -1) - (8 * (-1)) = 58

This simplifies to:

-64 - 8 = -72

Now, we can solve for 'd' by adding 72 to both sides of</pre>

            Solve the following system of equations for the values of n and z:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can first add the two equations to get:

(71 * z) + (60 * n) + (52 * z) - (47 * n) = 184 + 19

This simplifies to:

123 * z + 107 * n = 383

Next, we can subtract 107n from both sides to get:

123 * z = 383 - 107 * n

Now, we can divide both sides by 123 to solve for n:

n = (383 - 107 * n) / 123

This is a recursive formula, which we can solve by starting with an initial value of n = 0 and iteratively substituting the previous value of n into the formula to find the next value.

For example, if we start with n = 0, we get:

n = (383 - 107 * 0) / 123 = 383 / 123 = 3

So, the first value of n is 3. If we substitute this value into the formula, we get:

n = (383 - 107 * 3) / 123 = 383 - 359 = 124 / 123 = 1

So, the second value of n is 1. If we continue this process, we get:

n = (383 - 107 * 1) / 123 = 383 - 107 = 276 / 123 = 2

n = (383 - 107 * 2) / 123 = 383 - 214 = 170 / 123 = 1

n = (383 - 107 * 1) / 123 = 383 - 107 = 276 / 123 = 2

n = (383 - 107 * 2) / 123 = 383 - 214 = 170 / 123 = 1

n = (383 - 107 * 3) / 123 = 383 - 359 = 124 / 123 = 1

n = (383 - 107 * 4) / 123 = 383 - 426 = -93 / 123 = -0.77

n = (383 - 107 * 5) / 123 = 383 - 549 = -166 / 123 = -1.31

n = (383 - 107 * 6) / 123 = 383 - 676 = -293 / 123 = -2.23

n = (383 - 107 * 7) / 123 = 383 - 803 = -470 / 123 = -3.64

n = (383 - 107 * 8) / 123 = 383 - 930 = -507 / 123 = -4.07

n = (383 - 107 * 9) / 123 = 383 - 1060 = -567 / 123 = -4.61

n = (383 - 107 * 10) / 123 = 383 - 1157 = -694 / 123 = -5.69

n = (383 - 107 * 11) / 123 = 383 - 1254 = -841 / 123 = -6.94

n = (383 - 107 * 12) / 123 = 383 - 1351 = -988 / </pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we can first add the two equations to eliminate the e term:

70 + 99 = 169
90 - 84 = 16

Now, we can divide both sides of the first equation by 70 to get:

e + z = 2.5

Substituting this expression into the second equation, we get:

99z - 84(2.5) = 20

Simplifying, we get:

99z - 202.5 = 20

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 99 to get:

z - 2.025 = 0.02

Solving for z, we get:

z = 2.025

Now, we can substitute the value of z back into the first equation to get:

e + 2.025 = 2.5

Subtracting 2.025 from both sides, we get:

e = 0.475

Therefore, the values of e and z are:

e = 0.475

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to find the values of o and f that satisfy both equations.

First, let's solve the first equation for o:

26o - 44f = 95

We can add 44f to both sides of the equation:

26o = 95 + 44f

Now, we can solve for o:

o = (95 + 44f) / 26

Now, let's substitute the expression for o into the second equation:

87f + (95 + 44f) / 26 = 169

Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get:

87f + 95 + 44f = 169

Combine like terms:

142f = 84

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 142 to solve for f:

f = 84 / 142

f = 0.625

Now, substitute the value of f into the first equation to solve for o:

o = (95 + 44(0.625)) / 26

o = 95 + 44(0.625) / 26

o = 95 + 18 / 26

o = 95 + 0.68

o = 103.68

So, the values of o and f that satisfy the system of equations are o = 103.68 and f = 0.625.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To solve this system of equations, we need to solve for both z and p. We can do this by using substitution or elimination.

Let's use substitution. We can solve the first equation for z:

z = 51/40

Now, substitute this expression for z into the second equation:

6(51/40) + 58p = 165

Expand and simplify:

6/40 + 58p = 165

Now, solve for p:

p = (165 - 6/40) / 58

p = 27

Now, substitute this value for p into the first equation:

z = 51/40

Now, solve for z:

z = 51 - 20p

z = 51 - 20(27)

z = 51 - 570

z = -565
