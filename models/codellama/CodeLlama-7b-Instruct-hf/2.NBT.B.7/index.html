        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many milliliters of red paint are left in the paint container, we need to subtract the amount of paint used from the total amount of paint at the beginning.

We know that the paint container started with 792 milliliters of red paint.

We also know that after painting a few items, the paint container had 676 milliliters less in the container than at the beginning.

So, we can set up the equation:

792 - 676 = x

Where x is the amount of red paint left in the paint container.

To solve for x, we can add 676 to both sides of the equation:

792 - 676 = x
916 = x

So, there are 916 milliliters of red paint left in the paint container.</pre>

The number of Golden monkeys in the first area is 108.

So, the total number of Golden monkeys in both areas is:
108 + 848 = 956

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the notation &quot;p&quot; to represent the number of pizzas sold and &quot;b&quot; to represent the number of burgers sold.

We know that the pizza stall sold 442 pizzas in a day, so we can write an equation:

p + b = 442

We also know that the burger stall sold 516 burgers in the same day, so we can write another equation:

p + b = 516

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together:

2p + 2b = 968

Now we can solve for p and b:

p = 442 - b

Substituting this expression for p into the first equation, we get:

442 - b + b = 442

Simplifying, we get:

2b = 0

b = 0

So the number of burgers sold is 0.

The number of pizzas sold is 442.

Since the number of pine trees is the same as the number of maple trees, we can write:

35 + x = x + 35

Simplifying the equation:

35 + x = 2x

Solving for x:

x = 17

So, there are 17 pine trees in the park.

The total number of trees in the park is 35 + 17 = 52 trees.</pre>

We know that 622 non-functional telescopes were repaired and brought back to functionality, so we can add that to the total number of telescopes to find the current number of functional telescopes.

We know that the farmer had 874 grapes to start with, and he sold 748 of them. So, he had 874 - 748 = &lt;&lt;874-748=126&gt;&gt;126 grapes left.

We also know that the farmer sold some of the grapes at the market, so we can set up an equation to represent this:

x + 126 = 748

Now, we can solve for &quot;x&quot; by subtracting 126 from both sides of the equation:

x = 748 - 126

x = &lt;&lt;748-126=622&gt;&gt;622

176 trees were uprooted and destroyed, so the total number of trees that were lost is 176.

The original number of trees in the forest was 536, so the total number of trees before the storm was 536 - 176 = 360 trees.

If the storm still uprooted and destroyed 176 trees, then the total number of trees that were lost is 176.

The original number of trees in the forest was 183, so the total number of trees before the storm was 183 - 176 = 7 trees.

Therefore, there are 7 trees remaining in the forest after the storm.

In October, the skateboard store sold 603 skateboards.
In November, the skateboard store sold 298 fewer skateboards than in October.

So, the number of skateboards sold in November is:
603 - 298 = 305

            Jack is a professional mountain climber. He has a rope that is 623 meters long. He buys an additional rope to make sure he is prepared for any situation. The total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. What is the total length of the two ropes?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the length of the first rope x.

We know that the total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope, so the total length of both ropes is x + 377.

We also know that the total length of both ropes is 623 meters long, so we can set up the equation:

x + 377 = 623

To solve for x, we can subtract 377 from both sides of the equation:

x = 623 - 377
x = 246

So the length of the first rope is 246 meters.

Now we can find the length of the second rope by adding 377 to 246:

246 + 377 = 623

So the length of the second rope is also 246 meters.

Therefore, the total length of both ropes is 246 + 246 = 492 meters.</pre>
