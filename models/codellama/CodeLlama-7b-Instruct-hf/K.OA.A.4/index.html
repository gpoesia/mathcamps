We know that the kite spent 6 minutes at its highest point, so it spent 10-6 = &lt;&lt;10-6=4&gt;&gt;4 minutes before it reached its highest point.

We also know that the kite flies for exactly 10 minutes, so it flies for 10-x = &lt;&lt;10-x=10-4=6&gt;&gt;6 minutes after it reached its highest point.

Therefore, the kite flies for 6 minutes before it reached its highest point and 6 minutes after it reached its highest point, for a total of 12 minutes.
