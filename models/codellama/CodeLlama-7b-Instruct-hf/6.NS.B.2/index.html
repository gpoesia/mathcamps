            There are 73841 cubic centimeters of air needed to inflate a large beach ball. If we fill the ball up at a rate of 41 cubic centimeters per second, how many seconds will it take to fully inflate the beach ball?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the time it will take to fully inflate the beach ball, we need to divide the total volume of air needed by the rate at which the ball is being filled.

First, let's convert the volume of air needed from cubic centimeters to liters:

73841 cubic centimeters = 73841/1000 liters

Next, we can use the formula:

Time = Total volume / Filling rate

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

Time = 73841/1000 liters / 41 cubic centimeters/second

Time = 178.8 seconds

Therefore, it will take approximately 178.8 seconds to fully inflate the large beach ball.</pre>

Speed = Distance / Time

We know that the distance the penguin covers is 41020 feet, and the time it takes is 5 hours. We can convert the time from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:

Time in minutes = 5 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 300 minutes

Now we can plug in the values we know into the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time
= 41020 feet / 300 minutes
= 136.6667 feet/minute

Therefore, the penguin's speed is 136.6667 feet per minute.</pre>

In this case, the distance is 14824 meters, the rate is the mouse's constant rate, and the time is 4 hours.

So, we can plug these values into the formula to solve for the rate:

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for the rate:

rate = 14824 / 4

rate = 3666 meters per hour
