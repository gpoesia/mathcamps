Zazu found 66 shiny stones.
Umi found 70 more shiny stones than Zazu.
Yara found 36 shiny stones in addition to what Umi found.

We can start by using the information that Umi found 70 more shiny stones than Zazu. This means that Umi found a total of 66 + 70 = 136 shiny stones.

Next, we can use the information that Yara found 36 shiny stones in addition to what Umi found. This means that Yara found a total of 136 + 36 = 172 shiny stones.

Therefore, the total number of shiny stones that Yara found is 172.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  The total distance from which both Mike's binoculars and telescope can magnify objects is the sum of the distances from which each can magnify objects.

Mike's binoculars can magnify objects from a distance of 30 miles away, and the right lens can magnify objects that are 56 miles away. Therefore, the total distance from which his binoculars can magnify objects is 30 + 56 = 86 miles.

Mike's telescope can magnify objects from a distance of 67 miles away. Therefore, the total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects is 86 + 67 = 153 miles.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous problem, we considered the distance that Mike's binocular's two lenses can magnify. Consider now that we made a mistake and that the left lens can actually magnify objects from a distance of 54 miles away instead of 30 miles. Keeping the right lense and the telescope the same at 56 and 67 miles respectively, what would be the new total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  The total distance from which both Mike's binoculars and telescope can magnify objects is the sum of the distances from which each can magnify objects.

Mike's binoculars can magnify objects from a distance of 54 miles away, and the right lens can magnify objects that are 56 miles away. Therefore, the total distance from which his binoculars can magnify objects is 54 + 56 = 110 miles.

Mike's telescope can magnify objects from a distance of 67 miles away. Therefore, the total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects is 110 + 67 = 177 miles.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the land of the Wizarding World, one wand spells costs 50 magical crystals known as Quiblets. Quintus the wizard adds 5 Quiblets more to this to cast a slightly stronger spell. This amount is then topped up by 25 magical Quiblets to cast the most powerful spell. How many Quiblets does Quintus the wizard need to cast the most powerful spell?

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To cast the most powerful spell, Quintus the wizard needs to add 5 Quiblets to the 50 Quiblets he already has. This brings the total number of Quiblets to 50 + 5 = 55. Then, he adds 25 more Quiblets to cast the most powerful spell, bringing the total number of Quiblets to 55 + 25 = 80.

Therefore, Quintus the wizard needs 80 Quiblets to cast the most powerful spell.</pre>
