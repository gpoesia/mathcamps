            A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total number of packs of socks the company will have once all the socks have been packaged, we need to add the number of packs already made (93) to the number of socks left to package (2840/40 = 72.5).

72.5 + 93 = 165.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 166.

Now, we need to subtract the number of packs returned due to quality issues (8) from the total number of packs.

166 - 8 = 158

Therefore, the company will have 158 packs of socks in total.</pre>

            Following from the previous scenario, consider instead that the furniture store originally had 79 chairs, but this time, they only received a shipment adding 4 more chairs before selling 45 chairs in a single day. How many chairs are now in the store under this altered situation?

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

1. The furniture store had 79 chairs in stock initially.
2. The shipment added 4 chairs, so the total number of chairs now in the store is 79 + 4 = 83 chairs.
3. The store sold 45 chairs in a single day, so the number of chairs left in the store is 83 - 45 = 38 chairs.

Therefore, there are 38 chairs left in the store under this altered situation.

* The leprechaun adds 39 gold coins to the pot.
* The leprechaun then adds 47 more gold coins to the pot.
* The fairy takes away 8 gold coins from the pot.
* The new total of coins becomes a code to a magical lock.
* The code must be enhanced by adding 48 to it only once, and then multiplied by 24.

Now, let's use the information given in the problem to find the final value to unlock the magical lock:

* The leprechaun adds 39 + 47 = 86 gold coins to the pot.
* The fairy takes away 8 gold coins from the pot, leaving 78 gold coins.
* The new total of coins is 78 + 48 = 126 gold coins.
* The code to unlock the magical lock is 126 multiplied by 24, which gives us a final value of 3248.

If the farmer collects the same amount of carrots every day, then the total number of carrots collected in one day is equal to the number of carrots collected in the first day.

Let's call the number of carrots collected in the first day &quot;x&quot;. Then, the total number of carrots collected in one day is equal to x.

Now, let's find the total number of carrots collected in 77 days.

The farmer collects the same amount of carrots every day, so the total number of carrots collected in 77 days is equal to the number of carrots collected in one day multiplied by 77.

x (days) = x (days) x 77

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 77x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12,960

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the impact on the total distance traveled by the train, we need to first calculate the distance traveled at the slower speed of 28 mph.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 28 mph x 21 hours
Distance = 660 miles

Next, we need to calculate the distance traveled at the faster speed of 68 mph.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 68 mph x 21 hours
Distance = 1,440 miles

Now, we need to subtract the distance traveled at the slower speed from the total distance traveled at the faster speed to find the impact on the total distance traveled by the train.

Impact = Total Distance - Distance at Slower Speed
Impact = 1,440 miles - 660 miles
Impact = 780 miles

Therefore, the impact on the total distance traveled by the train is 780 miles.</pre>

Just like the previous day, by midday, he managed to harvest some more, bringing the total to 95 + 82 tomatoes in the basket. Unfortunately, he found that 37 of these tomatoes were not ripe enough to sell. How many ripe tomatoes did the farmer have left in his basket after this day?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The farmer started his day with 95 tomatoes in his basket.
By midday, he managed to harvest some more, bringing the total to 95 + 82 = 177 tomatoes in the basket.
Unfortunately, he found that 37 of these tomatoes were not ripe enough to sell.
Therefore, the farmer has 177 - 37 = 140 tomatoes left in the basket that are ripe and ready to sell.

            On a particular beach, there is a tendency for 74 seashells to appear every day. After 42 days of collection, a beachcomber also discovered an additional 56 seashells that had been hidden in the sand. How many seashells did the beachcomber have in total after 42 days?

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the word &quot;shell&quot; to represent the number of seashells that the beachcomber had in total after 42 days.

We know that the beachcomber had 74 seashells every day, so the number of seashells they had after 42 days is equal to 74 x 42 = 3,084 seashells.

We also know that the beachcomber discovered 56 additional seashells that had been hidden in the sand, so the total number of seashells the beachcomber had after 42 days is equal to 3,084 + 56 = 3,140 seashells.

Therefore, the beachcomber had 3,140 seashells in total after 42 days.</pre>
