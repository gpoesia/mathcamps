            There are 535 fish in a large tank and a shark eats 461 of them in one sitting. If the shark continues this pattern and only eats when there are 461 or more fish to consume, how many fish will be leftover after its dinner?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the number of fish left over after the shark's dinner &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the shark eats 461 fish in one sitting, so it will eat x fish in the next sitting if there are 461 or more fish to consume.

We also know that there are 535 fish in the tank, so there will be 535 - 461 = 74 fish left over after the shark's first dinner.

Now, let's consider the pattern of the shark's eating. If the shark continues eating in this pattern, it will eat 74 fish in the next sitting, and then 74 - 461 = -387 fish in the next sitting, and so on.

Since the shark only eats when there are 461 or more fish to consume, it will stop eating when there are only 461 fish left. So, the number of fish left over after the shark's dinner will be 461 - 74 = 387 fish.

Therefore, there will be 387 fish left over after the shark's dinner.</pre>

The number of viewing evenings that can be distributed among all members is 759 / 228 = 3.32 viewing evenings.

Since we need to distribute the viewing evenings evenly amongst all members, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 viewing evenings.

We know that the total number of flies in the pond is 941, so we can set up the equation:

x \* 258 + 258 = 941

Simplifying the equation:

x \* 258 = 683

Dividing both sides by 258:

x = 26

So, the frog jumps 26 times, and each jump eats 258 flies, leaving 683 - 26 \* 258 = 683 - 683 = 0 flies in the pond.</pre>

193 liters / 167 bottles = 3.02 liters per bottle

Now, we need to find out how many liters overflow. We can do this by subtracting the total amount of water that can be distributed to the bottles from the total amount of water that needs to be distributed.

Since we want to round up to the nearest whole number, we'll round up to 2 boxes.

804 snowballs / 184 snowballs per snowman = 4.31 snowmen

Since we can't have a fraction of a snowman, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5 snowmen.

So, 804 snowballs / 184 snowballs per snowman = 5 snowmen

Now, we need to find out how many snowballs are left leftover after building 5 snowmen. We can do this by subtracting the total number of snowballs needed for all the snowmen from the total number of snowballs made:

804 snowballs - (5 snowmen x 184 snowballs per snowman) = 804 - 966 = -162 snowballs

To distribute the roses evenly, we need to divide the total number of roses by the number of tributes.

984 roses / 426 roses per tribute = 2.31 tributes

Since all the blocks of cheese are evenly distributed in the boxes, we can assume that each box is completely filled. Therefore, we can calculate the number of blocks of cheese that would be left over after all the boxes are filled:

686 blocks of cheese - (2 boxes x 349 blocks per box) = 686 - 756 = -170 blocks

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how much power is left over, we need to subtract the amount of power consumed by the village from the total amount of power generated by the windmill.

First, let's calculate the amount of power consumed by the village in full increments:

385 units/day x 30 days/month = 11,700 units/month

Next, let's calculate the total amount of power generated by the windmill:

506 units/day x 30 days/month = 15,360 units/month

Now, let's subtract the amount of power consumed by the village from the total amount of power generated by the windmill:

15,360 - 11,700 = 3,660 units/month

Therefore, there are 3,660 units of power left over at the end of the day.</pre>

Now, we need to subtract the number of scooters that have been loaded on the trucks from the total number of scooters produced to find out how many scooters will be left.

Since all droplets are used to form raindrops, the number of droplets left unconverted in the cloud after reaching the maximum number of rain drops is 846 - 1.17\*722 = &lt;&lt;846-1.17\*722=117&gt;&gt;117 droplets.

* The total number of unicorns is 265.

We can use the division algorithm to find the number of unicorns in each section:

Since we can't have a fraction of a unicorn, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each section will have 2 unicorns.

Now, we need to find the number of unicorns in the last incomplete section. We can do this by subtracting the number of complete sections from the total number of unicorns:

We know that 383 players can enter a match at a time, so we can write an equation based on this information:

x + (923 - x) = 383

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 540 = 383

Subtracting 540 from both sides:

2x = 303

Dividing both sides by 2:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  If every 44 steps you make leads you to a significant place or clue, then the number of steps left after reaching the last significant place or clue will be 236 modulo 44, which is equal to 10.

To see why, let's break down the problem:

* Every 44 steps leads you to a significant place or clue.
* There are 236 steps in total.
* If you start at step 0, the last significant place or clue will be reached after 236/44 = 5.2 steps.
* However, since you can't reach a fractional step, the last significant place or clue will be reached after the next whole number of steps, which is 6 steps.
* Therefore, the number of steps left after reaching the last significant place or clue will be 236 - 6 = 230 steps.

So, the answer is 230 steps.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's first calculate the total number of swings that can be used:

931 kids / 34 kids per swing set = 27.5 swing sets

Since all the swing sets are filled continuously, we can assume that the kids will be waiting for their turn after all the swing sets are occupied.

Let's calculate the total number of kids waiting for their turn:

931 kids - 27.5 swing sets x 34 kids per swing set = 931 - 89.5 = 841.5 kids

Since we can't have a fraction of a kid waiting for their turn, we round up to the nearest whole number:

842 kids will be waiting for their turn after all the swing sets are occupied.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's say John has x dollar bills left.

We know that John has 943 dollar bills in total.

We also know that each wallet can hold 433 dollar bills.

So, if John tries to stuff as many wallets as he can, he will have:

x + (433 x number of wallets) = 943

We want to find the value of x.

We can set up the equation:

x + (433 x number of wallets) = 943

We know that the number of wallets is equal to the number of dollar bills left over.

So, we can write:

x + (433 x x) = 943

Simplifying the equation:

x + 433x = 943

Combine like terms:

566x = 943

Divide both sides by 566:

x = 943/566

x = 1.69

So, John has 1.69 dollar bills left over after fully loading as many wallets as he can.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's say there are x sleeping bags left.

We know that the company donated 639 sleeping bags, and each campsite was supplied with 374 sleeping bags. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

639 = (374 x n) + x

where n is the number of campsites.

We want to find x, so we can solve for it. We can do this by subtracting 374x from both sides of the equation:

639 - 374x = x

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 374:

x = (639 - 374x) / 374

Now, we can solve for x by setting the equation equal to 0 and solving for x:

x = 0

So, there are no sleeping bags left. All of the sleeping bags were distributed equally among the campsites.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To divide the gold coins evenly among the pirates, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 267 and 995.

The prime factors of 267 are 23, 3, and 13.
The prime factors of 995 are 5, 11, 13, and 23.

The LCM of 267 and 995 is 267 x 995 = 267,005.

Since 267,005 is not divisible by 10, there will be 5 gold coins left over after dividing the gold coins among the pirates.

We know that John has collected 365 coins and he wants to put equal numbers of them in his 140 wallets. So, each wallet will have 365/140 = 2.63 coins.

Since John wants to have an even distribution, he will round up the number of coins in each wallet to the nearest whole number. So, each wallet will have 3 coins.

Therefore, John will have 3 x 140 = 420 coins in his wallets.

We also know that John will have some coins left after evenly distributing them into these wallets. So, we can subtract the number of coins in each wallet from the total number of coins collected:

365 - 420 = 135

Therefore, John will have 135 coins left.

Since 771 children can go down the slide without rest, we can write the equation:

923 - 771 = 0

We know that the shop uses 18 slices of bread for each batch, and it has 580 slices of bread in total. So, we can set up the following equation:

580 = 18x

To solve for x (the number of batches), we can divide both sides of the equation by 18:

580/18 = x

x = 33

So, the sandwich shop will make 33 batches of sandwiches.

Now, we can find out how many slices of bread the shop will have left after using up the bread in the batches. We know that each batch uses 18 slices of bread, so we can multiply the number of batches by 18 to find out how many slices of bread the shop will use up:

33 x 18 = 594

So, the sandwich shop will use up 594 slices of bread.

To find out how many slices of bread the shop will have left, we can subtract the number of slices of bread the shop will use up from the total number of slices of bread the shop had:

580 - 594 = 96

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            A tailor has 925 meters of fabric. The tailor uses 529 meters of fabric to make each dress. If the tailor uses the fabric evenly for each dress, how many meters of fabric will be left over after completing the dresses?

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

The tailor uses 529 meters of fabric to make each dress, so the total amount of fabric used for all the dresses is 529 x n = 529n, where n is the number of dresses made.

Since the tailor has 925 meters of fabric, we can set up the equation:

529n = 925

To solve for n, we can divide both sides by 529:

n = 925/529

n = 1.78

So, the tailor will make 1.78 dresses before running out of fabric.

The amount of fabric left over will be:

925 - 529n
= 925 - 529(1.78)
= 925 - 961.26
= 68.74

Therefore, the tailor will have 68.74 meters of fabric left over after completing the dresses.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's say the last group of the day has 530 people.

976 - 530 = 446

So, there will be 446 tourists left for the last group of the day.</pre>
