        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the number of kilograms of cucumbers sold &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the total weight of cucumbers in the storage room was 81.4 kilograms.

We also know that the weight of cucumbers sold was 66.05 kilograms.

So, we can set up the equation:

81.4 - x = 66.05

To solve for &quot;x&quot;, we need to isolate the variable &quot;x&quot;. We can do this by adding 81.4 to both sides of the equation:

81.4 + x = 66.05 + 81.4

This simplifies to:

99.4 + x = 147.45

Subtracting 99.4 from both sides gives us:

x = 48.05

So, 48.05 kilograms of cucumbers were sold.</pre>

We know that the total weight of the collection before selling any stuffed animals was 93.55 pounds.

We also know that the weight of the remaining stuffed animals after selling some is 70.4 pounds.

So, we can set up the equation:

93.55 - x = 70.4

To solve for x, we can subtract 70.4 from both sides of the equation:

93.55 - x = 70.4 - 70.4

This simplifies to:

-x = -14.05

Dividing both sides of the equation by -1 gives us:

x = 14.05

So, the collector sold 14.05 pounds of stuffed animals.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total weight of the fisherman's catch, we need to multiply the number of fish caught by the average weight of a single fish.

Let's call the average weight of a single fish &quot;x&quot; kilograms.

We know that 30.4 fish were caught, so we can write the equation:

30.4x = 867 (since the average weight of a single fish is 86.7 kilograms)

Now, we can solve for &quot;x&quot; by dividing both sides of the equation by 30.4:

x = 867 / 30.4

x = 28.5

So, the total weight of the fisherman's catch is 30.4 times the average weight of a single fish, which is 28.5 kilograms.

Therefore, the total weight of the fisherman's catch is:

30.4 x 28.5 = 912.6 kilograms

We know that the total number of books at the beginning was 74.46, and the number of books left after selling some of them is 52.19. So, we can set up the equation:

74.46 - x = 52.19

To solve for &quot;x&quot;, we need to isolate the variable &quot;x&quot; on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 74.46 to both sides of the equation:

74.46 + x = 52.19 + 74.46

This simplifies to:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the average distance in light years of the star from each sighting point, we need to divide the distance in light years between the star and each sighting point by the number of sighting points.

Let's call the distance in light years between the star and each sighting point &quot;x&quot;. We know that the average distance in light years of the star from each sighting point is (3480.66 + x)/36.6.

We can simplify this expression by first dividing both the numerator and denominator by 36.6:

(3480.66 + x)/36.6 = (3480.66 + x)/36.6 \* (36.6/36.6)

= (3480.66 + x)/36.6 \* 1

= 3480.66/36.6 + x/36.6

= 95.33 + x/36.6

So the average distance in light years of the star from each sighting point is 95.33 + x/36.6.

To find the average distance in light years of the star from each sighting point, we need to find the value of x that makes the expression 95.33 + x/36.6 equal to the average distance in light years of the star from each sighting point.

We can do this by setting the expression equal to the average distance in light years of the star from each sighting point and solving for x:

95.33 + x/36.6 = 3480.66/36.6

x/36.6 = 3480.66/36.6 - 95.33

x = 3480.66/36.6 - 95.33 \* 36.6

x = 119.99

So the average distance in light years of the star from each sighting point is 95.33 + 119.99/36.6 = 100.33 light years.</pre>
