We know that the snowman is 4 times as tall as his hat, so the snowman's height is 4h.

We also know that the top hat is 5 inches tall, so h = 5/4.

Substituting h = 5/4 into the equation 4h = 72, we get:

4(5/4) = 72

Simplifying, we get:

20 = 72

This is a contradiction, so our original assumption that the snowman's hat is 5 inches tall must be false. Therefore, the snowman's hat is not 5 inches tall.</pre>

72 รท 8 = 9

So, each friend will get 9 cookies initially.

Now, we need to find out how many cookies each friend will get after the gifting. We can do this by multiplying the number of cookies each friend will get initially by 5:

9 x 5 = 45

So, each friend will get 45 cookies after the gifting.

Therefore, the total number of cookies each friend will get in total is 9 + 45 = 54 cookies.</pre>

        John wants to divide his camping area of 44 square meters into 11 equal sections. Each of these sections would host a tent. If each tent can accommodate 12 campers, how many campers can camp in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many campers can camp in total, we need to calculate the total area of the tent area.

Let's first calculate the area of each tent:

11 tents x 12 campers per tent = 132 square meters

Now, let's divide the total camping area by the area of each tent to find out how many tents can fit in the camping area:

44 square meters / 132 square meters per tent = 0.34

Since we can't have a fraction of a tent, we round up to the nearest whole number:

0.34 = 1

So, we can fit 1 tent in the camping area.

Now, let's calculate how many campers can fit in each tent:

12 campers per tent x 1 tent = 12 campers

Therefore, in total, we can fit 12 \* 1 = 12 campers in the camping area.</pre>

        A tiger can travel 6 miles in an hour. How far can it travel in 3 hours?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the distance traveled by the tiger in 3 hours, we can multiply the speed of the tiger by the time it takes to travel that distance.

Speed = Distance / Time

In this case, the speed of the tiger is 6 miles per hour, and the time it takes to travel 3 hours is 3 hours.

Distance = Speed x Time

Distance = 6 miles/hour x 3 hours

Distance = 18 miles

Therefore, the tiger can travel 18 miles in 3 hours.</pre>
