        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the original length of Eva's garden &quot;L&quot;. After extending it by 22.6 meters, the new length is &quot;L + 22.6&quot;.

The total area of Eva's garden is given by the product of the length and width:

Area = L \* 3

After the extension, the total area is:

Area = (L + 22.6) \* 3

We can simplify this by multiplying both sides by 3:

3Area = (L + 22.6) \* 3

Now, we can solve for Area:

Area = (L + 22.6) \* 3
Area = L \* 3 + 22.6 \* 3
Area = 3L + 69.4

So, the total area of Eva's garden after the extension is 3L + 69.4 square meters.</pre>

Distance to grocery store = 6.1 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled for each trip:

Total distance = Distance to grocery store + Distance back home

Since Bob travels 3 times a week, the total distance traveled for each trip is:

Total distance = Distance to grocery store + Distance back home

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled for all 3 trips:

Total distance = (Distance to grocery store + Distance back home) x Number of trips

Total distance = (6.1 miles + 6.1 miles) x 3

Total distance = 12.2 miles x 3

Total distance = 36.6 miles

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the number of miles traveled per gallon of gas, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the amount of gas consumed.

First, let's convert the distance traveled from miles to gallons:

367.8 miles / 15 gallons per tank = 25.9 gallons

Now, let's divide the total distance traveled by the amount of gas consumed:

367.8 miles / 25.9 gallons = 14.0 miles per gallon

David has 984.4 dollars and wants to save an equal amount every week for the next 23 weeks.

So, we can set up the equation:

984.4 / 23 = x

Where x is the amount David should save each week.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 23:

x = 984.4 / 23

x = 42.75

            <span class="response-field">CodeLlama 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To distribute the paint evenly into 8 barrels, we can use the following formula:

Number of liters in each barrel = Total number of liters / Number of barrels

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

Number of liters in each barrel = 176 / 8

Number of liters in each barrel = 21

Therefore, there will be 21 liters of paint in each barrel.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the total cost of the shirts, we need to subtract the discount from the total cost of the shirts.

Total cost of shirts = Number of shirts x Cost per shirt
Total cost of shirts = 29 x $17
Total cost of shirts = $495

But Mark got a $1 discount on the total cost, so he actually paid:

Total cost paid = Total cost of shirts - Discount
Total cost paid = $495 - $1
Total cost paid = $494

Therefore, Mark paid $494 for the 29 shirts.</pre>

In this case, the car consumes 615 liters of gas every 41 hours, so we can calculate the number of liters consumed in 30 hours as follows:

615 liters / 41 hours = 15.2 liters per hour

Therefore, the car will consume 15.2 liters of gas per hour for 30 hours, or a total of 456 liters of gas.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's use the information given in the problem to create an equation.

We know that Emma had $38 in her wallet and she spent $32.60 on a book. This means that she had $38 - $32.60 = $5.40 left after buying the book.

We can write this information in an equation:

$38 - $32.60 = $5.40

Now, let's solve for the book cost. We know that the book cost is $32.60, so we can write an equation:

$32.60 = x

Substituting the equation we got from the first equation, we get:

$32.60 = $38 - $5.40

Simplifying, we get:

$32.60 = $33.40

So, the book cost $32.60.</pre>

            You bought a car for $303.5756 and you decided to pay it off in 19.51 monthly installments. After calculating, you find the amount for each monthly installment. If you add $41.35 to your monthly installments for car insurance, what is your total monthly payment for your car and insurance?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To calculate the monthly payment for the car and insurance, we need to first calculate the monthly payment for the car only.

The formula for calculating the monthly payment for a loan is:

Monthly Payment = (Loan Amount x Interest Rate x (1 - (1 + Interest Rate)^(-Number of Payments))) / (12 x (1 + Interest Rate)^(-Number of Payments))

In this case, the loan amount is $303.5756, the interest rate is 19.51%, and the number of payments is 120 (since the loan is for 19.51 months).

Plugging in these values, we get:

Monthly Payment = ($303.5756 x 19.51% x (1 - (1 + 19.51)^(-120))) / (12 x (1 + 19.51)^(-120))

Monthly Payment = $235.12

Now, to calculate the total monthly payment for the car and insurance, we need to add $41.35 to the monthly payment for the car.

Total Monthly Payment = Monthly Payment + Insurance Premium
Total Monthly Payment = $235.12 + $41.35
Total Monthly Payment = $276.47

Therefore, the total monthly payment for the car and insurance is $276.47.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the car's average mileage per gallon of gas used, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the total amount of gas used.

First, let's convert the distance traveled from miles to kilometers:

436.23179999999996 miles = 700.0000000000001 kilometers

Next, let's convert the amount of gas used from gallons to liters:

46.26 gallons = 17.87 liters

Now, we can divide the total distance traveled by the total amount of gas used to find the car's average mileage per gallon of gas used:

700.0000000000001 kilometers / 17.87 liters = 38.92 kilometers per liter

Finally, we can convert the average mileage per gallon of gas used from kilometers per liter to miles per gallon:

38.92 kilometers per liter x 1.609344 kilometers per mile = 64.8 miles per gallon

Therefore, the car's average mileage per gallon of gas used was 64.8 miles per gallon.</pre>
