First, let's convert the weight of the toothpaste in grams to kilograms:

77 grams = 0.077 kg

Next, let's convert the weight of toothpaste consumed in each usage from grams to kilograms:

11 grams = 0.011 kg

Now, we can divide the total weight of the toothpaste in the tube by the weight of toothpaste consumed in each usage to find out how many usages you can get from the tube:

We know that the watch manufacturer can produce 8 watches every hour, so they can produce a total of 8x watches in one hour.

x = 6

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's say each kitten has x toy mice.

We know that there are 3 kittens, so the total number of toy mice is 3x.

We also know that there are only 3 toy mice available, so x cannot be greater than 3.

Let's try x = 1, 2, or 3.

If x = 1, then the total number of toy mice is 3, which is not possible.

If x = 2, then the total number of toy mice is 6, which is not possible.

If x = 3, then the total number of toy mice is 9, which is not possible.

Therefore, the number of toy mice each kitten has is 3.

### Answer: Each kitten has 3 toy mice.</pre>

            Marie grew a truly bountiful crop of tomatoes this year, yielding 108 tomatoes. If she managed to pack the same number of tomatoes into each box and ended up with 12 boxes, how many tomatoes did each box contain?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning:

Let's call the number of tomatoes in each box x.

We know that Marie packed the same number of tomatoes into each box, so the total number of tomatoes in all the boxes is equal to the number of boxes multiplied by the number of tomatoes in each box.

12 boxes x x = 108 tomatoes

We also know that the total number of tomatoes is equal to the number of tomatoes in each box multiplied by the number of boxes.

x x 12 = 108 tomatoes

Now we can solve for x:

x = 108 / 12 = 8.75 tomatoes

So each box contained approximately 8.75 tomatoes.</pre>

            On a sunny beach day, a group of children starts a fun game. Each child gets to throw a beach ball 7 times in a row. If there have been 21 beach ball throws in total, how many children are there?

Each child throws the beach ball 7 times, so the total number of beach ball throws is 7x.

Since there have been 21 beach ball throws in total, we can set up the equation:

7x = 21

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 7:

x = 21/7

x = 3

So, there are 3 children in the group.</pre>

Each door panel weighs 5kg, so the total weight of all door panels is 5kg x number of door panels = 45kg.

Therefore, the number of door panels is 45/5 = &lt;&lt;45/5=9&gt;&gt;9.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Let's call the number of days it took to sell 84 compasses &quot;x&quot;.

We know that the compass maker sells 12 compasses each day, so the total number of compasses sold in one day is 12x.

We also know that the total number of compasses sold is 84, so we can set up the equation:

12x = 84

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 12:

x = 84/12

x = 7

So it took the compass maker 7 days to sell 84 compasses.</pre>

Now, let's convert the weight of one serving from ounces to pounds:

If the farmer has 40 strawberries and each friend gets 4 strawberries, then the total number of strawberries the farmer has is 40 + (4 x number of friends) = 40 + (4 x x) = 40 + 4x.

We are given that the total number of strawberries the farmer has is 72, so we can set up the equation:

40 + 4x = 72

To solve for x, we can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

4x = 72 - 40
4x = 32

Dividing both sides of the equation by 4 gives us the number of friends the farmer has:

x = 32/4
x = 8

            An astronaut has 88 hours of oxygen in his tank. If he can use this tank for 8 days, how many hours of oxygen does the tank provide each day?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find out how many hours of oxygen the tank provides each day, we need to divide the total number of hours by the number of days.

88 hours / 8 days = 11 hours per day

So, the tank provides 11 hours of oxygen each day.</pre>
