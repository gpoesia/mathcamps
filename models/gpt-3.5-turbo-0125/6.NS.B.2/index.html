            There is a cloud which covers 8744 square meters of the sky and exactly the same area is revealed when the cloud dispels. If the revealed area is divided equally over the original area, what is the ratio of the revealed area to the original area?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let the original area be \( x \) square meters. When the cloud covers the sky, the area covered is \( x \) square meters. When the cloud dispels, the revealed area is also \( x \) square meters.

Given that the revealed area is divided equally over the original area, we have:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 8744
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = 2 \times 8744 = 17488

The ratio of the revealed area to the original area is:

\[
\frac{8744}{17488} = \frac{1}{2}

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many pens would have been produced each hour if the factory had produced 2526 pens in 547 hours, we divide the total number of pens produced by the total number of hours worked.

2526 pens / 547 hours = 4.62 pens per hour.

Since we cannot produce a fraction of a pen, we would round down to the nearest whole number.
