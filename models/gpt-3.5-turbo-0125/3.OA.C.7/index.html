            Superhero Green Gauntlet has the ability to multiply his strength by a factor of 3. If Jetstream, another superhero, has 5 times the strength of Green Gauntlet, what is the strength of Jetstream?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's denote Green Gauntlet's strength as \(x\). Jetstream's strength is 5 times the strength of Green Gauntlet, so Jetstream's strength is \(5x\). Since Green Gauntlet can multiply his strength by a factor of 3, his actual strength is \(3x\). Therefore, we have the equation \(3x = x\), which simplifies to \(3 = 1\). This is not possible, so there seems to be an error in the problem setup.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let the height of the penguin be \(h\) meters. The depth the penguin reaches is \(4h\) meters. Since the penguin takes 28 seconds to reach this depth, we can use the formula \(d = \frac{1}{2}gt^2\) where \(d\) is the depth, \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \(t\) is the time in seconds. 

Substitute \(d = 4h\), \(g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2\), and \(t = 28\) into the formula to get \(4h = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times 28^2\).

Solving for \(h\), we get \(h = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times 28^2 \div 4 = 1916\).

The square of the depth the penguin reaches in seconds is \(4h)^2 = (4 \times 1916)^2 = 30656^2 = \boxed{939,393,536}\).
