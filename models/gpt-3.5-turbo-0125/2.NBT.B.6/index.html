Finally, he rotates it by another 66 degrees to form shape 'n'. What is the total degree measure of the rotations made to get shape 'n'?

            In the previous problem, we learned that Jack swung 57 times more than Sally. But what if Jack had only swung 46 times more than Sally? Sally still swung 57 times. If Jack then swung 46 more times than Sally, and Xavier again swung 92 times more than Jack, how many swings would Xavier have taken in this case?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this case, if Jack swung 46 times more than Sally, then Jack swung \(57 + 46 = 103\) times.
Xavier swung 92 times more than Jack, so Xavier swung \(103 + 92 = 195\) times.

- On the second day, he ate twice that amount, which is 15*2 = 30 ice creams.
- If on the third day he ate 32 more than the number of ice creams he had on the second day, then he ate 30+32 = 62 ice creams on the third day.

            Following on from the previous scenario with the orange seller: suppose that the seller initially had only 9 boxes of orange but on the subsequent day, he added 22 new boxes as before. However, instead of adding 26 boxes to total on the third day this time, he adds 66 boxes. How many boxes of oranges does the store have now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
- On the first day, the store has 9 boxes.
- On the second day, the store has 9 + 22 = 31 boxes.
- On the third day, the store has 31 + 66 = 97 boxes.

Therefore, the store has 97 boxes of oranges now.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's denote the number of sandwiches Kevin made as \( x \). The total number of sandwiches made by Sarah and Kevin is \( 80 + x \). We are given that this total is 33 more than the number of sandwiches made by Sarah, so we can write the equation:

\[ 80 + x = 80 + 33 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 33 \]

Therefore, Kevin made \( x = \boxed{33} \) sandwiches.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Mike's left binocular lens can magnify objects from a distance of 30 miles away, and the right lens can magnify objects that are 56 miles away. He also has a telescope that can magnify objects from a distance of 67 miles away. What is the total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The left binocular lens can magnify objects from 30 miles away, the right lens from 56 miles away, and the telescope from 67 miles away. The total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects is 30 + 56 + 67 = 153 miles.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous problem, we considered the distance that Mike's binocular's two lenses can magnify. Consider now that we made a mistake and that the left lens can actually magnify objects from a distance of 54 miles away instead of 30 miles. Keeping the right lense and the telescope the same at 56 and 67 miles respectively, what would be the new total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: With the corrected distance for the left binocular lens at 54 miles, the total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects is 54 + 56 + 67 = 177 miles.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the land of the Wizarding World, one wand spells costs 50 magical crystals known as Quiblets. Quintus the wizard adds 5 Quiblets more to this to cast a slightly stronger spell. This amount is then topped up by 25 magical Quiblets to cast the most powerful spell. How many Quiblets does Quintus the wizard need to cast the most powerful spell?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Quintus needs 50 + 5 = &lt;&lt;50+5=55&gt;&gt;55 Quiblets for the slightly stronger spell.
For the most powerful spell, Quintus needs 55 + 25 = &lt;&lt;55+25=80&gt;&gt;80 Quiblets.

            As an extension to the previous problem, let's say Quintus the wizard then decides to cast an ancient and profound spell. To cast this spell, he needs to gather an additional number of Quiblets equivalent to his most powerful spell, plus 50 more. How many Quiblets does Quintus the wizard need in total to cast this ancient spell?

            As a variation to the previous problem, let's say the most powerful spell that Quintus the wizard wants to cast actually requires an additional 87 Quiblets on top of the slightly stronger spell, not just 25. How many Quiblets does he now need to cast this more demanding powerful spell?
