In the first half minute, the machine blows 325 bubbles, so in one second it blows 325 bubbles/30 seconds = 10.83... bubbles/second.
Therefore, in the second half minute, the machine blows 7.33... bubbles/second - 10.83... bubbles/second = -3.5 bubbles/second.

            <span class="response-field">GPT-3.5 Turbo:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the original count of pieces before adding the last set, we need to subtract the number of pieces in the last set. Since Mary adds pieces in sets of 4, the last set would have 276 % 4 = &lt;&lt;276%4=0&gt;&gt;0 pieces.
Therefore, the original count of pieces before adding the last set was 276 - 4 = &lt;&lt;276-4=272&gt;&gt;272 pieces.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The amount charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads is the total cost of the watch minus the manufacturing cost. So, $422 - $200 = $222 is charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads.
