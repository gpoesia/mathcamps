            During the drummer's next performance, he manages to play a total of 906 beats. If he played exactly the same solo as the last time when he missed 39 beats from a total of 379, how many additional beats did he add to his performance this time?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first find out how many beats the drummer played in the previous performance without missing any beats. We know that he played 379 beats in total and missed 39 beats, so he actually played 379 - 39 = 340 beats in the previous performance.

Now, in his next performance, he played a total of 906 beats. Since he played 340 beats in the previous performance, he added 906 - 340 = 566 beats to his performance this time.

            Continuing from our previous problem, the ballerina, later in the evening, decided to add to her routine and performed some more pirouettes. However, she was a bit tired and was unable to count exactly how many she did. She only knew that after those additional pirouettes, the total number of pirouettes she did for the day was 314 less than if she had doubled the number of pirouettes she performed before dinner. How many pirouettes did she do after dinner?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's denote the number of pirouettes the ballerina did after dinner as \( x \). We know that the total number of pirouettes she did for the day was 575 + x. We are also given that this total is 314 less than if she had doubled the number of pirouettes she performed before dinner, which is 2 * 575 = 1150.

So, we can set up the equation:
575 + x = 1150 - 314

Solving for x:
x = 1150 - 314 - 575
x = 261

Therefore, the ballerina did 261 pirouettes after dinner.

            Jack is a professional mountain climber. He has a rope that is 623 meters long. He buys an additional rope to make sure he is prepared for any situation. The total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. What is the total length of the two ropes?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let x be the length of the additional rope.
The total length of both ropes is x + 623.
According to the problem, x + 623 = 623 + 377.
Therefore, x = 377.
So, the total length of the two ropes is 623 + 377 = 1000 meters.

            Now, let's change the scenario a bit. Suppose originally, Jack had a shorter rope that was 472 meters long.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let x be the length of the additional rope.
The total length of both ropes is x + 472.
According to the problem, x + 472 = 472 + 377.
