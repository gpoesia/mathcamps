    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width).
Given that the length is 21m and the width is 37m, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the perimeter:

        One side of a rectangle is four times the length of the other side. If the longer side measures 39 meters, what is the area of the rectangle when the shorter side is 10 meters?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let the shorter side of the rectangle be \( x \) meters. Since one side of the rectangle is four times the length of the other side, the longer side is \( 4x \) meters. Given that the longer side is 39 meters, we have:

\[ 4x = 39 \]
\[ x = \frac{39}{4} = 9.75 \text{ meters} \]

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: \( \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \). Therefore, the area of the rectangle when the shorter side is 10 meters and the longer side is 39 meters is:

\[ \text{Area} = 10 \times 39 = 390 \text{ square meters} \]

        Suppose we resized the rectangle and shortened its length from 35m to 19m, while keeping the width the same. What would the new perimeter of the rectangle be?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The new length of the rectangle is 19m, and the width remains 9m.
Using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, P = 2(length + width), we substitute the new length and the width into the formula: P = 2(19 + 9) = 2(28) = 56m.

        A rectangle has a length of 38m and a width of 11m. What is the perimeter of this rectangle?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2*(length + width).
Given that the length is 38m and the width is 11m, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the perimeter.
P = 2*(38 + 11) = 2*(49) = 98m.

        In the rectangle mentioned earlier, suppose we now construct another rectangle such that its length remains the same (38m), but the width is now 23m instead of 11m. How would the perimeter of this new rectangle be calculated?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of the new rectangle with a length of 38m and a width of 23m can be calculated using the same formula as before: P = 2*(length + width).
Substitute the new width value into the formula: P = 2*(38 + 23) = 2*(61) = 122m.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = length x width. In this case, the length is 28m and the width is 29m. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 28m x 29m = &lt;&lt;28*29=812&gt;&gt;812 square meters.
