            In the previous problem, you multiplied the fraction 3/7 by the fraction 26/6. Now, let's change the fraction a bit. Instead of 3/7, use 7/7 (which is actually 1). Multiply this new fraction 7/7 by the same fraction 26/6. What is the result of this new calculation, expressed as a simplified fraction?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: When we multiply any fraction by 1, the result is the same fraction. 

(7/7) * (26/6) = 26/6

To simplify the fraction 26/6, we find the greatest common divisor of 26 and 6, which is 2. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get:

26 / 6 = 13 / 3

            The previous problem involved calculating (9 / 7) * (25 / 30). Now calculate (9 / 7) * (25 / 21) which is similar but with a slight change in the second fraction. What simplified fraction do you get in this scenario?

            <span class="response-field">GPT-3.5 Turbo:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together separately. 

(9/7) * (25/21) = (9 * 25) / (7 * 21) = 225 / 147

The fraction 225/147 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

225 Ã· 3 = 75
147 Ã· 3 = 49

Therefore, 225/147 simplifies to 75/49.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to multiply (45/13) by (8/14):

(45/13) * (8/14) = (45*8) / (13*14) = 360 / 182.

To simplify the fraction 360/182, we find that both numbers are divisible by 2:

360 Ã· 2 = 180
182 Ã· 2 = 91

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 180/91.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first find the result of the operation ((21 / 16) / (27 / 23)), which we found to be 161/144. 

Now, to square this result, we simply square both the numerator and the denominator:

(161/144)^2 = (161^2) / (144^2) = 25921 / 20736

Therefore, the value of the new operation, after squaring the result of ((21 / 16) / (27 / 23)), is 25921/20736.

            Given the previous problem where we multiplied and squared the result of ((21 / 16) / (27 / 23)), let's consider a new scenario. What would be the result if, instead of 21 / 16, we had 6? So, the new calculation would be (6 / (27 / 23)). Write the result as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: If we substitute 6 for 21/16 in the expression (6 / (27 / 23)), we get:

6 / (27 / 23) = 6 * (23 / 27) = 6 * 23 / 27 = 138 / 27

The fraction 138/27 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

138 Ã· 3 = 46
27 Ã· 3 = 9

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 46/9.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we multiply the fractions (21/26) * (20/9):

(21/26) * (20/9) = (21 * 20) / (26 * 9) = 420 / 234 = 70 / 39

Next, we multiply the result by the fraction (15/21):

(70/39) * (15/21) = (70 * 15) / (39 * 21) = 1050 / 819

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of 1050 and 819, which is 3.

1050 / 819 = (1050 / 3) / (819 / 3) = 350 / 273

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we multiply the fractions:
(16/6) * (29/27) = (16*29) / (6*27) = 464 / 162.

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of 464 and 162, which is 2. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get:
464 / 162 = 232 / 81.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many gallons of petrol the car will consume for the entire drive, we need to multiply the consumption rate per mile by the length of the route.

Consumption rate per mile: 16/10 gallons

Total consumption = (16/10) * (13/17) = (16*13)/(10*17) = 208/170 = 104/85
