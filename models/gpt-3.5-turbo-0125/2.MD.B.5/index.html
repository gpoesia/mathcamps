        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total length of the stack of bricks is 10 inches/brick * (number of bricks) = 10 inches/brick * (number of original bricks + 1 additional brick) = 10 inches/brick * (1 + 1) = 10 inches/brick * 2 = 20 inches.
Adding the 9-inch brick to the stack will result in a total length of 20 inches + 9 inches = 29 inches.
