        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 8. 

(1/8) is equivalent to (1/8) * (1/1) = 1/8.

(4/1) is equivalent to (4/1) * (8/8) = 32/8.

So, the comparison is:

1/8 _ 32/8.

Since 1 is less than 32, the comparison is:

1/8 &lt; 32/8.

Now we have 6 _ 1. Since 6 is greater than 1, the relationship is 6 &gt; 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To compare the two fractions, we need to simplify them first.

(6 / 1) = 6
(4 / 3) = 4/3

Now we have 6 _ 4/3. To compare these, we can convert 6 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:

6 = 18/3

Now we have 18/3 _ 4/3. Since 18 is greater than 4, the relationship is 18/3 &gt; 4/3.

Comparing this result to the previous one, we see that 6 is greater than 1, and 18/3 is greater than 4/3. Therefore, the results are consistent.

            Consider the follow-up question:

Now let's change our fractional values. Instead of comparing 2/9 to a whole, as in the previous problem, let's compare it to 5/8. Fill in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =.

(2 / 9) _ (5 / 8)
        </p>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions (2/9) and (5/8), we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 9 and 8 is 72.

Converting the fractions to have a common denominator:
(2/9) = (2*8 / 9*8) = 16/72
(5/8) = (5*9 / 8*9) = 45/72

Now we can compare the fractions:
16/72 &lt; 45/72

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions (3/4) and (6/9), we can simplify the fractions first.

Simplifying (6/9):
(6/9) = (2*3) / (3*3) = 2/3

Now we can compare the fractions:
(3/4) _ (2/3)

To compare these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12.

Converting the fractions to have a common denominator of 12:
(3/4) = (3/4) * (3/3) = 9/12
(2/3) = (2/3) * (4/4) = 8/12

Now we can compare the fractions:
9/12 _ 8/12
Since 9 is greater than 8, we have:
9/12 &gt; 8/12

If the second fraction were (6/9) instead of (6/5), the comparison would change to:
(3/4) &gt; (6/9)
This is because 6/9 simplifies to 2/3, which is less than 3/4.

            Let's consider a slight change to our earlier comparison. What if instead of having 8 out of 10 parts, you now have 8 divided by 2 parts? 

Fill in the blank with the correct symbol to compare the following fractions:

(8 / 2) _ (1 / 1)
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions (8/2) and (1/1), we need to find a symbol that represents the relationship between the two fractions.

First, we simplify the fractions:
8/2 = 4
1/1 = 1

Now, we can see that 4 is greater than 1. Therefore, the correct symbol to compare the fractions is &gt; (greater than).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the two fractions, we need to make sure they have the same denominator. 

First, we need to rewrite 2/10 as an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 7. To do this, we multiply the numerator and denominator of 2/10 by 7:

2/10 = (2*7) / (10*7) = 14/70

Now we can compare the fractions:

5/7 = 50/70
14/70

Since 50/70 is less than 14/70, we have:

5/7 &lt; 14/70

            Consider the modified question from before, but this time with different values in the fractions:

(6 / 9) _ (5 / 1)

Fill in the blank in the question with &lt;, &gt;, or = to correctly compare the two fractions. Just like we compared the earlier fractions, can you tell which of these two fractions is greater?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 9 and 1 is 9.

Converting the fractions to have a common denominator:
6/9 = 6/9
5/1 = 5*9/1*9 = 45/9

Now we can compare the fractions:
6/9 &lt; 45/9

Converting the fractions to have a common denominator:
4/6 = 4/6 = 2/3

10/6 = 5/3

Now we have:
2/3 &lt; 5/3

When we increase the numerator in the second fraction from 6 to 5, the second fraction becomes larger than the first fraction.

So, we have 3/5 _ 9/10.

To compare these fractions, we can cross multiply: 3 * 10 = 30 and 5 * 9 = 45.
