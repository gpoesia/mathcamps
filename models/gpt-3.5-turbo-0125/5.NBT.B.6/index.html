            If the astronaut's mission got extended to 124 days instead of 90, and he still used a total of 3870 liters of oxygen, how much oxygen did he use daily?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let \( x \) be the daily oxygen consumption.

The total oxygen consumption over 124 days is \( 124x \), and we know that this is equal to 3870 liters.

So, we have the equation \( 124x = 3870 \).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{3870}{124} = 31.25 \text{ liters/day} \]

Therefore, the astronaut used 31.25 liters of oxygen daily.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let \( x \) be the number of hats the hat maker produces weekly in the following year. We can set up the equation \( 57x = 7678 \) to represent the total number of hats made over 57 weeks in the following year.

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 57x = 7678 \]
\[ x = \frac{7678}{57} \]
\[ x = 134 \]

Therefore, the hat maker now produces 134 hats weekly.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of waves on the redesigned slide, we need to divide the new total length of the slide by the length of each wave.

Number of waves = 3769 inches / 56 inches = 67 waves.

### Answer: 67 waves.</pre>
