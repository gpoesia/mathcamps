            Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve for q and s.

Multiplying the first equation by 12 and the second equation by 91, we get:

1. 480s - 1092q = 444
2. 2730s + 1092q = 11011

Adding the two equations together, we get:

480s - 1092q + 2730s + 1092q = 444 + 11011
3300s = 11455
s = 11455 / 3300
s = 3.475

Substitute s = 3.475 back into the first equation to solve for q:

40 * 3.475 - 91q = 37
139 - 91q = 37
-91q = -102
q = -102 / -91
q = 1.122

Therefore, q = 1.122 and s = 3.475.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations:
1. 4b + 44m = 180
2. 79m - 6b = 48

Let's first simplify the equations:
1. b + 11m = 45
2. 79m - 6b = 48

Let's solve the first equation for b:
b = 45 - 11m

Now substitute b in the second equation:
79m - 6(45 - 11m) = 48
79m - 270 + 66m = 48
145m = 318
m = 318/145
m = 2.1931

Now substitute m back into the first equation to find b:
b = 45 - 11(2.1931)
b = 45 - 24.1241
b = 20.8759

Therefore, the values of b and m are:

Given equations:
1) 42o - 15g = 28
2) 47o + 29g = 141

To eliminate g, let's multiply equation 1 by 29 and equation 2 by 15:
1) 42o * 29 - 15g * 29 = 28 * 29
2) 47o * 15 + 29g * 15 = 141 * 15

This simplifies to:
1) 1218o - 435g = 812
2) 705o + 435g = 2115

Now, add the two equations to eliminate g:
1218o - 435g + 705o + 435g = 812 + 2115
1923o = 2927
o = 2927 / 1923
o = 1.52

Substitute o back into equation 1 to solve for g:
42 * 1.52 - 15g = 28
63.84 - 15g = 28
-15g = 28 - 63.84
-15g = -35.84

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve for v and o.

First, we will multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of &quot;o&quot; the same:

5 * ((12v - 6o) = 21) becomes 60v - 30o = 105
2 * ((76v - 45o) = 50) becomes 152v - 90o = 100

Now, we will subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate &quot;o&quot;:

(152v - 90o) - (60v - 30o) = 100 - 105
92v - 60o = -5

Now, we can solve this new equation for v:

92v = 60o - 5
v = (60o - 5) / 92

Since we have an expression for v in terms of o, we cannot determine a specific value for v and o without additional information or constraints.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the values of \( f \) and \( g \), we can solve the system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
75f + 25g = 138 \\
2f + 90g = 143
\end{cases}
\]

We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 75 to eliminate \( f \):

\[
\begin{cases}
150f + 50g = 276 \\
150f + 6750g = 10725
\end{cases}
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

\( 6750g - 50g = 10725 - 276 \)

\( 6700g = 10449 \)

\( g = \frac{10449}{6700} \)

\( g = 1.56 \)

Substitute \( g = 1.56 \) back into the first equation:

\( 75f + 25(1.56) = 138 \)

\( 75f + 39 = 138 \)

\( 75f = 99 \)

\( f = \frac{99}{75} \)

\( f = 1.32 \)

Therefore, the values of \( f \) and \( g \) are \( f = 1.32 \) and \( g = 1.56 \).

Given equations:
1) 194 = 4y + 14n
2) 7 = 65n - 79y

To eliminate y, let's multiply the first equation by 79 and the second equation by 4:
79 * 194 = 79 * 4y + 79 * 14n
4 * 7 = 4 * 65n - 4 * 79y

This simplifies to:
15326 = 316y + 1106n
28 = 260n - 316y

Now, let's multiply the second equation by 1106 and the first equation by 28:
1106 * 28 = 1106 * 260n - 1106 * 316y
28 * 194 = 28 * 4y + 28 * 14n

This simplifies to:
30968 = 287360n - 349808y
5372 = 112y + 392n

Now, we have the system of equations:
1) 15326 = 316y + 1106n
2) 5372 = 112y + 392n

Let's multiply the second equation by 1106 and the first equation by 112:
1106 * 5372 = 1106 * 112y + 1106 * 392n
112 * 15326 = 112 * 316y + 112 * 1106n

This simplifies to:
5941432 = 119072y + 2096512n
1715872 = 35472y + 124672n

Now, we have the system of equations:
1) 5941432 = 119072y + 2096512n
2) 1715872 = 35472y + 124672n

Let's subtract the second equation from the first equation:
5941432 - 1715872 = 119072y - 35472y + 2096512n - 124672n
4225560 = 83600y + 1971840n

Now, we have:
4225560 = 83600y + 1971840n

Given equations:
1) 146 = 28g + 26l
2) 6 = 41l - 53g

To eliminate one variable, let's multiply the second equation by 26 and the first equation by 53:
26 * 6 = 26 * 41l - 26 * 53g
53 * 146 = 53 * 28g + 53 * 26l

This simplifies to:
156 = 1066l - 1378g
7718 = 1484g + 1378l

Now we have the system:
1) 156 = 1066l - 1378g
2) 7718 = 1484g + 1378l

Let's solve this system of equations:
Multiply equation 1 by 1484 and equation 2 by 1066:
1) 156 * 1484 = 1066 * 1484l - 1378 * 1484g
2) 7718 * 1066 = 1484 * 7718g + 1378 * 7718l

This simplifies to:

8233948 = 8240152g + 10600204l

Now we have the system:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve this system.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 11 to make the coefficients of k the same:

6d + 69k = 96
11(6d + 69k) = 11(96)
66d + 759k = 1056

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate k:

72k - 22d = 17
-(66d + 759k = 1056)
---------------------
6d - 687k = -1039

Now, we can solve this new equation for d:

6d - 687k = -1039
6d = 687k - 1039
d = (687/6)k - 1039/6
d = 114.5k - 173.17

Now, we can substitute this expression for d back into one of the original equations to solve for k. Let's use the first equation:

72k - 22(114.5k - 173.17) = 17
72k - 2519k + 3800.74 = 17
-2447k = -3783.74
k = 1.547

Now that we have found the value of k, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for d:

d = 114.5(1.547) - 173.17
d = 178.02 - 173.17

Multiplying the first equation by 10 and the second equation by 33, we get:

1) 730 * h - 330 * d = 480
2) 330 * d + 462 * h = 3003

Adding the two equations together, we get:

730 * h - 330 * d + 330 * d + 462 * h = 480 + 3003
1192 * h = 3483
h = 3483 / 1192
h = 3

Substitute h = 3 back into the first equation:

73 * 3 - 33 * d = 48
219 - 33 * d = 48
-33 * d = -171
d = -171 / -33

From the second equation, we can express r in terms of a:
6r = 109 - 37a
r = (109 - 37a) / 6

Now, substitute this expression for r into the first equation:
53 = 89((109 - 37a) / 6) - 74a
53 = (89/6)(109 - 37a) - 74a
53 = (801 - 267a) - 74a
53 = 801 - 341a
341a = 801 - 53
341a = 748
a = 748 / 341
a = 2

Now, substitute the value of a back into the expression for r:
r = (109 - 37*2) / 6
r = (109 - 74) / 6
r = 35 / 6
r = 5.83 (rounded to two decimal places)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's set up a system of equations based on the given information:

1. 42g + 12q = 169
2. 12q - 50g = 19

To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply the second equation by 6 to make the coefficients of 'q' the same in both equations:

72q - 300g = 114

Now, we can add the modified second equation to the first equation:

42g + 12q + 72q - 300g = 169 + 114
-258g + 84q = 283
258g - 84q = -283

Now, we can solve for 'g':

258g = 84q - 283
g = (84q - 283) / 258

Substitute this expression for 'g' back into the first equation to solve for 'q':

42((84q - 283) / 258) + 12q = 169
(3528q - 11826 + 3096q) / 258 = 169
(6624q - 11826) / 258 = 169
6624q - 11826 = 169 * 258
6624q = 43542
q = 43542 / 6624
q = 6.57

Now, substitute 'q' back into the expression we found for 'g':

g = (84(6.57) - 283) / 258
g = (552.28 - 283) / 258
g = 269.28 / 258

Multiplying the first equation by 62 and the second equation by 11, we get:

(37 * 62) * s - (11 * 62) * v = 54 * 62
(82 * 11) * s - (62 * 11) * v = 41 * 11

This simplifies to:

2294s - 682v = 3348
902s - 682v = 451

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

2294s - 902s = 3348 - 451
1392s = 2897
s = 2897 / 1392
s = 2.08

Substitute s = 2.08 back into the first equation:

37 * 2.08 - 11v = 54
77.36 - 11v = 54
-11v = 54 - 77.36
-11v = -23.36
v = -23.36 / -11

2) 78z - 48c = 48

Let's first solve equation 2 for z:
78z - 48c = 48
78z = 48c + 48
z = (48c + 48) / 78
z = 48(c + 1) / 78
z = 16(c + 1) / 26
z = 8(c + 1) / 13

Now substitute this expression for z into equation 1:
41c + 65(8(c + 1) / 13) = 151
41c + 520(c + 1) / 13 = 151
41c + 520c/13 + 520/13 = 151
41c + 40c + 40 = 151
81c + 40 = 151
81c = 111
c = 111 / 81
c = 37 / 27

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's denote the variables as follows:

v = number of times 'v' appears
d = number of times 'd' appears

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

25v + 69d = 113   (Equation 1)
26d + 42v = 85     (Equation 2)

To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply Equation 1 by 2 and Equation 2 by -3 to eliminate 'v':

2(25v + 69d) = 2(113)
52v + 138d = 226   (Equation 3)

-3(26d + 42v) = -3(85)
-78d - 126v = -255   (Equation 4)

Now, add Equation 3 and Equation 4:

52v + 138d - 78d - 126v = 226 - 255
-74v + 60d = -29

Divide by 2 to simplify:

-37v + 30d = -14

Now, we can solve for 'v' and 'd' by setting up a new system of equations:

-37v + 30d = -14   (Equation 5)
25v + 69d = 113     (Equation 6)

Let's solve this new system of equations:

Multiply Equation 5 by 25 and Equation 6 by 37 to eliminate 'v':

25(-37v + 30d) = 25(-14)
-925v + 750d = -350   (Equation 7)

37(25v + 69d) = 37(113)
925v + 2553d = 4181   (Equation 8)

Now, add Equation 7 and Equation 8:

-925v + 750d + 925v + 2553d = -350 + 4181
3303d = 3831

Divide by 3303 to solve for 'd':

d = 3831/3303
d = 1.16

Now, substitute d = 1.16 back into Equation 6 to solve for 'v':

25v + 69(1.16) = 113
25v + 80.04 = 113
25v = 32.96
v = 1.32

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve for g and z, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

1. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 91 to make the coefficients of z the same:
3(43z - 91g) = 3(33) -&gt; 129z - 273g = 99
91(72g - 3z) = 91(68) -&gt; 6552g - 273z = 6188

2. Add the two equations together to eliminate z:
129z - 273g + 6552g - 273z = 99 + 6188
-144g + 129z = 6287

3. Solve for z:
129z - 144g = 6287
129z = 144g + 6287
z = (144g + 6287) / 129

4. Substitute the expression for z back into one of the original equations to solve for g:
43((144g + 6287) / 129) - 91g = 33
6192g + 271541 - 91g = 4227
6188g = -267314
g = -267314 / 6188
g = -43

5. Substitute g = -43 back into the expression for z to solve for z:
z = (144(-43) + 6287) / 129
z = (-6192 + 6287) / 129
z = 95 / 129

            Alex's and Brad's baskets contained c cherries and f figs respectively. From an old recipe book, it stated that cherries multiplied by 50 multiplied by the quantity of figs that multiplied by 12, which altogether would weigh about 92 grams. Another recipe book stated that cherries multiplied by 36 minus figs multiplied by 21 should weigh about 34 grams. Can you find the quantity of cherries (c) and figs (f)? Use the following system of equations to solve:

50c + 12f = 92

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to eliminate c:

150c + 36f = 276
72c - 42f = 68

Adding the two equations together:

150c + 36f + 72c - 42f = 276 + 68
222c - 6f = 344
222c = 6f + 344
c = (6f + 344) / 222
c = (3f + 172) / 111

Substitute c back into the first equation:

50((3f + 172) / 111) + 12f = 92
(150f + 8600) / 111 + 12f = 92
150f + 8600 + 1332f = 10212
1482f = 1612
f = 1612 / 1482
f = 1.086

Substitute f back into c = (3f + 172) / 111:

c = (3(1.086) + 172) / 111
c = (3.258 + 172) / 111
c = 175.258 / 111
c = 1.578

Therefore, the quantity of cherries (c) is 1.578 and the quantity of figs (f) is 1.086.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve for u and d.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 85 and the second equation by 87 to make the coefficients of u the same:

1) 87u * 85 - 75d * 85 = 7 * 85
2) 85d * 87 - 82u * 87 = 54 * 87

This simplifies to:

1) 7395u - 6375d = 595
2) 7395d - 7134u = 4698

Now, let's multiply the first equation by 7395 and the second equation by 6375 to make the coefficients of d the same:

1) 7395u * 7395 - 6375d * 7395 = 595 * 7395
2) 6375d * 6375 - 7134u * 6375 = 4698 * 6375

This simplifies to:

1) 54748025u - 47150625d = 4406025
2) 40640625d - 45461250u = 29996250

Now, let's add the two new equations together to eliminate d:

54748025u - 47150625d + 40640625d - 45461250u = 4406025 + 29996250
9286795u = 34302275
u = 34302275 / 9286795
u = 3.69

Now, substitute u = 3.69 back into the first original equation to solve for d:

87(3.69) - 75d = 7
320.43 - 75d = 7
-75d = 7 - 320.43
-75d = -313.43
d = -313.43 / -75
d = 4.18

Using these equations, can you figure out the values of i and a for him?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's denote the unknown number a as \(a\) and the unknown number i as \(i\).

From the first equation, we have:
\[75a - 4i = 42\]

From the second equation, we have:
\[10i + 13a = 160\]

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of \(i\) and \(a\).

Multiplying the first equation by 10 and the second equation by 75, we get:
\[750a - 40i = 420\]
\[750a + 975i = 12000\]

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
\[1015i = 11580\]
\[i = \frac{11580}{1015} = 11.4\]

Substitute the value of \(i\) back into the second equation:
\[10(11.4) + 13a = 160\]
\[114 + 13a = 160\]
\[13a = 46\]
\[a = \frac{46}{13} = 3.54\]

Therefore, the values of i and a are \(i = 11.4\) and \(a = 3.54\).

2. Add the two equations together to eliminate f:

y = 1013/912 = 1.11 (rounded to two decimal places).

Now, substituting the value of y back into the first equation:
24z + 72 * 1.11 = 139,
24z + 79.92 = 139,
24z = 59.08,
z = 59.08/24 = 2.46 (rounded to two decimal places).

Therefore, the values of y and z are y = 1.11 and z = 2.46.

Given equations:
1) 87o - 29v = 1
2) 8v + 30o = 91

To eliminate v, let's multiply equation 1 by 8 and equation 2 by 29:
8(87o - 29v) = 8(1) =&gt; 696o - 232v = 8
29(8v + 30o) = 29(91) =&gt; 232v + 870o = 2639

Adding the two equations:
696o - 232v + 232v + 870o = 8 + 2639
1566o = 2647
o = 2647/1566
o = 1.688

Substitute o back into equation 1 to solve for v:
87(1.688) - 29v = 1
147.156 - 29v = 1
-29v = 1 - 147.156
-29v = -146.156
v = -146.156 / -29
v = 5.041

Given equations:

To eliminate h, we can multiply the second equation by 2 and add it to the first equation:

22p + 46h = 248

Adding this to the first equation:

1) 19d + 6f = 120

To eliminate f, we can multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 1:
1) 133d + 42f = 840

Adding the two equations together, we get:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve this system.

Multiplying equation (1) by 66 and equation (2) by 42, we get:

1) 2772m + 3630r = 8382
2) 2772m - 2184r = 1848

Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1), we get:

5814r = 6534
r = 6534/5814
r = 1.12

Substitute the value of r back into equation (1) to solve for m:

42m + 55(1.12) = 127
42m + 61.6 = 127
42m = 65.4
m = 65.4/42
m = 1.55

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve this system.

Given equations:
1) 31n + 64w = 120
2) 57w + 71n = 173

To eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the first equation by 57 and the second equation by 31:
1) 31(31n + 64w) = 31(120) =&gt; 961n + 1984w = 3720
2) 57(57w + 71n) = 57(173) =&gt; 3249w + 4077n = 9871

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate n:
3249w + 4077n - 961n - 1984w = 9871 - 3720
2093w + 3116n = 6151

Now, we can solve this new equation for w:
2093w = 6151 - 3116n
w = (6151 - 3116n) / 2093

Since we have two equations, we can substitute the expression for w back into one of the original equations to solve for n. Let's substitute it into the first equation:
31n + 64((6151 - 3116n) / 2093) = 120
31n + (64 * 6151 - 64 * 3116n) / 2093 = 120
31n + (393664 - 199424n) / 2093 = 120
31n + 188240 / 2093 - 199424n / 2093 = 120
31n + 90 - 95n = 120
-64n = 30
n = -30 / 64
n = -15 / 32

Now that we have found the value of n, we can substitute it back into the equation for w:
w = (6151 - 3116(-15/32)) / 2093
w = (6151 + 46740/32) / 2093
w = (6151 + 1460) / 2093
w = 7611 / 2093
w = 7611 / 2093

Multiplying the first equation by 11 and the second equation by 1, we get:

1) 583 * e + 77 * p = 1133
2) 69 * e - 88 * p = 6

Adding the two equations together, we get:

583 * e + 77 * p + 69 * e - 88 * p = 1133 + 6
652 * e - 11 * p = 1139

Solving for e, we get:

652 * e = 1139 + 11 * p
e = (1139 + 11 * p) / 652

Substitute this expression for e into the first equation:

53 * ((1139 + 11 * p) / 652) + 7 * p = 103
(60227 + 583 * p) / 652 + 7 * p = 103
60227 + 583 * p + 4524 * p = 67256
6107 * p = 7030
p = 7030 / 6107
p = 1.152

First, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of either p or s the same in both equations.

3 * ((18 * p) - (7 * s)) = 3 * 21
2 * ((51 * s) - (24 * p)) = 2 * 14

Simplifying, we get:
54p - 21s = 63
102s - 48p = 28

Now, let's multiply the first equation by 4 and add it to the second equation to eliminate p:

4(54p - 21s) + (102s - 48p) = 4(63) + 28
216p - 84s + 102s - 48p = 252 + 28
168p + 18s = 280

Rearranging the equation:
168p + 18s = 280
Dividing by 6:
28p + 3s = 46

Now, we have a new equation:
28p + 3s = 46
54p - 21s = 63

Let's multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of either p or s the same in both equations:

7(28p + 3s) = 7(46)
3(54p - 21s) = 3(63)

Simplifying, we get:
196p + 21s = 322
162p - 63s = 189

Now, let's add the two equations to eliminate s:

196p + 21s + 162p - 63s = 322 + 189
358p - 42s = 511

Dividing by 17:
21p - 2s = 29

Now we have two equations:
21p - 2s = 29
54p - 21s = 63

Multiplying the first equation by 21 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of s the same:

21(21p - 2s) = 21(29)
2(54p - 21s) = 2(63)

Solving these equations, we get:
441p - 42s = 609
108p - 42s = 126

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation:
441p - 108p = 609 - 126
333p = 483
p = 483/333
p = 161/111
p = 1.45

Substitute p back into one of the original equations to solve for s:
54s - 24(1.45) = 14
54s - 34.8 = 14
54s = 48.8
s = 48.8/54
s = 0.9

Therefore, the values of p and s that satisfy both equations are p = 1.45 and s = 0.9.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve for c and w.

Given equations:
1) 59c - 34w = 84
2) 11c + 42w = 98

To eliminate w, let's multiply equation 1 by 42 and equation 2 by 34:
1) 42(59c - 34w) = 42(84)
   2478c - 1428w = 3528

2) 34(11c + 42w) = 34(98)
   374c + 1428w = 3332

Now, add the two equations to eliminate w:
2478c - 1428w + 374c + 1428w = 3528 + 3332
2852c = 6860
c = 6860/2852
c = 2

Now, substitute c = 2 back into equation 1 to solve for w:
59(2) - 34w = 84
118 - 34w = 84
-34w = -34
w = 1

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is c = 2 and w = 1.

Multiplying the first equation by 42 and the second equation by 45, we get:

1) 45 * 42 * f + 42 * 42 * z = 42 * 101,
2) 45 * 60 * z - 42 * 45 * f = 45 * 13.

This simplifies to:

1) 1890f + 1764z = 4242,
2) 2700z - 1890f = 585.

Adding the two equations together, we get:

1890f - 1890f + 1764z + 2700z = 4242 + 585,
4464z = 4827,
z = 4827 / 4464,
z = 1.08.

Substitute z = 1.08 back into the first equation:

Multiplying equation 1 by 59 and equation 2 by 92, we get:

1) 92 * 59 * n - 38 * 59 * s = 59 * 62
2) 92 * 59 * n + 8 * 92 * s = 92 * 75

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get:

(92 * 59 * n + 8 * 92 * s) - (92 * 59 * n - 38 * 59 * s) = 92 * 75 - 59 * 62
Simplifying, we get:
92 * 59 * n + 8 * 92 * s - 92 * 59 * n + 38 * 59 * s = 6908
8 * 92 * s + 38 * 59 * s = 6908
736s + 2242s = 6908
2978s = 6908
s = 6908 / 2978
s = 2

Now, substitute s = 2 back into equation 1 to solve for n:

Multiplying the first equation by 58 and the second equation by 35 to make the coefficients of e the same:

1) 87z * 58 - 35e * 58 = 63 * 58

Adding the two equations together to eliminate e:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the method of substitution.

From the second equation, we can express n in terms of l:
n = 103 - 73l

Now, we substitute this expression for n into the first equation:
31 = 58l - (103 - 73l)
31 = 58l - 103 + 73l
31 = 131l - 103
31 + 103 = 131l
134 = 131l
l = 134/131

Now, we substitute the value of l back into the second equation to find n:
n = 103 - 73(134/131)
n = 103 - 9732/131
n = 103 - 74.3
n = 28.7

Therefore, the values of l and n are:
l = 134/131
n = 28.7

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve this system.

We will multiply the first equation by 37 and the second equation by 28 to make the coefficients of j the same and then subtract the equations to eliminate j.

Multiplying the first equation by 37:
37(29y - 28j) = 37(39)
1073y - 1036j = 1443

Multiplying the second equation by 28:
28(25y + 37j) = 28(116)
700y + 1036j = 3248

Subtracting the second equation from the first:
1073y - 1036j - (700y + 1036j) = 1443 - 3248
373y = -1805
y = -1805/373
y = -5

Now, substitute y = -5 back into one of the original equations to solve for j. Let's use the first equation:
29(-5) - 28j = 39
-145 - 28j = 39
-28j = 184
j = -184/28
j = -23/4

Therefore, the values of y and j that satisfy the system of equations are y = -5 and j = -23/4.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 96 and the second equation by 93 to make the coefficients of u the same:

1) 93u - 85a = 74  (multiply by 96)
   96(93u - 85a) = 96(74)
   8928u - 8160a = 7104

2) 96u + 17a = 186  (multiply by 93)
   93(96u + 17a) = 93(186)
   8928u + 1581a = 17358

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate u:

8928u + 1581a - (8928u - 8160a) = 17358 - 7104
1581a + 8160a = 10254
9741a = 10254
a = 10254/9741
a = 1.05

Substitute the value of a back into the first equation to solve for u:

First, let's multiply the first equation by 23 and the second equation by 61 to eliminate g:

(97 * u - 61 * g) * 23 = 15 * 23
(85 * u + 23 * g) * 61 = 186 * 61

This gives us:

2231u - 1403g = 345
5185u + 1403g = 11346

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate g:

2231u - 1403g + 5185u + 1403g = 345 + 11346
7416u = 11691

Dividing by 7416 on both sides, we get:

u = 11691 / 7416
u = 1.575

Now, substitute u back into one of the original equations to solve for g. Let's use the first equation:

97 * 1.575 - 61g = 15
152.775 - 61g = 15
-61g = 15 - 152.775
-61g = -137.775

From the first equation:

Now, we can solve this system of equations using either substitution or elimination method.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve this system.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 8 and the first equation by 94 to make the coefficients of u the same:

8(71w - 94u) = 8(8)  
568w - 752u = 64  

94(8w + 68u) = 94(170)  
752w + 6392u = 15980  

Now, we have the system of equations:
568w - 752u = 64,  
752w + 6392u = 15980.  

Adding the two equations together, we get:
1320w + 5640u = 16044.  

Dividing by 1320, we get:
w + 4.27u = 12.2.  

Now, we can solve for w in terms of u:
w = 12.2 - 4.27u.  

Substitute this expression for w into the first equation:
8(12.2 - 4.27u) + 68u = 170,  
97.6 - 34.16u + 68u = 170,  
33.84u = 72.4,  
u = 2.14.  

Now, substitute u = 2.14 back into w = 12.2 - 4.27u:
w = 12.2 - 4.27(2.14),  
w = 12.2 - 9.15,  
w = 3.05.  

Therefore, the values of u and w that satisfy the system of equations are u = 2.14 and w = 3.05.  
### Answer: u = 2.14, w = 3.05.</pre>

Multiplying the first equation by 97 and the second equation by 8, we get:

(97)(68*r + 8*f) = 97*92
(8)(97*f + 38*r) = 8*182

Expanding, we get:

6604r + 776f = 8924
776f + 304r = 1456

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

6300r = 7468
r = 7468/6300
r = 118/100
r = 1.18

Substitute r = 1.18 into the first equation:

68*1.18 + 8f = 92
80.24 + 8f = 92
8f = 11.76

            Given the equations below, find the values of r and d:

For the first equation, consider 67 apples, each worth d dollars, and 37 ragdolls, each worth r dollars. If the total value of all these items is $50, you can represent this situation with the equation 67d - 37r = 50.

In another case, consider 39 ragdolls, each worth r dollars, and 21 apples, each worth d dollars. If the total value of all these items is $16, you can also represent this situation with the equation 39r - 21d = 16.

From these two equations, find the values of d (the cost of each apple) and r (the cost of each ragdoll).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the values of d and r, we can solve the system of equations:

1) 67d - 37r = 50
2) 39r - 21d = 16

To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply the first equation by 21 and the second equation by 37 to make the coefficients of d the same:

1) 67d*21 - 37r*21 = 50*21
2) 39r*37 - 21d*37 = 16*37

Simplify the equations:

1) 1407d - 777r = 1050
2) 1443r - 777d = 592

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate d:

1407d - 777r + 1443r - 777d = 1050 + 592
630d + 666r = 1642

Divide by 6 to simplify:

105d + 111r = 274

Now, we have a new equation:

3) 105d + 111r = 274

We can now solve this equation along with one of the original equations to find the values of d and r. Let's use the first equation:

67d - 37r = 50

Rearrange the equation to solve for d:

67d = 37r + 50
d = (37r + 50) / 67

Now substitute this expression for d into equation 3:

105((37r + 50) / 67) + 111r = 274
(105*37r + 105*50) / 67 + 111r = 274
(3885r + 5250) / 67 + 111r = 274
(3885r + 5250 + 7377r) / 67 = 274
11262r + 5250 = 18358
11262r = 13108
r = 13108 / 11262
r = 1.163

Now substitute r back into the equation to find d:

67d = 37(1.163) + 50
67d = 43.031 + 50
67d = 93.031
d = 93.031 / 67
d = 1.388

Therefore, the cost of each apple (d) is $1.39 and the cost of each ragdoll (r) is $1.16.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations:

1) 163 = 50x + a
2) 24 = 98x - 84a

To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method:

Multiply the first equation by 84 and the second equation by a to eliminate the variable a:

1) 163*84 = 50*84x + 84a
2) 24a = 98a*x - 84a^2

Now, we have:

1) 13692 = 4200x + 84a
2) 24a = 98x - 84a

Now, let's multiply the second equation by 84:

3) 2016 = 8232x - 7056a

Now, we have the following system of equations:

1) 13692 = 4200x + 84a
2) 2016 = 8232x - 7056a

Let's solve this system of equations:

From equation 1:
84a = 13692 - 4200x
a = (13692 - 4200x) / 84
a = 163 - 50x

Substitute a = 163 - 50x into equation 2:

2016 = 8232x - 7056(163 - 50x)
2016 = 8232x - 114048 + 352800x
2016 = 360032x - 114048
360032x = 2016 + 114048
360032x = 116064
x = 116064 / 360032
x = 0.3229

Now, substitute x = 0.3229 into a = 163 - 50x:

a = 163 - 50(0.3229)
a = 163 - 16.145
a = 146.855

Therefore, the values of x and a are x = 0.3229 and a = 146.855.

Multiplying the first equation by 44 and the second equation by 18, we get:
44 * (67 * p + 18 * b) = 44 * 110
18 * (82 * b - 44 * p) = 18 * 58

Simplifying, we get:
2948p + 792b = 4840
1476b - 792p = 1044

Now, let's add the two equations together to eliminate p:
2948p + 792b + 1476b - 792p = 4840 + 1044

1) 63c - 36e = 27
2) 8c + 32e = 69

To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method by multiplying the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of c the same:

1) 126c - 72e = 54
2) 8c + 32e = 69

Now, we can add the two equations together to eliminate c:
126c - 72e + 8c + 32e = 54 + 69
134c - 40e = 123

Now, we can solve for c:
134c - 40e = 123
134c = 40e + 123
c = (40e + 123) / 134

Now, we can substitute this expression for c into one of the original equations to solve for e. Let's use the first equation:
63c - 36e = 27
63((40e + 123) / 134) - 36e = 27
(2520e + 7629) / 134 - 36e = 27

-2304e = -4011
e = -4011 / -2304
e = 69/128

Now that we have found the value of e, we can substitute it back into the expression for c to find c:
c = (40 * (69/128) + 123) / 134
c = (2760/128 + 123) / 134
c = (21.5625 + 123) / 134

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve this system.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 43 and the second equation by 71 to make the coefficients of d the same:

(71d + 9j) * 43:
43(71d) + 43(9j) = 43(132)
3053d + 387j = 5676

(43j - 84d) * 71:
71(43j) - 71(84d) = 71(91)
3053j - 5976d = 6461

Now, we have the system of equations:
3053d + 387j = 5676
-5976d + 3053j = 6461

Let's add these two equations to eliminate d:
3053d - 5976d + 387j + 3053j = 5676 + 6461
-2923d + 3440j = 12137

Now, we can solve for j:
3440j = 12137 + 2923d
j = (12137 + 2923d) / 3440

Now, we can substitute this expression for j back into one of the original equations to solve for d. Let's substitute it into the first equation:

71d + 9((12137 + 2923d) / 3440) = 132
71d + (109233 + 26207d) / 3440 = 132
71d + 109233 + 26207d = 132 * 3440
71d + 26207d = 450720 - 109233
26278d = 341487
d = 341487 / 26278
d = 13

Now, substitute d = 13 back into the first equation to solve for j:
71(13) + 9j = 132
923 + 9j = 132
9j = 132 - 923
9j = -791
j = -791 / 9
j = -87.888...

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is d = 13 and j = -87.888....

Given equations:

Given equations:
1) 51*k - 8*i = 86
2) 39*i + 8*k = 193

To eliminate k, let's multiply equation 1 by 8 and equation 2 by -8:
1) 408*k - 64*i = 688
2) -312*i - 64*k = -1544

Adding the two equations together:
408*k - 64*i - 312*i - 64*k = 688 - 1544
344*k - 376*i = -856

Now, let's solve for k in terms of i:
344*k = 376*i - 856
k = (376*i - 856) / 344
k = (94*i - 214) / 86

Substitute this expression for k back into equation 1:
51*((94*i - 214) / 86) - 8*i = 86
(4794*i - 10914) / 86 - 8*i = 86
4794*i - 10914 - 688*i = 7396
4106*i = 18310
i = 18310 / 4106
i = 4.46

Now we substitute this expression for l into the first equation:

26m + 2142 - 1581m = 146
-1555m = -1996

m = 1.285

1) (8 * f) + (39 * h) = 66
2) (29 * f) + (46 * h) = 119

To eliminate 'f', we can multiply the first equation by 29 and the second equation by 8:

1) 29(8 * f) + 29(39 * h) = 29(66)
2) 8(29 * f) + 8(46 * h) = 8(119)

Simplify the equations:

1) 232f + 1131h = 1914
2) 232f + 368h = 952

Now, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate 'f':

232f - 232f + 1131h - 368h = 1914 - 952
763h = 962
h = 962 / 763
h = 2

\[
\begin{cases}

We can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 1 to eliminate \( b \):

\[
\begin{cases}
66b + 69k = 327 \\
62k - 69b = 14

Adding the two equations together, we get:

\( 66b + 69k + 62k - 69b = 327 + 14 \)

\( -3b + 131k = 341 \)

Solving for \( b \), we get:

\( -3b = 341 - 131k \)

\( b = \frac{131k - 341}{3} \)

Since \( b \) and \( k \) are integers, we need to find a value of \( k \) that makes \( b \) an integer. Let's try some values of \( k \) to find the corresponding \( b \):

For \( k = 3 \), \( b = \frac{131*3 - 341}{3} = \frac{393 - 341}{3} = \frac{52}{3} \) (not an integer)

1. \(6b + 5k = 105\)
2. \(95k - 51b = 67\)

To eliminate \(b\), we can multiply the first equation by 51 and the second equation by 5:

1. \(51(6b) + 51(5k) = 51(105)\) which simplifies to \(306b + 255k = 5355\)
2. \(5(95k) - 5(51b) = 5(67)\) which simplifies to \(475k - 255b = 335\)

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first:

\((306b + 255k) - (475k - 255b) = 5355 - 335\)

This simplifies to \(306b + 255k - 475k + 255b = 5020\)

Combining like terms, we get \(561b - 220k = 5020\)

Now, we can solve for \(b\) in terms of \(k\):

\(561b = 220k + 5020\)

\(b = \frac{220k + 5020}{561}\)

Now, we substitute this expression for \(b\) back into the first equation:

\(6\left(\frac{220k + 5020}{561}\right) + 5k = 105\)

Solving this equation will give us the value of \(k\), and then we can find the value of \(b\).

After solving the equations, we find that \(k = 9\) and \(b = 4\).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve for d and u.

Multiplying the first equation by 32 and the second equation by -33, we get:

(32)(33d) + (32)(62u) = (32)(114)
-33(32u) - 33(40d) = -33(83)

This simplifies to:
1056d + 1984u = 3648
-1056u - 1320d = -2739

Adding the two equations together, we get:
664u = 909
u = 909/664
u = 1.37

Substitute u = 1.37 back into the first equation:
33d + 62(1.37) = 114
33d + 85.94 = 114
33d = 28.06
d = 28.06/33
d = 0.85

Therefore, the values of d and u are d = 0.85 and u = 1.37.

Multiplying the first equation by 20 and the second equation by 5, we get:

100c + 560p = 2040   (Equation 1)
100c - 335p = 65     (Equation 2)

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1, we get:

(100c + 560p) - (100c - 335p) = 2040 - 65
100c + 560p - 100c + 335p = 1975
895p = 1975
p = 1975 / 895
p = 35/16

Substitute p = 35/16 into the first equation:

5c + 28(35/16) = 102
5c + 980/16 = 102
5c + 61.25 = 102
5c = 40.75
c = 40.75 / 5

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve for r and q.

Multiplying the first equation by 97 and the second equation by 58 to eliminate r:
(58 * r + 12 * q) * 97 = 147 * 97
(97 * q - 76 * r) * 58 = 76 * 58

Expanding the equations:
5626r + 1164q = 14259
5626q - 4408r = 4408

Now, we can solve this system of equations. Let's multiply the second equation by 1164 and add it to the first equation to eliminate r:
5626r + 1164q + 6546424q - 5099712r = 14259 + 5119712
6546424q - 5094086r = 5119971

Rearranging the equation:
6546424q - 5099712r = 5119971

Now, we have a new system of equations:
5626r + 1164q = 14259
6546424q - 5099712r = 5119971

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of elimination. 

First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to eliminate k:

2(47v - 3k) = 2(10) 
3(73v + 2k) = 3(128)

This simplifies to:
94v - 6k = 20 
219v + 6k = 384

Now, we can add the two equations together to eliminate k:
94v - 6k + 219v + 6k = 20 + 384
313v = 404
v = 404/313

Therefore, v = 404/313. 

Now, we can substitute the value of v back into one of the original equations to solve for k. Let's use the first equation:
47v - 3k = 10
47(404/313) - 3k = 10
18988/313 - 3k = 10
-3k = 10 - 18988/313
-3k = 3130/313 - 18988/313
-3k = -15858/313
k = (-15858/313) / -3
k = 5286/313

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's denote the first equation as:
89p - 41q = 60
And the second equation as:
27p + 91q = 124

To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve this system.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 27 and the second equation by 89 to make the coefficients of p the same:

27(89p - 41q) = 27(60)
89(27p + 91q) = 89(124)

This simplifies to:
2403p - 1147q = 1620
2403p + 8099q = 11036

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
9246q = 9424
q = 9424 / 9246
q = 1.02

Now, substitute q back into the first equation to solve for p:
89p - 41(1.02) = 60
89p - 41.82 = 60
89p = 101.82
p = 101.82 / 89
p = 1.14

First, let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of u the same:

3 * (88u - 96d) = 3 * 12
264u - 288d = 36

2 * (27u + 36d) = 2 * 71
54u + 72d = 142

Now, let's subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate u:

(264u - 288d) - (54u + 72d) = 36 - 142
210u - 360d = -106

Now, we can solve this new equation for u:

210u = 360d - 106
u = (360d - 106) / 210
u = 1.7143d - 0.5048

Now, we can substitute this expression for u back into one of the original equations to solve for d. Let's use the first equation:

88(1.7143d - 0.5048) - 96d = 12
151.4294d - 44.3744 - 96d = 12
55.4294d = 56.3744
d = 1.0182

Now that we have found d, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for u:

u = 1.7143(1.0182) - 0.5048
u = 1.7429 - 0.5048
u = 1.2381

Therefore, the values of u and d that make the equations true are u = 1.2381 and d = 1.0182.

To eliminate f, let's multiply equation 2 by 9 and equation 1 by 2:
2) 27n - 18f = 630
1) 40n - 36f = 18

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

Multiplying the first equation by 22 and the second equation by 7, we get:
154 * l + 2134 * j = 2926
154 * j + 259 * l = 532

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:
(154 * l + 2134 * j) - (154 * j + 259 * l) = 2926 - 532
154l + 2134j - 154j - 259l = 2394
-105l + 1980j = 2394
105l - 1980j = -2394

Now, let's solve this new equation:
105l - 1980j = -2394
Dividing by 15:
7l - 132j = -159.6

Now, we can solve for j:
7l - 132j = -159.6
-132j = -7l - 159.6
132j = 7l + 159.6
j = (7l + 159.6) / 132

Now, we substitute this expression for j back into one of the original equations to solve for l and then find j.

Let's substitute j back into the first equation:
7l + 97 * ((7l + 159.6) / 132) = 133
7l + (679l + 159.6*97) / 132 = 133
7l + (679l + 15463.2) / 132 = 133
7l + 5.1705l + 117.2 = 133
12.1705l = 15.8
l = 15.8 / 12.1705
l â‰ˆ 1.3

Now, substitute l back into j = (7l + 159.6) / 132 to find j:
j = (7*1.3 + 159.6) / 132
j = (9.1 + 159.6) / 132
j = 168.7 / 132
j â‰ˆ 1.28

2) 184d + 1932f = 3069

Adding the two equations together, we get:

Now, we can solve this new equation along with the first equation to find the values of d and f.

21d - 46f = 53

First, let's multiply the second equation by 11 to make the coefficients of w in both equations the same:

(66u - 68w) * 11 = 21 * 11
726u - 748w = 231

Now, we have the system of equations:
74u + 11w = 116
726u - 748w = 231

Adding the two equations together, we get:
800u = 347
u = 347/800
u = 0.43375

Now, substitute u back into the first equation to solve for w:
74(0.43375) + 11w = 116
32 + 11w = 116

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve this system.

Given equations:
1) 76f - 42j = 96
2) 47j + 34f = 136

To eliminate one variable, let's multiply the first equation by 47 and the second equation by 76:
1) 47 * (76f - 42j) = 47 * 96
   3572f - 1974j = 4512
2) 76 * (47j + 34f) = 76 * 136
   3572j + 2584f = 10336

Now, we have the equations:
1) 3572f - 1974j = 4512
2) 3572j + 2584f = 10336

Let's add these two equations to eliminate f:
3572f - 1974j + 3572j + 2584f = 4512 + 10336
6156f + 1598j = 14848

Now, we can solve for f:
6156f = 14848 - 1598j
f = (14848 - 1598j) / 6156
f = 2.4 - 0.26j

Now, we can substitute this value of f back into one of the original equations to solve for j. Let's substitute it into the first equation:
76 * (2.4 - 0.26j) - 42j = 96
182.4 - 19.76j - 42j = 96
182.4 - 61.76j = 96
-61.76j = -86.4
j = -86.4 / -61.76
j = 1.4

Now that we have found j, we can substitute it back into the equation f = 2.4 - 0.26j to find f:
f = 2.4 - 0.26 * 1.4
f = 2.4 - 0.364
f = 2.036

Therefore, the values of f and j that satisfy the system of equations are f = 2.036 and j = 1.4.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve this system.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 32 to make the coefficients of e in both equations the same:

32(63e - 69u) = 32(1)
2016e - 2208u = 32

Now, we can add this modified second equation to the first equation to eliminate u:

68u + 32e + 2016e - 2208u = 174 + 32
-2140u + 2048e = 206

Now, we can solve for e:

2048e = 2140u + 206
e = (2140u + 206) / 2048
e = 107u/1024 + 103/1024

Now, we substitute this expression for e back into the first equation:

68u + 32(107u/1024 + 103/1024) = 174
68u + 3424u/1024 + 3296/1024 = 174
68u + 3.34765625u + 3.21875 = 174
71.34765625u = 170.78125
u = 170.78125 / 71.34765625
u â‰ˆ 2.39

Now that we have found u, we can substitute it back into the second equation to find e:

63e - 69(2.39) = 1
63e - 167.91 = 1
63e = 168.91
e â‰ˆ 2.68

Therefore, the values of u and e are approximately u â‰ˆ 2.39 and e â‰ˆ 2.68.

Multiplying the first equation by 24 and the second equation by 57, we get:

(24 * 57p) + (24 * 4n) = 24 * 129
(57 * 24p) + (57 * 39n) = 57 * 154

This simplifies to:
1368p + 96n = 3096
1368p + 2223n = 8778

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
2223n - 96n = 8778 - 3096
2127n = 5682
n = 5682 / 2127
n = 2.67

Substitute n = 2.67 back into the first equation:
57p + 4(2.67) = 129
57p + 10.68 = 129
57p = 118.32
p = 118.32 / 57

Multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2, we get:

1) 198z - 132y = 96
2) 120y + 28z = 232

Now, let's multiply the second equation by 3 and subtract it from the first equation:

198z - 132y - 360y - 84z = 96 - 696
114z - 492y = -600
Dividing by 6:
19z - 82y = -100

Now, we have a new equation:
19z - 82y = -100

Now, we can solve this equation along with one of the original equations to find the values of y and z. Let's use the first equation:

66z - 44y = 32
Rearranging:
66z = 44y + 32
z = (44y + 32) / 66
z = (22y + 16) / 33

Substitute z = (22y + 16) / 33 into 19z - 82y = -100:

19((22y + 16) / 33) - 82y = -100
(418y + 304) / 33 - 82y = -100
418y + 304 - 33 * 82y = -3300
418y + 304 - 2706y = -3300
-2288y = -3604
y = -3604 / -2288
y = 157/251

Now, substitute y = 157/251 back into z = (22y + 16) / 33:

z = (22(157/251) + 16) / 33
z = (3454/251 + 16) / 33
z = (3454/251 + 16 * 251 / 251) / 33
z = (3454 + 4016) / 251 / 33
z = 7470 / 251 / 33
z = 30 / 251

Therefore, the values of y and z are y = 157/251 and z = 30/251.

Multiplying the first equation by 11 and the second equation by 58, we get:

(1) 11 * (83t - 58h) = 11 * 45
=&gt; 913t - 638h = 495

(2) 58 * (69h + 11t) = 58 * 124
=&gt; 4002h + 638t = 7192

Now, we can add equations (1) and (2) to eliminate t:

(913t - 638h) + (638t + 4002h) = 495 + 7192
=&gt; 1551t + 3364h = 7687

Now, we can solve this new equation for t:

1551t = 7687 - 3364h
t = (7687 - 3364h) / 1551

Now, we can substitute this expression for t back into one of the original equations to solve for h. Let's substitute it into the second equation:

69h + 11 * ((7687 - 3364h) / 1551) = 124
69h + (84557 - 36904h) / 1551 = 124

45.2h = 69.5
h = 69.5 / 45.2

2) 976h - 732o = 549

Now, subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
976h - 732o - 316h + 244o = 549 - 36
660h - 488o = 513
660h = 488o + 513
h = (488o + 513) / 660

Substitute the expression for h into the first equation:

First, let's multiply the first equation by 10 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of z the same:

1) 420d - 40z = 750
2) 80d + 90z = 324

Now, let's multiply the first equation by 9 and the second equation by 4 to make the coefficients of d the same:

1) 378d - 36z = 6750
2) 320d + 360z = 1296

Now, let's subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate d:

58d - 396z = 5454

Now, we can solve for z:

58d - 396z = 5454
-396z = 5454
z = -5454 / 396
z = -13.77

Now, substitute the value of z back into one of the original equations to solve for d. Let's use the first equation:

42d - 4z = 75
42d - 4(-13.77) = 75
42d + 55.08 = 75
42d = 19.92
d = 19.92 / 42
d = 0.47

Therefore, the values of d and z are d = 0.47 and z = -13.77.

### Answer: d = 0.47, z = -13.77.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve for 'a' and 'o'.

Multiplying the second equation by 4, we get:
(42 * a) + (6 * o) = 75
Multiplying by 4 gives:
4(42 * a) + 4(6 * o) = 4 * 75
168a + 24o = 300

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation:
(168a + 24o) - (42 * o + 24 * a) = 300 - 142
168a + 24o - 42o - 24a = 158
144a - 18o = 158
Dividing by 6:
24a - 3o = 26

Now, we have a system of equations:
42o + 24a = 142
24a - 3o = 26

Multiplying the second equation by 8:
8(24a - 3o) = 8 * 26
192a - 24o = 208

Adding this new equation to the first equation:
(42o + 24a) + (192a - 24o) = 142 + 208
168a = 350
a = 350 / 168
a = 2.0833

Substitute 'a' back into the second equation:
24(2.0833) - 3o = 26
50 - 3o = 26
-3o = -24
o = 8

Therefore, the values of 'a' and 'o' are:
a = 2.0833
o = 8

### Answer: a = 2.0833, o = 8.</pre>

Given equations:
1) 39r - 2p = 45
2) 16p - 84r = 36

To eliminate p, let's multiply equation 1 by 8 and equation 2 by 1:
1) 312r - 16p = 360
2) 16p - 84r = 36

Adding the two equations together, we get:
312r - 16p + 16p - 84r = 360 + 36
228r = 396
r = 396/228
r = 11/6

Substitute r = 11/6 into equation 1:
39(11/6) - 2p = 45
429/6 - 2p = 45
2p = 429/6 - 45
2p = 429/6 - 270/6

   - 52(64w - 8d) = 52(58)  =&gt;  3328w - 416d = 3016

2. Add the two equations together to eliminate 'd':

   -232d - 84w = 3072

3. Solve for 'd':
   -232d = 84w + 3072

To eliminate n, let's multiply equation 1 by 47 and equation 2 by 60:
1) 47(71z) + 47(60n) = 47(184) =&gt; 3337z + 2820n = 8648

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to solve for e and z.

Multiplying the second equation by 10 to make the coefficients of e the same:

\( 70e + 90z = 189 \) 
\( 990z - 840e = 200 \)

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:

\( 990z - 840e - (70e + 90z) = 200 - 189 \) 
\( 950z - 910e = 11 \) 

Now, we can solve for e in terms of z:

\( 910e = 950z - 11 \) 
\( e = \frac{950z - 11}{910} \)

Substitute this expression for e back into the first equation:

\( 70 * \left( \frac{950z - 11}{910} \right) + 90z = 189 \) 
\( \frac{66500z - 770}{910} + 90z = 189 \) 
\( 66500z - 770 + 81900z = 189 * 910 \) 
\( 148400z = 171990 \) 
\( z = \frac{171990}{148400} \) 
\( z = 1.159 \) 

Now, substitute z back into the expression for e:

\( e = \frac{950(1.159) - 11}{910} \) 
\( e = \frac{1101.05 - 11}{910} \) 
\( e = \frac{1090.05}{910} \) 
\( e = 1.2 \)

1) 26o - 44f = 95
2) 87f + 11o = 169

Let's multiply the first equation by 11 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of o the same:

1) 286o - 484f = 1045
2) 174f + 22o = 338

Now, let's add the two equations together to eliminate o:

286o - 484f + 174f + 22o = 1045 + 338
308o - 310f = 1383

Now, let's solve for o:

308o - 310f = 1383
308o = 310f + 1383
o = (310f + 1383) / 308

Now, we substitute this expression for o back into one of the original equations to solve for f. Let's use the first equation:

26((310f + 1383) / 308) - 44f = 95
(26 * 310f + 26 * 1383) / 308 - 44f = 95
(8060f + 35958) / 308 - 44f = 95
(8060f + 35958 - 13552f) / 308 = 95
(6708f + 35958) / 308 = 95
6708f + 35958 = 308 * 95
6708f + 35958 = 29840
6708f = 29840 - 35958
6708f = -6128
f = -6128 / 6708
f = -0.912

Now that we have found the value of f, we can substitute it back into the expression we found for o to find the value of o:

o = (310(-0.912) + 1383) / 308
o = (-284.52 + 1383) / 308
o = 1098.48 / 308
o = 3.566

Multiplying the first equation by 3, we get:
120z - 60p = 153   (1)

Now, we will subtract the second equation from this modified first equation:
120z - 60p - (6z + 58p) = 153 - 165
114z - 118p = -12

Solving for z, we get:
114z = 118p - 12
z = (118p - 12) / 114
z = (59p - 6) / 57

Now, we substitute this expression for z back into the first equation:
40*((59p - 6) / 57) - 20p = 51
(40*59p - 40*6 - 20*57p) / 57 = 51
(2360p - 240 - 1140p) / 57 = 51
1220p - 240 = 57*51
1220p = 2897
p = 2897 / 1220
p = 2.375

Now, we substitute p back into the expression we found for z:
z = (59*2.375 - 6) / 57
z = (140.125 - 6) / 57
z = 134.125 / 57

Multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 71, we get:

3*(71s) - 3*(89f) = 3*5
71*(3f) + 71*(10s) = 71*93

This simplifies to:
213s - 267f = 15
213f + 710s = 6603

Now, let's multiply the first equation by 213 and the second equation by 267:

213*(213s) - 213*(267f) = 213*15
267*(213f) + 267*(710s) = 267*6603

This simplifies to:

71*7.52 - 89f = 5
533.92 - 89f = 5
-89f = 5 - 533.92
-89f = -528.92
f = -528.92 / -89
f = 5.94

Therefore, the values of s and f are s = 7.52 and f = 5.94.
### Answer: s = 7.52, f = 5.94.</pre>
