        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let the number of revolutions per minute on a windy day be x.
On a breezeless day, the wind turbine rotates at half the speed, so it rotates at x/2 revolutions per minute.
Given that on a breezeless day, the wind turbine rotates at 3 revolutions per minute, we have x/2 = 3.
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 6.
Therefore, the wind turbine makes 6 revolutions per minute on a windy day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let \( x \) be the number of children playing the game.
The total number of beach ball throws is \( 7x \).
Given that the total number of beach ball throws is 21, we have the equation:
\[ 7x = 21 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{21}{7} = 3 \]
There are 3 children playing the game.
