        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let \( x \) be the number of trees they need to plant to reach their goal of 17 trees in the forest. Initially, there were 18 trees, then 10 trees were cut down, so there were \( 18 - 10 = 8 \) trees left. After planting \( x \) trees, the total number of trees will be \( 8 + x \). This total should be 17 trees, so we have the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 17 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 17 - 8 = 9 \]

Therefore, they need to plant 9 trees to reach their goal of 17 trees in the forest.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">If Max initially had 11 gold coins, the total number of coins after finding the additional coins would be 11 + x, where x is the number of coins he found.
Since the total number of coins after finding the additional coins is 9 more than the initial 11 coins, we have the equation 11 + x = 11 + 9.
