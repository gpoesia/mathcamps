    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let the length of each side of the triangle be x cm.
Since all sides are equal, the perimeter is given by 3x = 195.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 195/3 = 65.
Therefore, each side of the triangle is 65 cm long.

        A triangle has a perimeter of 919m. You know that one of its sides is 350m long and the other side is 154m long. What is the length of the third side?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let the length of the third side be \( x \) meters.

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. Therefore, we have:

350m + 154m + x = 919m

Combining like terms, we get:

504m + x = 919m

Subtracting 504m from both sides, we get:

x = 919m - 504m
x = 415m

Therefore, the length of the third side is 415 meters.

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. Therefore, we have the equation:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let the length of the third side be \( x \) meters.  
The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides, so we have:  
\( 382 + 151 + x = 661 \)  
Solving for \( x \):  
\( x = 661 - 382 - 151 = 128 \)
