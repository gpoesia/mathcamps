f = 17/20 * 17/13 = 289/260.

Now, let's multiply f by 12/11:

f * 12/11 = (289/260) * (12/11) = (289 * 12) / (260 * 11) = 3468 / 2860.

Now, we multiply this fraction by 14/14:

(65/12) * (14/14) = (65 * 14) / (12 * 14) = 910 / 168

910/168 can be simplified to 35/6 as a mixed number:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Continuing from the previous step, we have found that 5 * (14 / 10) = 7. Now, we need to multiply this result by 5/6.

To multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. So, (7 * 5) / (1 * 6) = 35 / 6.

            In our previous problem, we calculated the result of (2 / 20) * 14. Now, let's change 2/20 to 2/12 and keep the 14 constant. Recalculate the problem with this change in initial fraction -- what is the new result?
