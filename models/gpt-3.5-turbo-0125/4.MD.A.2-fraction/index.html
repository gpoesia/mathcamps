Steve spent a total of 4.75*8 = &lt;&lt;4.75*8=38&gt;&gt;38 dollars.
Steve received an extra 11 dollars, so he now has 38+11 = &lt;&lt;38+11=49&gt;&gt;49 dollars.
John spent the same amount as Steve, which is 38 dollars.
John found 25 dollars, so he now has 18-38+25 = &lt;&lt;18-38+25=5&gt;&gt;5 dollars.

One day, he had a speed of 4/22 miles per hour without the use of the energy drink. After consuming the energy drink, at what rate would he jog if he continued for 46/30 hours?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first calculate the increase in speed after drinking the energy drink:
Increase in speed = 50/49 miles per hour

John's speed without the energy drink = 4/22 miles per hour

John's speed after drinking the energy drink = (4/22) + (50/49) miles per hour

Now, let's calculate the total speed after drinking the energy drink for 46/30 hours:
Total speed = (4/22 + 50/49) * (46/30) miles per hour

Total speed = (198/1078 + 1100/1078) * 46/30

Total speed = 1298/1078 * 46/30

            <span class="response-field">GPT-3.5 Turbo:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add 21/36 gallons of gas to the tank, we need to simplify the fraction first. 21/36 simplifies to 7/12.
To add 26/42 gallons of gas to the tank, we need to simplify the fraction first. 26/42 simplifies to 13/21.
So, the total amount of gas in the tank is 9 + 7/12 + 13/21 gallons.
To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 84.
Converting 7/12 to have a denominator of 84, we get 49/84.
Converting 13/21 to have a denominator of 84, we get 52/84.
Adding the fractions, we get 49/84 + 52/84 = 101/84.
Therefore, the truck driver has 9 + 101/84 gallons of gas in his tank now.

To find out how far he can drive, we need to multiply the total gallons by the miles each gallon lasts: (9 101/84) * 35 miles/gallon.
First, convert the mixed number to an improper fraction: 9 101/84 = (9*84 + 101)/84 = 817/84.
Now, multiply the total gallons by the miles each gallon lasts: (817/84) * 35 = 28595/84 miles.
Therefore, the truck driver can continue to drive for 28595/84 miles with the total amount of gasoline he has in his tank.
### Answer: 28595/84 miles.</pre>

            In the previous problem, we calculated how much fuel the truck driver had after adding 21/36 gallons and 26/42 gallons to 9 original gallons. 

Suppose now we mistakenly thought that the second stop was dispensing fuel faster and he actually added 26/4 gallons instead of 26/42 gallons in the second stop. If he still had the original 9 gallons to start with and added the 21/36 gallons in the first stop as per the original scenario, how much fuel would the truck driver have now in his truck after making both stops?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the new scenario, the truck driver added 26/4 gallons of gas in the second stop.
26/4 simplifies to 6.5 gallons.
So, the total amount of gas in the tank after the second stop is 9 + 21/36 + 6.5 gallons.
Converting 21/36 to have a denominator of 36, we get 21/36 = 0.5833...
Therefore, the total amount of gas in the tank is 9 + 0.5833... + 6.5 = 16.0833...
Rounded to two decimal places, the truck driver has 16.08 gallons of gas in his tank now after making both stops.
### Answer: 16.08 gallons.</pre>

Maria has 13/3 - 32/15 euros left.
To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15 in this case.

13/3 = 65/15
32/15

Now we can subtract the fractions:

Distance moved for the first rock = (speed) * (time) = (25/22) * (20/50) = (25*20)/(22*50) = 500/1100 = 5/11 miles.

Total distance moved = (5/11) + (125/88) = (440/968) + (125/88) = (440*88 + 125*11)/(968*88) = (38720 + 1375)/85184 = 40095/85184 miles.

            John bought a drone that can fly 3 kilometers, but when it's carrying a delivery package, it can only fly 50 / 43 kilometers less. When the drone is attached with an additional booster, it can fly an additional 47 / 15 kilometers. How far can the drone fly with the package and the additional booster attached?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: When the drone is carrying the delivery package, it can fly 3 - 50/43 = 129/43 kilometers.
With the additional booster, the drone can fly 129/43 + 47/15 = (129*15 + 47*43) / (43*15) = (1935 + 2021) / 645 = 3956 / 645 kilometers.

Volume of wine = 33/48 ounces

Volume of water = 2/36 liters

Converting all volumes to a common unit, let's convert the volume of wine to liters:
33/48 ounces * (1 liter / 33.814 ounces) = 33/48 * 1/33.814 liters â‰ˆ 0.0307 liters

Adding the volumes of all liquids consumed:

In 42 days, John consumes 48 ounces of apple juice. So, in 1 day, he consumes 48/42 = 1.14285714286 ounces of apple juice.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total time John was on the move, we need to add the time he traveled by car, the time he traveled by bus, and the time he took a break.

John traveled for 1/31 + 30/12 = 1/31 + 30/12 = 1/31 + 30/12 = 12/372 + 930/372 = 942/372 hours.

Adding the time he took a break, we get 942/372 + 17/4 = 942/372 + 159/372 = 1101/372 hours.

\[ x - 23/21 = 46 \]

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Walter originally had \( \frac{989}{21} \) dollars. He spent \( \frac{23}{21} \) dollars on the pen. To find out how much he spent on additional stationary items, we need to calculate the total amount spent on additional stationary items, which is the same as the amount spent on the pen, multiplied by the original amount of money Walter had.

Total amount spent on additional stationary items = \( \frac{23}{21} \times \frac{989}{21} \)

Total amount spent on additional stationary items = \( \frac{23 \times 989}{21 \times 21} \)

Total amount spent on additional stationary items = \( \frac{22847}{441} \)

Therefore, Walter spends \( \frac{22847}{441} \) dollars in total on the additional stationary items.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after loading all 39 containers, we first need to find the total tonnage of the cargo in the containers.

Each container carries 17/26 tons of cargo, so the total tonnage of cargo in all 39 containers is:
39 * (17/26) = 39 * 17 / 26 = 663 / 26 = 51/2 tons.

Adding this to the existing cargo load of 50/11 tons gives us the total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after loading all 39 containers:
51/2 + 50/11 = 55/2 + 50/11 = 275/22 + 100/22 = 375/22 = 375/22 tons.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of milk in the jug, we need to add the initial amount of milk to the additional amount of milk James added.

Initial amount of milk = 33/37 gallons
Additional amount of milk = 3/25 gallons

Total amount of milk = 33/37 + 3/25
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 925 in this case.

33/37 = (33*25)/(37*25) = 825/925
3/25 = (3*37)/(25*37) = 111/925

Now, adding the fractions:
825/925 + 111/925 = 936/925

42/25 = (42*37)/(25*37) = 1554/925

Now, adding the fractions:
825/925 + 1554/925 = 2379/925

Therefore, James has 2379/925 gallons of milk in total in the jug now.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total time spent on the journey and the break, we need to add the time taken for the journey and the break.

Time taken for the journey = 43/17 hours
Break time = 31/4 hours

Total time = 43/17 + 31/4
To add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 68.

43/17 = 43/17 * 4/4 = 172/68
31/4 = 31/4 * 17/17 = 527/68

Total time = 699/68 + 50
To add these two, we need to find a common denominator, which is 68.
