            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the barn is cubical, all sides are equal in length. Let's denote the length of each side as x. The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = x^3. Given that the volume of the barn is 1000 cubic meters, we have:

x^3 = 1000

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

x = 10

Therefore, the length of each side of the barn is 10 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Given that the volume of the cuboid is 64 kmÂ³ and all sides are of equal length, let's denote the length of each side as x km. The volume of a cuboid is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. Since all sides are equal, we have l = w = h = x.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the container is cube-shaped, the number of grapes it holds is equal to the volume of the cube. If one container holds 27 grapes, then the volume of the cube is 27. The volume of a cube is given by the formula side^3, where side is the length of each side of the cube. Therefore, side^3 = 27. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get side = 3.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Sure! The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of one side of the cube. Given that the volume of the container is 216 cubic meters, we have:

216 = s^3

To find the length of one side, we need to take the cube root of both sides:

s = âˆ›216
s = 6

Therefore, the length of one side of the cube container is 6 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula \( \text{Volume} = \text{Side Length}^3 \). Given that the volume of the cube is 729 cubic units, we have \( 729 = \text{Side Length}^3 \). Taking the cube root of both sides, we find \( \text{Side Length} = \sqrt[3]{729} = 9 \).

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the cookie dough is in the shape of a cube, the volume of the cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of each side of the cube. Given that the volume is 512 cubic cm, we have 512 = s^3. Taking the cube root of both sides, we find s = 8 cm.

            A guitarist uses a particular type of guitar string. The thickness of the string, in hundreds of a millimeter, cubed, will determine the pitch of a certain note, the guitarist wishes to play. If he needs the pitch to equal 343 Hz, what is the thickness of the string he should choose?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The guitarist needs to find the thickness of the string that will produce a pitch of 343 Hz. Since the pitch is determined by the thickness of the string cubed, we need to find the cube root of 343 to determine the thickness of the string.

Cube root of 343 = 7, because 7 * 7 * 7 = 343.

So, the guitarist should choose a string with a thickness of 7 hundredths of a millimeter.

            The cubic area of the compass box is 729 cubic cm. What is the length of one edge of this cubical compass box, given that it is a cube?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The length of one edge of the cube can be found by taking the cube root of the volume of the cube.
Let \( x \) be the length of one edge of the cube.
Given that the volume of the cube is 729 cubic cm, we have:
\[ x^3 = 729 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ x = \sqrt[3]{729} = 9 \]
Therefore, the length of one edge of the cube is 9 cm.

            A book is written with a unique style where every page is in the shape of a cube. If the volume of one page is 64 cubic inches, what is the side length of each page?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Given that the volume of one page is 64 cubic inches, and the volume of a cube is given by the formula \( \text{Volume} = \text{Side Length}^3 \), we can set up the equation \( 64 = \text{Side Length}^3 \) and solve for the side length.

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get \( \text{Side Length} = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \) inches.
