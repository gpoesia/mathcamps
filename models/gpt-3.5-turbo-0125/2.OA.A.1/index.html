            <span class="response-field">GPT-3.5 Turbo:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's denote the additional time John spends to finish the puzzle as 'b'. We know that John spends 7 hours initially and an additional 'b' hours to finish the puzzle, so the total time spent is 7 + b = 13 hours.
Solving the equation 7 + b = 13, we find b = 13 - 7 = 6.
Therefore, John spends an additional 6 hours to finish the puzzle.
