            Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?

            King Arthur is calculating the costs for restoring his castle. The wall repairs cost 26/22 of his castle's annual budget. Meanwhile, the moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget. Finally, installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget. How much (expressed as a fraction of the castle's annual budget) has King Arthur spent on these projects in total?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total fraction of the castle's annual budget spent on the projects, we add the fractions for each project: 26/22 + 4/29 + 11/3.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions: 22, 29, and 3 have a common multiple of 22*29*3 = 1914.

Converting each fraction to have a denominator of 1914:
26/22 = (26*87)/(22*87) = 2262/1914,
4/29 = (4*66)/(29*66) = 264/1914,
11/3 = (11*638)/(3*638) = 6998/1914.

Adding the fractions together: 2262/1914 + 264/1914 + 6998/1914 = 9524/1914.

Therefore, King Arthur has spent 9524/1914 of his castle's annual budget on these projects in total.

            Two planes depart from an airport at the exact same time. Plane A is flying at a speed of 24/11 miles per minute and Plane B is flying at a speed of 26/27 miles per minute. How much farther (in miles) did Plane A travel than Plane B after exactly one minute, assuming they keep flying at a stable speed?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the distance each plane traveled in one minute, we multiply their speeds by 1 minute:

Plane A: 24/11 miles/minute * 1 minute = 24/11 miles
Plane B: 26/27 miles/minute * 1 minute = 26/27 miles

To find the difference in distance traveled by Plane A and Plane B, we subtract the distance traveled by Plane B from the distance traveled by Plane A:

(24/11) - (26/27) = (24/11) - (26/27)
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 11*27 = 297:

(24/11) - (26/27) = (24/11)*(27/27) - (26/27)*(11/11)

12/8 + 12/3 = (12/8)*(3/3) + (12/3)*(8/8) = 36/24 + 96/24 = 132/24

            A compass maker is creating some specialty compasses. 

The compass needle is made from a special material. It takes 27/26 of a pound to create one needle. 

If the maker is trying to produce two identical needles, how much material will he require? 

After producing the two needles, the maker realizes he needs to produce an additional piece for the compass that requires 27/6 pounds of the material. 

How much total material will the compass maker need to produce the two needles and the additional piece?

            In addition to the colored pencils Marta uses for her art projects, she also has a pack of special metallic colored pencils. She uses 8 of these special pencils every 6 days. Adding these two amounts together, how many colored pencils in total does Marta use over an 11-day period? 

To find this, you need to add the fraction of colored pencils she uses from the previous problem to the amount of metallic pencils she uses. Evaluate this by performing the operation (8 / 6) + ((20 / 11) * (23 / 26)) and write your answer as a simplified fraction.

            A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspectâ€™s involvement. Calculate the value of f.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first calculate the value of indicator i:
For the first specimen, the decrease is 26 out of every 6 units, so the ratio of decrease is 26/6 = 13/3.
For the second specimen, the decrease is 25 out of every 17 units, so the ratio of decrease is 25/17.
Therefore, the ratio of changes (indicator i) is (13/3) / (25/17) = (13/3) * (17/25) = 221/75.

Now, let's calculate the value of indicator h:
For the first specimen, the increase is 18 out of every 8 units, so the ratio of increase is 18/8 = 9/4.
For the second specimen, the increase is 17 out of every 23 units, so the ratio of increase is 17/23.
Therefore, the difference between these two rates (indicator h) is (9/4) - (17/23) = (207/92) - (68/92) = 139/92.

Finally, let's calculate the final evidence factor (indicator f) by multiplying indicators h and i:
Indicator f = (221/75) * (139/92) = 30659/6900.

            Sonia uses 21/12 oz of toothpaste to brush her teeth every day. Her brother Anthony uses less toothpaste, just 6/27 oz daily. Add both quantities of toothpaste to get the total daily amount used by Sonia and Anthony.

Now, suppose their mom includes an amount of toothpaste for herself to the total - she uses 3/18 oz of toothpaste daily. Add this amount to the total used by Sonia and Anthony to get the final total daily toothpaste usage for the whole family. Solve each fraction separately and give the answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total daily amount of toothpaste used by Sonia and Anthony, we add their individual amounts:

Sonia: 21/12 oz
Anthony: 6/27 oz

First, we need to find a common denominator for 12 and 27, which is 108.

Converting 21/12 to have a denominator of 108:
21/12 = 63/36 = 63/36 * 3/3 = 189/108

Converting 6/27 to have a denominator of 108:
6/27 = 24/108

Adding the amounts used by Sonia and Anthony:
189/108 + 24/108 = 213/108

Now, we add the amount used by their mom, which is 3/18 oz. Converting 3/18 to have a denominator of 108:
3/18 = 18/108

Adding the total amount used by the whole family:
213/108 + 18/108 = 231/108

Now, we need to add grandma's daily toothpaste usage of 24/28 oz to the total.

Converting 24/28 to have a denominator of 108:
24/28 = 72/84 = 72/84 * 3/3 = 216/252

Adding grandma's toothpaste usage to the total:
231/108 + 216/252

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 252.

Converting 231/108 to have a denominator of 252:
231/108 = 693/324

Adding the total daily toothpaste usage for the whole family:
693/324 + 216/252 = 231/108 + 216/252 = 693/324 + 216/252 = 909/324

            Let's suppose for a special recipe sandwich, you need to divide a wheel of cheese into 14 equal parts and a pickle jar into 18 equal parts. 

To make one special sandwich, you need 21 parts of the wheel of cheese and 7 parts from the pickle jar.

You've just made these sandwiches and you are down to ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of your original ingredients.

Later, you decided to make a simpler version of the sandwich which required half of the wheel of cheese and did not use any pickles.

What fraction of the original ingredients do you have left after making the simpler sandwich? Calculate the answer by subtracting (2 / 4) from the fraction you had after making the first sandwich.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of mayonnaise and sandwich spread Shawn uses to make one sandwich, we add the amounts together:

23/28 + 6/9 = 207/252 + 168/252 = 375/252 = 125/84 cups

Now, when Shawn adds 18/12 cups of cheese spread to the recipe, the total amount of ingredients needed for one sandwich becomes:

125/84 + 18/12 = 125/84 + 168/84 = 293/84 cups

To make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, we multiply the amount needed for one sandwich by the number of sandwiches:

293/84 * 4 = 1172/84 = 293/21 cups

            In a beehive, there are sections for honey storage and bee rearing. Each section is classified into many sub-sections. One day, the beekeeper discovered that each honey storage sub-section had (25 / 9) gallons of honey. He also found the same amount of honey in each bee rearing sub-section. 

If he combined the honey from both a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the beekeeper would have a total quantity represented by 'p'. 

However, one honey storage sub-section had an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey. So, if the beekeeper was calculating the total amount from this sub-section plus a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be defined as 's'. 

What quantity of honey ('s') would the beekeeper have in total from this scenario?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first calculate the amount of honey in each bee rearing sub-section:
Each bee rearing sub-section has 25/9 gallons of honey.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of honey when combining a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section:
Total amount = (25/9) + (25/9) = 50/9 gallons

Next, let's calculate the total amount of honey in the specific honey storage sub-section with an additional (2/26) gallons of honey:
Total amount = (25/9) + (2/26) = (25/9) + (1/13) = (325/117) + (9/117) = 334/117 gallons

Therefore, the quantity of honey 's' that the beekeeper would have in total from this scenario is 334/117 gallons.

28/6 + 21/18 + 24/22

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 6, 18, and 22 is 66.

Rewriting the fractions with the common denominator of 66:

(28/6) * (11/11) = 308/66

(21/18) * (3/3) = 63/66

24/22 = 72/66

Adding the fractions together:

The total amount of sugar she used before increasing it is 11/17 + 3 = 11/17 + 51/17 = 62/17 cups.

To increase the total quantity of sugar by a factor of 29/21, we multiply the total amount of sugar by 29/21:

So, Carlos would need an additional 28/5 units of wood to make one special chair. Adding this to the usual 20/15 units of wood needed for a chair:

20/15 + 28/5 = 4/3 + 28/5 = (4*5 + 28*3) / (3*5) = (20 + 84) / 15 = 104 / 15

Instead of using 20/15 units of wood as he was previously, he can now use only 20/8 units for the basic chair design. The larger design with the special feature still requires (24/5) times (7/6) units more wood than the basic chair.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how much less of the zebra the lion ate compared with the wildebeest, we need to find the difference between the fractions of the zebra and the wildebeest that the lion ate.

The lion ate 28/26 - 23/9 of the zebra and the wildebeest, respectively.

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is the least common multiple of 26 and 9, which is 26*9 = 234.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 234:
28/26 = (28*9)/(26*9) = 252/234
23/9 = (23*26)/(9*26) = 598/234

Now, we can subtract the fractions:
252/234 - 598/234 = (252-598)/234 = -346/234

Simplifying the fraction:

            In the jungle, a lion ate 28/26 of a zebra in one day and 23/9 of a wildebeest the next day. The lion realized it was still hungry, so it ate 21/4 as much as the difference between the wildebeest and the zebra the next day. How much did the lion eat the next day? Please express your answer as a simplified fraction.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first find the difference between the amount the lion ate from the wildebeest and the zebra:
Amount from wildebeest = 23/9
Amount from zebra = 28/26 = 14/13
Difference = 23/9 - 14/13

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is the least common multiple of 9 and 13, which is 9*13 = 117.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 117:
23/9 = (23*13)/(9*13) = 299/117
14/13 = (14*9)/(13*9) = 126/117

Now, we can subtract the fractions:
299/117 - 126/117 = (299-126)/117 = 173/117

Now, the lion ate 21/4 times this difference:
21/4 * 173/117 = 21*173 / 4*117 = 3633/468 = 1211/156

Therefore, the lion ate 1211/156 of the difference between the wildebeest and the zebra the next day.

(207/126) * (18/17) = (207*18) / (126*17) = 3726 / 2142 = 1863 / 1071 = 31 / 18

Therefore, the total distance covered by all three snails in 1 hour is 31/18 meters.

Next, we find the difference between the original fabric and the remaining fabric: 24/14 - 15/11 = 24/14 - 20/14 = 4/14 = 2/7 yards.
Finally, we calculate the amount of new fabric Johnny used: 15/2 * 2/7 = 15/7 = 2 1/7 yards.

            Turtle Tilly is collecting food for the winter. She has gathered 25/9 kg of sea plants, and she then finds 8/13 kg more. In a close-by rock, she spots another food stash weighing 24/27 kg. After gobbling up these finds, Tilly stumbles upon yet another food source weighing 21/26 kg. If Tilly combines all her found food, how many kilograms does she now have in total? Answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total weight of food Tilly has, we need to add up all the amounts she found:
25/9 + 8/13 + 24/27 + 21/26

First, we need to find a common denominator for all the fractions. The least common multiple of 9, 13, 27, and 26 is 702.

Rewriting the fractions with the common denominator:
(25*78)/(9*78) + (8*54)/(13*54) + (24*26)/(27*26) + (21*27)/(26*27)
= 175/702 + 104/702 + 624/702 + 567/702
= (175 + 104 + 624 + 567)/702
= 1470/702

Now, we simplify the fraction:
1470/702 = 735/351 = 245/117

Therefore, Turtle Tilly now has a total of 245/117 kg of food.

            Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements.

            A lamp store owner is doing inventory of all the lamps in his store. He found that he has 4/26 of lamps that are floor lamps, 15/11 that are desk lamps, he also discovered he has 23/28 of table lamps and finally 8/19 of lamps that are decorative. What fraction of his total inventory do these lamps constitute?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total fraction of lamps in the store, we add the fractions of each type of lamp:
4/26 + 15/11 + 23/28 + 8/19

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 26, 11, 28, and 19 is 26*11*28*19 = 13924.

Converting each fraction to have a denominator of 13924:
4/26 = (4*537) / (26*537) = 2148/13924
15/11 = (15*1268) / (11*1268) = 19020/13924
23/28 = (23*497) / (28*497) = 11431/13924
8/19 = (8*732) / (19*732) = 5856/13924

Adding these fractions together:
2148/13924 + 19020/13924 + 11431/13924 + 5856/13924 = 38455/13924

Therefore, these lamps constitute 38455/13924 of the total inventory.

            In a snow fight, Mike threw 9/19 of his snowballs and his friend, John threw 6/8 of his snowballs. After a while, Mike found 4 more snowballs to throw.

The question is, if 'u' represents the number of snowballs thrown by both Mike and John and 'j' is the total number of snowballs Mike had after finding more, how many snowballs did Mike have in total?

Solve the following equations to find the variable 'j':

u = 9/19 + 6/8

j = u + 4/1

            Debra is baking cookies and she realizes she has two different recipes for the same type of cookie. She's wondering if she combines the ingredients from both, if she will end up with even more cookies or not. 

The first recipe requires (27 / 3) cups flour and (11 / 7) cups sugar. She determines the ratio of flour to sugar by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar. She then subtracts (21 / 26) from this ratio because that's how many cups of sugar her friend says makes the cookies too sweet. After that, she adds (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio to see how many total cups of flour she will need. How many cups of flour will she have in the end?

Next, let's calculate the ratio of flour to sugar:
- Ratio = 9 / 1.57 â‰ˆ 5.73

Now, let's subtract the amount of sugar her friend says makes the cookies too sweet:
- New ratio = 5.73 - 21 / 26 â‰ˆ 5.73 - 0.81 â‰ˆ 4.92

Now, let's add the additional flour from the second recipe:
- Total flour needed = 9 + 22 / 9 â‰ˆ 9 + 2.44 â‰ˆ 11.44 cups

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 27 and 26 is 27*26 = 702.

Converting the fractions to have a common denominator of 702:
(24/27) * (26/26) = 624/702
(30/26) * (27/27) = 810/702

Adding the fractions:
(624/702) + (810/702) = (624 + 810) / 702 = 1434 / 702

Professor Astro finds that ((24 / 27) + (30 / 26)) = 1434 / 702.

            Upon recalculating his telescope's potential with more accurate data, Professor Astro realizes that the light gathering power of his lens is actually 12 out of 27, not 24 out of 27 as previously calculated. Professor Astro recalculates the sum of these two fractions ((12 / 27) + (30 / 26)). What is the resulting sum now?

            Jaden is a dairy farmer who milks his cows twice a day. In the morning, his cows give him 26/14 gallons of milk per cow, and in the evening, they give 28/20 gallons of milk per cow. If he multiplies these two fractions together, how much milk is he getting from one cow in one day?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To multiply the fractions, we first convert them to a common denominator. We have 26/14 = 13/7 and 28/20 = 7/5. Multiplying these fractions gives us (13/7) * (7/5) = (13*7) / (7*5) = 91 / 35 gallons of milk per cow in one day.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Following the previous problem, let's consider that Jaden has made some changes on his farm that affected the milk production in the evening. Now, his cows give him 28/10 gallons of milk per cow in the evening instead of the previous 28/20 gallons. If we still take the morning milk production as 26/14 gallons per cow, how much milk is he getting from one cow in one day now?
        </p>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The morning milk production remains the same at 26/14 = 13/7 gallons per cow. The evening milk production is now 28/10 = 14/5 gallons per cow. Multiplying these fractions gives us (13/7) * (14/5) = (13*14) / (7*5) = 182 / 35 gallons of milk per cow in one day.
