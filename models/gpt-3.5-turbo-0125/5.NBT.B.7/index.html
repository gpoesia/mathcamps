    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

Therefore, the manufacturer can now produce 28 of the new sleeping bags with the available material.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Given that each kilogram of oranges produces 43.8 liters of juice, we can find the total amount of juice produced from 4.8 kilograms of oranges by multiplying the amount of juice produced by each kilogram by the total number of kilograms:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: If there were originally 81 acres of land, and 31.94 acres are used for growing corn, then the number of acres left unused would be 81 - 31.94 = &lt;&lt;81-31.94=49.06&gt;&gt;49.06 acres.
