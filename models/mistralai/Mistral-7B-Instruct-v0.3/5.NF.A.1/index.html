            John has been learning to add and subtract fractions at school. He was given a problem during his homework that puzzled him. He had to take the sum of 48/56 and 95/23 and then subtract 34/26 from the result. What was the value that John found for this operation? Answer in simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we add the fractions 48/56 and 95/23 by finding a common denominator, which is 117. Then, we add the numerators and keep the denominator the same: (48/56 + 95/23) = (48*23/117 + 95*56/117) = (1063/117).
Next, we subtract 34/26 from the result: (1063/117 - 34/26) = (1063*26 - 34*117)/(117*26) = (27518 - 4091)/2962 = 23427/2962.
Finally, we simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator, which is 29: 23427/2962 = (23427/29) * (1/98) = 801/98.

            First, add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65. Then subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result. What is the result expressed as a simple fraction?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions, find a common denominator, which is 189 (the least common multiple of 9 and 65).

For 88/9, multiply the numerator and denominator by 21 (since 21*9 = 189 and 21 is the smallest number that can be multiplied by 9 to get 189): 88*21/9*21 = 1832/189.

For 28/65, multiply the numerator and denominator by 3 (since 3*65 = 195 and 3 is the smallest number that can be multiplied by 65 to get 195): 28*3/65*3 = 84/195.

Now, add the fractions: (1832/189) + (84/195) = (1832+84)/189*195 = 1916/1890.

To simplify the fraction, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator: GCD(1916, 1890) = 84.

Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD: 1916/84 / 1890/84 = 23/23.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To simplify the fractions, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerators and denominators, and adjust the fractions accordingly.

For the first fraction, the GCD of 63 and 41 is 7. So, we adjust the fraction to (63/41) = (9*7)/(41*1) = 9/41.

For the second fraction, the GCD of 44 and 50 is 4. So, we adjust the fraction to (44/50) = (11*4)/(50*1) = 11/50.

Now, we add the simplified fractions: (9/41) + (11/50) = (9+11)/(41*50) = 20/2050.

To simplify the fraction further, we find the GCD of 20 and 2050. The GCD of 20 and 2050 is 20. So, we adjust the fraction to 20/2050 = 1/102.5.

However, since we cannot have a fraction with a denominator that is not a whole number, we cannot simplify the expression any further.

### Answer: The result cannot be simplified any further. The simplified expression is (9/41) + (11/50) = 1/102.5.</pre>

Multiplying 88 by 1 gives 88, and multiplying 38 by 1 gives 38.

Now, we can write 88 as 88*(53/53) and 38 as 38*(1/53).

Adding these two fractions gives:

88*(53/53) + 38*(1/53) = (88*53 + 38) / 53 = 4688/53

Now, we convert each fraction to have the same denominator (396) by multiplying the first fraction by 4/4 and the second fraction by 6/6.

((80/94) * (4/4)) + ((78/59) * (6/6)) = (320/396) + (474/396)

Now, we add the fractions:

(320+474)/396 = 794/396

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator. The GCF of 794 and 396 is 1.

82/9 and 82/63 are equivalent to 820/900 and 82/630, respectively.
To subtract the second fraction from the first, we need to find a common denominator, which is 900.
So, we need to find a multiple of 630 that is also a multiple of 900. The least common multiple of 630 and 900 is 1890.
Now, we can rewrite the second fraction as (82/630)*(1890/1890) = 1890/9000.
Now, we can subtract the second fraction from the first: (820/900) - (1890/9000) = (820-1890)/9000 = -1070/9000.
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10: (1070/10)/(9000/10) = 107/900.

Now, subtract the sum of 320/364 and 156/144 from 1044/3:
(1044/3) - ((320+156)/144) = (1044-476)/3 = 568/3

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To simplify the fractions, we find the common multiple of their denominators (18 and 60) which is 180. We then adjust the numerators accordingly.

For 37/18, the new numerator is 37*10 = &lt;&lt;37*10=370&gt;&gt;370.
For 24/60, the new numerator is 24*10 = &lt;&lt;24*10=240&gt;&gt;240.

Now, we have 370/180 + 240/180 = &lt;&lt;370/180+240/180=610/180&gt;&gt;610/180.

To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator, which is 180. We then divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.

610/180 Ã· 180/180 = &lt;&lt;610/180 Ã· 180/180=3.4444444444444446&gt;&gt;3.4444444444444446.

However, since we are dealing with fractions, the final answer should be in the form of a fraction. So, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to get a more common denominator.

3.4444444444444446 * 100 = &lt;&lt;3.4444444444444446*100=344.44444444444446&gt;&gt;344.44444444444446
344.44444444444446 / 100 = &lt;&lt;344.44444444444446/100=3.4444444444444446&gt;&gt;3.4444444444444446

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To add fractions, we need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 41 and 62 is 209. So, we will find the multiples of 41 and 62 that are less than 209, and then find the lowest common multiple.

Multiples of 41: 41, 82, 123, 164, 205
Multiples of 62: 62, 124, 186

The lowest common multiple is 209.

Now, we will convert each fraction to have the denominator 209.

For 33/41, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5: (33*5)/(41*5) = 165/209

For 95/62, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3: (95*3)/(62*3) = 285/186

Now, we will find the least common multiple of the new denominators, which is 209. We will convert 186 to 209 by multiplying by 1.153846154 (209/186).

285*1.153846154 = 328.472365

Since we cannot have a fractional number of clips, we will round down to the nearest whole number, which is 328.

Now, we will convert 165 and 328 to have the same denominator, which is 209.

165/209 * (209/209) = 165/209
328/209 * (209/1) = 328/1

Now, we will add the fractions: (165/209) + (328/1) = (165+328)/1 = 493/1

Since the fraction 493/1 is already simplified, we will leave it as it is.

((30 * 38 / 11 * 38) + (72 * 11 / 38 * 38)) / (38 * 38)

Simplifying the expression:

((1100 + 792) / 1444)

Now, add the second expression:

((1100 + 792) / 1444) + (81 / 34)

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. Let's use 1444. Multiply the second fraction by 4 to get a common denominator:

((1100 + 792) / 1444) + (324 / 1444)

Now, add the numerators:

(64 / 34) as a fraction with a denominator of 126 is (64 * 3 / 34 * 3) = (192 / 102).
(3 / 24) as a fraction with a denominator of 126 is (3 * 5 / 24 * 6) = (15 / 144).

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, Daniel adds 83/73 and 53/77. To add fractions with different denominators, he needs to find a common multiple of the two denominators. The least common multiple (LCM) of 73 and 77 is 531. He then converts both fractions to have 531 as their denominator.

For 83/73, he multiplies both the numerator and denominator by 7 to get 581/531.
For 53/77, he multiplies both the numerator and denominator by 7 to get 371/531.

Now, he adds the two fractions: 581/531 + 371/531 = 952/531.

Next, Daniel adds 80/76 to the result 'w'. To do this, he first converts 80 to a fraction with 531 as the denominator by multiplying it by 7 (581). This gives him 3666/531.

Finally, he adds the two fractions: 952/531 + 3666/531 = 4618/531.

However, the final answer should be in simplified form. To simplify the fraction, he finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator and divides both by the GCD. The GCD of 4618 and 531 is 13.

So, the final answer is 4618/531 simplified to 354/41.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add fractions, the denominators must be the same. We can find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 20 and 66, which is 132. Then, we can convert each fraction to have the common denominator 132.

For 27/20, we multiply the fraction by 6.6 (which is the ratio of 132 to 20) to get 162/132.

For 14/66, we multiply the fraction by 1 (which is the ratio of 132 to 66) to get 14/132.

Now, we can add the fractions: 162/132 + 14/132 = (162+14)/132 = 176/132.

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, which is 16. We divide both the numerator and denominator by 16: 176/132 Ã· 16 = 11/8.

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator. The GCD of 154 and 60 is 2. We divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD: 154/60 = (154/2)/(60/2) = 77/30.

            Suppose you have the following three fractions: 82/49, 45/60, and 99/59. 

If you add the first fraction (82/49) with the second one (45/60), call this result 'd'. Then, add 'd' to the third fraction (99/59). 

What would be the resulting sum? Please provide your answer as a simplified fraction.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, let's find the sum of the first two fractions (82/49 + 45/60). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 49 and 60 is 180. So, we'll convert both fractions to have 180 as their denominator:

(82/49) * (3/6) + (45/60) * (3/5) = (246/180) + (135/180) = (381/180)

Now, we'll add this result to the third fraction (99/59). To do this, we'll convert the third fraction to have 180 as its denominator:

(99/59) * (3/3) = (297/177)

Now, we'll add the two fractions:

(381/180) + (297/177) = (381*177 + 297*180)/(180*177) = (67837/32660)

To simplify this fraction, we'll find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator:

GCD(67837, 32660) = 303

Now, we'll divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

(67837/303) / (32660/303) = (223) / (108)

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning for step 1: To subtract 76/30 from 91/16, we first find a common denominator, which is 48. So, we multiply the numerator and denominator of 91/16 by 3 and the numerator and denominator of 76/30 by 2 to get 273/48 and 152/48 respectively. Then, we subtract 152/48 from 273/48 to get 121/48.

Reasoning for step 2: To add the result from step 1 to 18/44, we first find a common denominator, which is 168. So, we multiply the numerator and denominator of 121/48 by 3 and the numerator and denominator of 18/44 by 4 to get 363/168 and 72/168 respectively. Then, we add 363/168 and 72/168 to get 435/168.

To round the final answer to the nearest hundredth, we divide the numerator by the denominator and round the result to the nearest hundredth.

435/168 = 2.5833333333333335

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get 2.58.

Now, we subtract the second fraction from the first:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of two fractions with different denominators, we first find a common multiple of the denominators. The least common multiple (LCM) of 35 and 85 is 290. We can multiply both the numerator and denominator of each fraction by a number that makes the denominator equal to the LCM.

For 86/35, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 8 to get 688/280.
For 68/85, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 3 to get 204/255.

Now, we can add the fractions: 688/280 + 204/255.

To find a common denominator, we can multiply the least common multiple of the denominators (290) by 1 (which doesn't change the value of the fraction). So, we multiply 280 by 1 and 255 by 1.12 (which is the ratio of the LCM to 280).

688/280 * (290/290) + 204/255 * (290/255 * 1.12) = 688*290/280*290 + 204*290/255*1.12

Simplifying the fractions:
688*290/280*290 = 200,720
204*290/255*1.12 = 300

Now, we add the numerators: 200,720 + 300 = 201,020

Finally, we write the sum as a simplified fraction: 201,020/290

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To add fractions with different denominators, we first find a common multiple of the denominators. The least common multiple (LCM) of 53 and 94 is 474. We can find the LCM by multiplying the prime factors of both numbers and selecting the highest power of each prime factor.

For 53: 5^1 * 7^1 = 35
For 94: 2^2 * 7^1 * 13^1 = 274

The LCM is 474 = 2^2 * 5^1 * 7^1 * 13^1

Now, we convert each fraction to have the same denominator by multiplying each fraction by a number such that the denominator becomes the LCM.

For 99/53: (99/53) * (474/474) = (99 * 474)/(53 * 474) = 46361/2362

For 67/94: (67/94) * (474/474) = (67 * 474)/(94 * 474) = 31882/4488

Now, we can add the fractions:

(46361/2362) + (31882/4488) = (46361 + 31882)/(2362 * 4488/4488) = (78243/2362)

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator and divide both by the GCD.

GCD(78243, 2362) = 11

So, the simplified fraction is (78243/2362) / (11/11) = 78243/2362

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 27 and 33 is 81. We can express 74/27 as (74*3)/(27*3) = 222/81 and 56/33 as (56*2)/(33*2) = 112/66. Now, we can subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same: (222-112)/81 = 110/81.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, find the sum of 96/40 and 11/99.
(96/40 + 11/99) = (3*96 + 11)/(40*99) = (387 + 11)/4000 = 398/4000
Now, subtract 91/65 from 398/4000.
(398/4000 - 91/65) = (398*65 - 91*4000)/(4000*65) = (24830 - 364000)/260000 = -119567/260000
Since the result is negative, we can simplify the fraction by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by -1.
(-1)*(-119567/260000) = 119567/260000

90/81 = (9*3)/(81*3) = 9/243
2/66 = (2*1)/(66*1) = 2/66

Now, we can add the fractions:
(9/243) + (2/66) = (9+2)/(243*66) = 11/15746

To simplify the fraction, we can factor the numerator:
11 = 1*11

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To find the sum of the two fractions, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 75 and 92 is 360.

Now, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

92/75 becomes (92*4)/(75*4) = 368/300
66/92 becomes (66*4)/(92*4) = 264/368

Now, we can add the fractions:

(368/300) + (264/368) = (368+264)/368 = 632/368

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common factor of the numerator and the denominator:

The greatest common factor of 632 and 368 is 16.

So, the simplified fraction is 632/368 simplified to 39/22.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, find the common denominator for the fractions, which is 99. Convert the fractions to have the common denominator:

(80/90) * (11/11) + (52/11) * (9/9) = (880/990) + (468/990)

Now, add the fractions:

(1348/990) = 1 4/990

Since the fraction 4/990 is not a common fraction, we can simplify it by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

(1348/990) = (1348/990) * (1/4) = (337/247.5)

However, since we are looking for a mixed number, we need to convert the improper fraction to a mixed number. To do this, we find the whole number part of the fraction by dividing the numerator by the denominator:

337 Ã· 247 = 1

So, the mixed number is 1 337/247.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To find the sum of two fractions with different denominators, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 74 is 252.

Now, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator 252:

For 12/18, multiply the numerator and denominator by 14 (which is the LCM of 1 and 14, the multiples of 18 and 252 divided by 18):
12 * 14 / 18 * 14 = 168 / 252

For 91/74, multiply the numerator and denominator by 3 (which is the LCM of 74 and 252 divided by 74):
91 * 3 / 74 * 3 = 273 / 252

Now, add the fractions:
168/252 + 273/252 = (168+273)/252 = 441/252

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator:
GCF(441, 252) = 9

Now, divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF:
441/252 = (441/9) / (252/9) = 49/28

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To add fractions, we need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 72 is 144. So, we find the equivalent fractions of 29/20 and 17/72 with a denominator of 144.

For 29/20, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 7:
(29*7)/(20*7) = 203/140

For 17/72, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 12:
(17*12)/(72*12) = 204/864

Now, we can add the fractions:
203/140 + 204/864 = (203+204)/(140*864) = 407/1140

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator:
GCD(407, 1140) = 1

So, the simplified fraction is 407/1140.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we simplify the fractions by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerators and denominators, and then dividing both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

GCD(36, 27) = 9, so 36/27 simplifies to 4/3.
GCD(80, 10) = 10, so 80/10 simplifies to 8.
GCD(73, 79) = 1, so 73/79 remains unchanged.

Now we can add the simplified fractions: (4/3 + 8) - (73/79).

Adding the fractions: (4+24)/3 - 73/79.

Combining the numerators: (28)/3 - 73/79.

To find a common denominator, we can multiply the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 79 by both denominators: LCM(3, 79) = 237.

Now we find the multiples of 237 that are multiples of both 3 and 79: 237, 474, 711, 948, 1185, 1422, 1659, 1896, 2133, 2370, 2607, 2844, 3081, 3318, 3555, 3792, 4029, 4266, 4503, 4739, 4975, 5211, 5447, 5683, 5919, 6155, 6391, 6627, 6863, 7100, 7337, 7573, 7809, 8045, 8281, 8517, 8753, 8989, 9225, 9461, 9697, 9933, 10169, 10395, 10621, 10847, 11073, 11300, 11527, 11753, 11979, 12205, 12431, 12657, 12883, 13109, 13335, 13561, 13787, 14013, 14239, 14465, 14691, 14917, 15143, 15369, 15595, 15821, 16047, 16273, 16499, 16725, 16951, 17177, 17393, 17610, 17827, 18043, 18259, 18475, 18691, 18907, 19123, 19339, 19555, 19771, 19987, 20203, 20419, 20635, 20851, 21067, 21283, 21499, 21715, 21931, 22147, 22363, 22579, 22795, 23011, 23227, 23443, 23659, 23875, 24091, 24307, 24523, 24739, 249</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add fractions with different denominators, we first find a common multiple of the denominators. The least common multiple (LCM) of 71 and 75 is 315. We convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCM as the denominator.

(86 / 71) * (315 / 315) + (91 / 75) * (315 / 315)

(86 * 315) / (71 * 315) + (91 * 315) / (75 * 315)

(27,690) / 2235 + (28,180) / 2475

Now, we can add the numerators and keep the common denominator:

(27,690 + 28,180) / 2235

55,870 / 2235

To find the decimal equivalent, we divide 55,870 by 2235:

55,870 / 2235 = 24.949494949495

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 75 and 43 is 315, and the least common multiple of 75 and 62 is 315. We can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 315.

For (21 / 75): (21 * 4) / (75 * 4) = 84 / 300
For (74 / 43): (74 * 7) / (43 * 7) = 538 / 301
For (10 / 62): (10 * 5) / (62 * 5) = 50 / 310

Now, we can add the fractions: (84 + 538 + 50) / 300 = 672 / 300

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common factor of the numerator and the denominator: The greatest common factor of 672 and 300 is 12.

So, the simplified fraction is 672 / 300 simplified to 672 / 12 * (300 / 300) = 56 / 25

Convert 75/66 to 75*9/66*61 = 630/66*61.
Convert 81/61 to 81*10/61*66 = 880/66*61.

Now, add the fractions: (630/66*61) + (880/66*61) = (630+880)/66 = 1510/66.

To reduce the fraction to its lowest terms, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator: GCD(1510, 66) = 2.

So, the fraction is reduced to 1510/66 / 2 = 755/33.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find the common denominator for the fractions 53/18 and 21/99. The least common multiple of 18 and 99 is 18*6*7 = 792.

Now, we convert both fractions to have this common denominator:

For 53/18, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 6*7 = 42: 53*42/18*42 = 2206/792

For 21/99, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 6: 21*6/99*6 = 126/594

Now, we add the two fractions: (2206/792) + (126/594)

To add the fractions, we need a common numerator. We can do this by multiplying the second fraction by 6/6: (2206/792) + (126*6/594*6) = (2206/792) + (756/594)

Now, we can add the numerators and write the sum over the common denominator: (2206+756)/594 = &lt;&lt;(2206+756)/594=2962/594&gt;&gt;2962/594

For 58/49: (58*3)/(49*3) = 174/147
For 31/34: (31*3)/(34*3) = 93/102

Now, add the fractions: (174+93)/147*102 = 267/147

Next, find the least common multiple (LCM) of the new denominator 147 and the numerator 267, which is 501. Convert the fraction to have the denominator 501.

(267*3)/(147*3) = 791/441

Now, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 1 (501) to get the fraction with the denominator 501.

791*501/441*501 = 395601/220501

Finally, simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 395601/220501 simplifies to 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  To find the value of 24/86 + 76/77, we first need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple of 86 and 77 is 611. So, we can rewrite the fractions as follows:

24/86 = (24 * 7/611)
76/77 = (76 * 1/77)

Now, we can add the fractions:

(24 * 7/611) + (76 * 1/77) = (168 * 7 + 76) / 611

Simplify the numerator:

168 * 7 + 76 = 1176 + 76 = 1252

Now, we have the sum of the fractions:

(1252 / 611)

To subtract this from 27/6, we first need to convert 27/6 to a fraction with denominator 611. To do this, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same number such that the denominator becomes 611:

27 * (103 / 103) = 2763 / 103

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

(1252 / 611) - (2763 / 103)

To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6110 (the least common multiple of 611 and 103). We can rewrite the fractions as follows:

(1252 * 10 / 6110) - (2763 * 6 / 6110)

Simplify the numerator:

12520 - 16578 = -4058

Now, we have the difference of the fractions:

(-4058 / 6110)

The least common multiple (LCM) of 39 and 14 is 138. We can then convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCM as the denominator.

For 73/39:
Equivalent fraction: (73*4)/(39*4) = 292/156

For 49/14:
Equivalent fraction: (49*10)/(14*10) = 490/140

Now, we can add the fractions:
Sum: (292+490)/156

Simplify the fraction:
Sum: 782/156

The fraction 782/156 is already in its simplest form, as it has no common factors other than 1 between the numerator and the denominator.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To simplify the fractions, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the denominators (65 and 39) and adjust both fractions so they have the same denominator. The GCD of 65 and 39 is 13.

Adjusting the first fraction: 75/65 * (39/39) = (75*39)/(65*39) = 2925/2465
Adjusting the second fraction: 7/39 * (65/65) = (7*65)/(39*65) = 455/2465

Now, adding the fractions: 2925/2465 + 455/2465 = (2925+455)/2465 = 3380/2465

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator (3380) and denominator (2465). The GCF of 3380 and 2465 is 1.

So, the simplified sum is 3380/2465.

Now, subtract the two fractions: (178/92) - (238/92) = (178 - 238)/92 = -60/92.

Next, find the common denominator of 61 and 63, which is 189. Then, convert 61 to 189/3 and 63 to 189/33.

Now, subtract the two fractions: (189/3) - (189/33) = (189 - 189*11/33) = (189*2/33) = 71/33.

Finally, subtract the second result from the first result: (-60/92) - (71/33) = (-60*33/92*33) - (71*92/33*92) = (-1980/3084) + (6392/3084) = (6392 - 1980)/3084 = 4412/3084.

For 43/86, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 7 to get 301/602.

Now, we can see that 736 and 301 are not multiples of each other, so we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 736 and 301, which is 1. We can then add the fractions by adding the numerators and keeping the common denominator.

(736 + 301)/104 = 1037/104

However, this fraction is already in its simplest form since the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.
### Answer: The sum of 92/13 and 43/86 as a simplified fraction is 1037/104.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To add fractions, we need to have the same denominator. To find a common denominator, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two denominators. The LCM of 32 and 98 is 304.

Now, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator 304:

67/32 = (67*9)/(32*9) = 609/288
10/98 = (10*30)/(98*30) = 300/2940

Now, we can add the fractions:

(609/288) + (300/2940) = (609+300)/288*30 = 909/864

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 9:

909/864 = (909/9) * (864/9) = 101 * 93 = &lt;&lt;101*93=9333&gt;&gt;9333/9

### Answer: 9333/9

To express this as a simplified fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:

9333/9 = (9333/3) * (3/3) = 3111 * 1 = &lt;&lt;3111&gt;&gt;3111/1

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To find the sum of the two fractions, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 52 and 32 is 160.

Now, we can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:

59/52 = (59*4)/(52*4) = 236/208
70/32 = (70*5)/(32*5) = 350/160

Now, we can add the fractions:

(236/208) + (350/160) = (236+350)/160 = 586/160

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator:

GCF(586, 160) = 84

Now, we divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF:

586/160 = (586/84)*(84/160) = 7*7/10*7/10 = 49/10

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add fractions, the denominators must be the same. We can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 52 and 82, which is 416. Then, we convert both fractions to have 416 as the denominator.

For 20/52, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 8: 20*8/52*8 = 160/416.

For 75/82, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 5: 75*5/82*5 = 375/410.

Now, we can add the fractions: 160/416 + 375/410. To do this, we find a common denominator, which is 416. We can rewrite 375/410 as 375*4/410*4 = 1500/1640.

Now, we can add the fractions: 160/416 + 1500/1640 = (160+1500)/1640 = 1660/1640.

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, which is 2. We divide both the numerator and denominator by 2: 1660/1640 Ã· 2 = 830/820.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To subtract fractions, we find a common denominator, which in this case is 420 (the least common multiple of 84 and 5).

Multiply the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by 5 and the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 84 to get the fractions with the common denominator:

92/84 * 5/5 = 460/420
31/5 * 84/84 = 252/420

Now subtract the second fraction from the first:

460/420 - 252/420 = (460 - 252)/420 = 208/420

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator, which is 4.

208/420 simplifies to 1/2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 66, 6, and 34 is 294.

Now, we convert each fraction to have the common denominator:

1) (78/66) * (34/34) = 78 * (34/66 * 34) = 2668/66

2) (28/6) * (66/66) = 28 * (66/6 * 1) = 1768/6

3) (90/34) * (66/66) = 90 * (34/34 * 66) = 5940/66

Now, we add the fractions:

2668/66 + 1768/6 + 5940/66 = (2668+1768+5940)/66 = 10376/66

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To add fractions, we need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 61 is 546.

So, we find the multiples of 18 that are less than 546: 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, 126, 144, 162, 180, 198, 216, 234, 252, 270, 288, 306, 324, 342, 360, 378, 396, 414, 432, 450, 468, 486, 504, 522, 540, 558, 576, 594, 612.

The smallest multiple of 18 that is also a multiple of 61 is 567.

Now, we find the multiples of 61 that are less than 567: 61, 122, 183, 244, 305, 366, 427, 488, 549.

The smallest multiple of 61 that is also a multiple of 18 is 108.

So, we find the multiples of 108 that are less than 546: 108, 216, 324, 432, 540.

The smallest multiple of 108 that is also a multiple of both 18 and 61 is 36.

Now, we find the multiples of 18 that are multiples of 36: 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, 216, 252, 288, 324, 360, 396, 432, 468, 486, 504, 522, 540, 558, 576, 594, 612.

The smallest multiple of 18 that is also a multiple of both 36 and 61 is 180.

Now, we find the multiples of 61 that are multiples of 36: 61, 122, 183, 244, 305, 366, 427, 488, 549.

The smallest multiple of 61 that is also a multiple of both 36 and 180 is 108.

Now, we find the multiples of 180 that are multiples of 108: 108, 216, 324, 432, 540.

The smallest multiple of 180 that is also a multiple of both 108 and 61 is 360.

Now, we find the multiples of 61 that are multiples of 360: 61, 122, 183, 244, 305, 366, 427, 488, 549.

The smallest multiple of 61 that is also a multiple of both 360 and 180 is 540.

Now, we find the multiples of 180 that are multiples of 540: 540, 1080, 1620, 2160, 2700, 3240, 3780, 4320, 4860, 5400, 5940, 6480, 7020, 7560, 8100, 8640, 9180, 9720, 10260, 10800, 11340, 11880, 12</pre>

            Calculate the following subtraction of fractions: (93 / 46) - (51 / 84). Answer as a simplified fraction.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To subtract fractions, we first find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple of 46 and 84 is 168.

Now, we convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator 168.

For 93/46:
93 * (84/84) / 46 = (744/363) * (168/168) / (46/46) = 744/46

For 51/84:
51 * (46/46) / 84 = (51*46)/(84*46) = 2292/3848

Now, we can subtract the fractions:
(744/46) - (2292/3848) = (744 - 2292) / 3848 = -1548/3848

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator, which is 2.

So, the simplified fraction is -1548/3848 divided by 2, which gives us:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 70 and 9, we list multiples of 70 and 9, and find the smallest number that appears in both lists. The LCM of 70 and 9 is 210.

Now, we convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCM as the denominator:

12/70 = (12*3)/(70*3) = 36/210
84/9 = (84*23)/(9*23) = 168/231

Now, we add the fractions:

(36/210) + (168/231) = (36+168)/(210*231) = 204/4735

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator:
GCF(204, 4735) = 3

Now, we divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF:

(204/3) / (4735/3) = 204/4735 simplified to 204/4735

The GCD of 91 and 76 is 7, so we adjust the fractions as follows:
91/76 becomes (91/76)*(7/7) = 91/56
12/22 becomes (12/22)*(2/2) = 12/44

Now, we can add the simplified fractions:
(91/56) + (12/44) = (91+12)/(56*44) = 103/2362

To simplify further, we find the GCD of 103 and 2362:
The GCD of 103 and 2362 is 1.

So, the sum of the fractions is 103/2362.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add fractions, we need to have the same denominator. First, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 83 and 21*67 = 1367. The LCM of 83 and 1367 is 1367.

Now, we convert each fraction to have the denominator 1367:
95/83 * (1367/1367) = (1153/1367)
52/21 * (633/633) = (3166/633)
75/67 * (2000/2000) = (15000/2000) = 75/1

Now, we add the fractions:
(1153/1367) + (3166/633) + (75/1)

To add the fractions with different denominators, we find the least common multiple of the denominators 1367, 633, and 1. The LCM of 1367, 633, and 1 is 1367.

Now, we convert the fraction 75/1 to have the denominator 1367:
75/1 * (1367/1367) = (102475/1367)

Now, we add the fractions:
(1153/1367) + (3166/633) + (102475/1367)

To add the fractions, we add the numerators and keep the common denominator:
(1153+3166+102475)/1367

Now, we simplify the fraction:
(1153+3166+102475)/1367 = 116794/1367

Now, we simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and the denominator:
GCF(116794, 1367) = 13

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCF:
(116794/13) / (1367/13) = 9061/105

So, we multiply the fraction 70/23 by 1 in the form of 35/35 (since 35*2 = 70 and 35*1 = 35). This gives us (78/2) - (70/23) = (78*1)/2 - (70*35/23*1) = (78 - 2450/23)/2.

To simplify the fraction 2450/23, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. This gives us 816/7.

So, the expression becomes (78 - 816/7)/2 = (78 - 816)/(2*7) = -734/14.

Since the fraction -734/14 cannot be simplified further, the answer is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 1 and 4 is 4, so we can leave the denominator of the first fraction as it is, and for the second fraction, we need to multiply the denominator by the number that makes 4 a factor, which is 1. So, we have 34/1 + 53/4 = 34 + (53*1)/4 = 34 + 13.25 = 47.25.

Since the result is greater than 1, it cannot be expressed as a fraction, so we convert it to a mixed number. To do this, we find the whole number part by rounding down to the nearest whole number, which is 47, and the fraction part is the decimal part after the decimal point, which is 0.25.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">   Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 1, 4, and 67 is 67. So, we can leave the denominator of the first fraction as it is, and for the second fraction, we need to multiply the denominator by the number that makes 67 a factor, which is 17. So, we have 24/67 + 34/1*17 + 53/4*17 = 24/67 + 577/4 + 431/4 = 24/67 + 146/4 + 107.75.

To add the fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 67 and 4 is 268. So, we need to adjust the fractions so they have the same denominator. To do this, we multiply the first fraction by 4 and the second fraction by 67/268. So, we have 24*4/67 + 577*67/4*268/268 + 431*67/4*268/268 = 96/67 + 3663/268 + 2683/268.

Now, we can add the fractions: 96/67 + 3663/268 + 2683/268 = 96 + 3663/268 + 2683/268 = 96 + 6346/268 = 96 + 23.4375.

Since the result is greater than 1, it cannot be expressed as a fraction, so we convert it to a mixed number. To do this, we find the whole number part by rounding down to the nearest whole number, which is 96, and the fraction part is the decimal part after the decimal point, which is 23.4375.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">   Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 97 and 4 is 388. So, we need to adjust the denominators of both fractions to 388.

For the first fraction, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 4 to get 34*4/97*4 = 136/388.
For the second fraction, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 97 to get 53*97/4*97 = 5169/388.

Now, we can add the fractions: 136/388 + 5169/388 = 5205/388.

Since the result is greater than 1, it cannot be expressed as a fraction, so we convert it to a mixed number. To do this, we find the whole number part by rounding down to the nearest whole number, which is 13. The fraction part is the decimal part after the decimal point, which is 0.25.

The GCD of 3 and 96 is 3, and the GCD of 36 and 96 is 36.

Adjusting the fractions:
3/36 becomes (3/3) * (1/12) = 1/12
97/96 becomes (97/3) * (1/32) = 323/32

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To add fractions, we need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 90 is 63. So, we multiply both the numerator and denominator of 16/7 by 9 to get 144/63.

Now, we multiply both the numerator and denominator of 11/90 by 10 to get 110/900.

Since 144 and 110 are not equal, the sum of the fractions cannot be expressed as a single simplified fraction.

### Answer: The sum cannot be expressed as a single simplified fraction.</pre>
