Number of starfish per square foot = Total number of starfish / Total area of seafloor
Number of starfish per square foot = 833 / 72
### Answer: 11.5625 starfish per square foot.  Note that this answer is not a whole number since it cannot be possible to have a fraction of a starfish. However, it is common to round to the nearest whole number in such cases.

In a school, there are 120 students in total. If 3/4 of the students are girls, how many students are boys?

Reasoning: We know that 3/4 of the students are girls, so the remaining students are boys.
To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.
120 - (3/4 * 120) = 120 - 90 = &lt;&lt;120-90=30&gt;&gt;30 boys.

Now, let's find out how many bracelets are in each display case after the new shipment.
Number of bracelets per display case after the new shipment = Total number of bracelets after the new shipment / Number of display cases

Average snowfall per day = Total snowfall / Number of days
Average snowfall per day = 1740 inches / 87 days = &lt;&lt;1740/87=19.89&gt;&gt;19.89 inches per day (rounded to two decimal places)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To find the cost per person, divide the total cost by the number of people.
Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people = $702 / 54 = &lt;&lt;702/54=13.0741&gt;&gt;13.0741 (approximately).
### Answer: 13.0741 (approximately)

Alternatively, you can use long division to find the quotient:

1. Write the numbers vertically:

   | 702 | 54 |
   | --- | --- |
   | 13 | 216 |
   | 130 | 429 |
   | 10 | 14 |
   | 0 | 12 |

2. Write the quotient above the dividend:

   | 702 | 54 |
   | --- | --- |
   | 13 | 216 |
   | 130 | 429 |
   | 10 | 14 |
   | 0 | 12 |
   | 13 |  |

3. Write the remainder below the dividend:

   | 702 | 54 |
   | --- | --- |
   | 13 | 216 |
   | 130 | 429 |
   | 10 | 14 |
   | 0 | 12 |
   | 13 | 0 |

4. Write the quotient above the dividend again:

   | 702 | 54 |
   | --- | --- |
   | 13 | 216 |
   | 130 | 429 |
   | 10 | 14 |
   | 0 | 12 |
   | 13 | 0 |
   | 13 |  |

5. Write the quotient as the final answer:

   | 702 | 54 |
   | --- | --- |
   | 13 | 216 |
   | 130 | 429 |
   | 10 | 14 |
   | 0 | 12 |
   | 13 | 0 |

Number of bracelets that can be made = Total number of pearls / Pearls per bracelet
Number of bracelets = 3657 / 69
### Answer: 53.69 (rounded to two decimal places)

Note: Since we cannot make a fraction of a bracelet, we will round down to the nearest whole number, which is 53 bracelets. However, if we want to account for the remaining pearls, we can say that 13 pearls are left over, which can be used to make a partial bracelet. So, the total number of bracelets made is 53 full bracelets and 1 partial bracelet.</pre>

### Answer: 47

Alternatively, you can use the cross-multiplication method:

Let x be the number of oranges in each box.

Then, we have the equation:

2820 = 60x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2820 / 60
x = 47

        <pre class="model-raw-response">   Reasoning: Since the number of boxes remains the same, we divide the new number of bottles by the number of boxes to find out how many bottles are in each box.
Number of bottles per box = New total number of bottles / Number of boxes
Number of bottles per box = 423 / 43
### Answer: 9.84 bottles per box (rounded to two decimal places). However, since it is not possible to have a fraction of a bottle, we can say that each box contains 9 bottles, with 3 bottles left over. So, there are 3 extra bottles that do not fit into the boxes.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many gifts each shelter received, we divide the total number of gifts by the number of shelters.
Number of gifts per shelter = Total gifts / Number of shelters
Number of gifts per shelter = 741 / 13
### Answer: 56.92307692307693 (rounded to 6 decimal places)

Since it is not possible to divide gifts, we round down to the nearest whole number.
