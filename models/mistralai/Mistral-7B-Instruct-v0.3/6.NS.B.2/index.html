        There are 73841 cubic centimeters of air needed to inflate a large beach ball. If we fill the ball up at a rate of 41 cubic centimeters per second, how many seconds will it take to fully inflate the beach ball?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To find the time it takes to fill the ball, we divide the volume of air needed by the rate of filling: 73841 cm^3 / 41 cm^3/s = &lt;&lt;73841/41=1796.1&gt;&gt;1796.1 seconds.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many compasses each store will receive, we divide the total number of compasses by the number of stores.
Number of compasses per store = Total compasses / Number of stores
Number of compasses per store = 33046 / 1066
### Answer: 31.24 (rounded to two decimal places)

Note: Since it is not possible to divide the compasses equally among the stores, the salesman will have to round the number of compasses given to each store. In this case, rounding to the nearest whole number would mean that some stores receive 31 compasses and others receive 32 compasses. If the salesman wants to minimize the number of stores receiving fewer compasses, he should round down to 31 compasses for each store. This would result in 1066 * 31 = 32836 compasses being distributed, leaving 33046 - 32836 = 210 compasses left over. If the salesman wants to minimize the number of stores receiving more compasses, he should round up to 32 compasses for each store. This would result in 1066 * 32 = 33856 compasses being distributed, leaving 33046 - 33856 = -810 compasses left over. However, since it is not possible to have a negative number of compasses, the salesman should round down to 31 compasses for each store.</pre>

        A star emits 51750 units of light energy every 125 seconds. How much light energy does the star emit every second?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the rate at which the star emits light energy, we divide the total light energy emitted by the time it takes to emit that energy.
Rate = Total light energy / Time = 51750 units / 125 seconds = &lt;&lt;51750/125=414&gt;&gt;414 units per second.

The total number of children in all schools is 4270 \* x.
The total number of children who had a sandwich for lunch is 34160.
So, we can set up the following equation:
4270 \* x = 34160
Solving for x, we get:
x = 34160 / 4270
x = 8.014 (rounded to two decimal places)

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">   Reasoning: To find the distance each bus travels in this week, we divide the total miles driven by the number of buses.
Distance per bus = Total miles / Number of buses

Since 18 hours is 18*30 = &lt;&lt;18*30=540&gt;&gt;540 times the rotation in 1 hour, the minute hand rotates 540*30 = &lt;&lt;540*30=16200&gt;&gt;16,200 degrees throughout 18 hours.
