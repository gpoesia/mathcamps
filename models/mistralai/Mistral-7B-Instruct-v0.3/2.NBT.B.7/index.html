            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The number of cameras left in the store after the sale is the initial number of cameras minus the number of cameras sold during the sale.
The number of cameras sold during the sale is the initial number of cameras minus the number of cameras left after the sale.
So, we can set up the following equation:
Initial number of cameras - Number of cameras sold = Number of cameras left after the sale
528 - Number of cameras sold = 414
Number of cameras sold = 528 - 414
Number of cameras sold = 114
Number of cameras left in the store after the sale = 528 - 114

            In the Planet Xoox database, it was originally thought there were 558 known alien species. After a correction that removed 66 species and added 120 from a newly discovered planet, an updated count was calculated. But what if the starting number was wrong and there were actually 567 known alien species originally, not 558? After a similar correction of removing 66 and adding 120, what would be the new total number of known alien species then?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">    Reasoning: The number of elephants that migrated away from the reserve is 573.
The number of elephants remaining in the reserve is the total number of elephants at the beginning of the year minus the number of elephants that migrated away from the reserve.
So, the number of elephants remaining in the reserve is 889 - 573 = &lt;&lt;889-573=316&gt;&gt;316.

            Susie has a goal to play 770 pages of piano music this month. She has already played through 391 pages. In addition to meeting her goal, she also wishes to learn 151 new pages of music. How many total pages of piano music does Susie still need to play and learn to meet her goal and learn all the new pieces?

To learn 151 new pages, she needs to learn 151 pages.
So, Susie needs to play and learn 379 + 151 = &lt;&lt;379+151=530&gt;&gt;530 more pages of piano music.

            Continuing from our previous problem, the ballerina, later in the evening, decided to add to her routine and performed some more pirouettes. However, she was a bit tired and was unable to count exactly how many she did. She only knew that after those additional pirouettes, the total number of pirouettes she did for the day was 314 less than if she had doubled the number of pirouettes she performed before dinner. How many pirouettes did she do after dinner?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">   Reasoning: Let's denote the number of pirouettes the ballerina did before dinner as x.
We know that x * 2 - 314 is the total number of pirouettes she did for the day, which is 575.
So, we have the equation: x * 2 - 314 = 575
Solving for x, we get:
x = (575 + 314) / 2
x = 889 / 2
x = 444.5
Since the number of pirouettes must be a whole number, the ballerina must have done 444 pirouettes after dinner.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">    Reasoning: Since the same number of children and adults attend both parties, we can find the total number of people at each party by finding the square root of the total number of people at Lucy's party.
The square root of 214 is approximately 14.64, but since the number of people must be a whole number, we round up to 15 children and 156-15 = &lt;&lt;156-15=141&gt;&gt;141 adults.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let x be the number of double beds produced.
The factory produces 90 single beds, so it produces 647 more double beds than single beds, which means it produces x - 90 double beds and 90 single beds.
Since the total number of beds produced is the same for both types, we can set up the following equation:
90 + (x - 90) = 647
Solving for x:
x - 90 = 647 - 90
x = 647 + 81
x = 728

            After carefully reviewing their records, the firefighters realized that their first count was wrong. Instead of 472 people, they had actually saved 60 people from the first fire. They still saved an additional 93 people from the second fire. How many people in total did the firefighters actually save?

            Jack is a professional mountain climber. He has a rope that is 623 meters long. He buys an additional rope to make sure he is prepared for any situation. The total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. What is the total length of the two ropes?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let x be the length of the second rope.
The total length of both ropes is 623 + x.
We know that the total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope, so we can write the equation: 623 + x = 623 + 377.
Solving for x, we get: x = 377 - 623 = -246.
However, since the length of a rope cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem.
### Answer: There is an error in the problem. The total length of the two ropes cannot be calculated with the given information.</pre>

            Let's say originally, there were actually 855 kites in the sky at the beginning of the kite festival instead of 577. After the same number of 256 kites were taken down, how many kites would have remained in the sky?

The number of kites remaining in the sky is 855 - 256 = &lt;&lt;855-256=599&gt;&gt;599.
