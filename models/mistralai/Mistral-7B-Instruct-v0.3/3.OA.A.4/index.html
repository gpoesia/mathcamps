            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: To find out how many usages can be made from the tube, we divide the total amount of toothpaste by the amount used per usage.
77 grams / 11 grams/usage = &lt;&lt;77/11=7 (with remainder 2)&gt;&gt;7 (with remainder 2) usages.
Since we cannot have a fraction of a usage, we round down to the nearest whole number.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Since there are only 3 toy mice available, each kitten can have at most 3 toy mice.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Let's denote the base of the tent as &quot;b&quot; and the vertical height as &quot;h&quot;. Since the diagonal length is the square root of (b^2 + h^2), we can write the equation:

14^2 = b^2 + h^2

Solving for h:

h^2 = 14^2 - b^2
h = sqrt(14^2 - b^2)

Since the height is half of the diagonal, we know that h = 7. So, we can set up the equation:

7 = sqrt(14^2 - b^2)

Squaring both sides:

49 = 14^2 - b^2
b^2 = 14^2 - 49
b^2 = 196 - 49
b^2 = 147
b = sqrt(147)

There are 7 days in a week, so the number of blankets made per day is 35/7 = &lt;&lt;35/7=5.0&gt;&gt;5 (approximately).
However, since it is not possible to make a fraction of a blanket, we can round up to the nearest whole number.

Solving for x:
x = 2 * 3
x = 6

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's denote the number of jumps the dolphin can make in one minute as 'a'. We know that a = 5.
We also know that when the dolphin jumps for 'p' minutes, it can jump 60 times. So, the number of jumps in 'p' minutes is 60a.
Since the number of jumps in 'p' minutes is equal to the product of the number of jumps per minute and the number of minutes, we can write the equation: 60a = 5p.
To find the value of 'p', we can solve for 'p' in terms of 'a':
p = (60a) / 5 = &lt;&lt;(60*5)/5=12&gt;&gt;12a.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The factory manufactures 6 bottles per cycle.
The number of cycles can be found by dividing the total number of bottles manufactured by the number of bottles manufactured per cycle.
48 / 6 = &lt;&lt;48/6=8&gt;&gt;8 cycles of production have been performed.

The total amount of food consumed by all giraffes in one day is 7x pounds (since each giraffe eats 7 pounds of food each day).
