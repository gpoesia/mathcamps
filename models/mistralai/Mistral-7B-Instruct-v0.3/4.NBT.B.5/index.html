            Consider the quilt maker decided to create a larger blanket this time, needing a total of 7404 pieces of cloth. How many pieces of cloth would he/she have used in this case?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">   If the quilt maker needs 7404 pieces of cloth to make a larger blanket, then the number of blankets made is 7404/4932 = &lt;&lt;7404/4932=1.4857142857142857&gt;&gt;1.4857142857142857 (approximately). Since it's not possible to make a fraction of a blanket, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2 blankets.

To find the total number of pieces of cloth used for 2 blankets, we multiply the number of pieces of cloth needed for one blanket by 2:

2 * 4932 = &lt;&lt;2*4932=9864&gt;&gt;9864 pieces of cloth.

            A telescope magnifies an object 67 times and each magnification adds 86 units to the object's size. What is the total size of the object with added magnification?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The first magnification adds 86 units to the object's size, and each subsequent magnification adds another 86 units. Since the telescope magnifies the object 67 times, we can calculate the total size by multiplying the initial size by 67 and then adding 66 times 86 (since there are 66 additional magnifications).

The initial size of the object is 0 (since we don't know it), so the total size is 67*0 + 66*86 = 5602.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">    Reasoning: The manufacturer still makes 1 pair of binoculars per day, but now each pair is sold for 7302 dollars.
The manufacturer makes 1*7302 = &lt;&lt;1*7302=7302&gt;&gt;7302 dollars per day from binoculars.
### Answer: 7302 dollars per day. utschi</pre>
