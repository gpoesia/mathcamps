        The lifeguard started the day with a certain number of towels, but after handing some out, he only had 10 remaining. If he originally had 9 more than the remaining amount, how many towels did the lifeguard start with?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's denote the original number of towels as x. After handing out some towels, he had 10 towels left, which means he handed out x-10 towels. Since he originally had 9 more towels than the remaining amount, we can write the equation: x - (x - 10) = 9. Solving for x, we get x = 19.

        A fashion designer started with a total of a certain number of blue dresses. After selling 13 of them, there were only 2 left in stock. How many blue dresses did the designer start with?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The designer started with a number of blue dresses such that when 13 were sold, 2 were left. This means that the number of blue dresses the designer started with is 13 more than twice the number of blue dresses left in stock.
So, the number of blue dresses the designer started with is 2*2 + 13 = &lt;&lt;2*2+13=15&gt;&gt;15.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The difference between the final amount and the initial amount is the amount of change received.
The change received = Final Amount - Initial Amount = 16 - 12 = &lt;&lt;16-12=4&gt;&gt;4 dollars.

        A rope manufacturing task is ongoing. From several short pieces, a worker succeeds in creating a rope that is 17 feet long. If one of these pieces was 11 feet long, how long were the rest of the pieces together?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let x be the length of the remaining pieces.
The total length of the pieces is 17 feet, and the length of one piece is 11 feet.
So, the sum of the lengths of the remaining pieces is (17-11) feet = 6 feet.
Since there is more than one piece, we cannot find the exact length of each piece. However, we can find the number of pieces.
The number of pieces is (6/x) + 1, because one piece is already accounted for (the 11-foot piece).
We don't have enough information to find the exact length of each piece, but we can find the number of pieces.
### Answer: The number of pieces is (6/x) + 1, where x is the length of the remaining pieces.</pre>

        A full grown giraffe typically grows to a height of x meters. But a young giraffe was just 1 meter shorter than a full grown one when it was 3 meters tall. What is the typical height of a fully grown giraffe in meters?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let x be the height of a full grown giraffe. Then the height of the young giraffe was (x-1) meters. At the age of 3, the young giraffe had grown to 3 meters, so we can set up the equation:

3 = (x-1) + 3(x-3)

Solving for x:

3 = x - 1 + 3x - 9
4x = 11
x = 11/4
