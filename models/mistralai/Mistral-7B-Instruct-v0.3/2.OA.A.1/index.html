In total, he spends 7+b=&lt;&lt;7+b=13-7=6&gt;&gt;6+b=13 hours working on the puzzle. Since he spends 13 hours in total, we can set up the equation: 7+b=13.

### Answer: 64 utsch! It seems there was a mistake in the question. The wind speed decreased by 35 mph, but the final wind speed was given as 29 mph. This means the initial wind speed should be 64 mph (29 mph + 35 mph), not 29 mph - 35 mph. I apologize for the confusion.</pre>
