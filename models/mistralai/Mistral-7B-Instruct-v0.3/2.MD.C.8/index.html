            Liam had $90 in twenties, tens and fives. He spent $81 on a new video game. How much money in dollars does Liam have left?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mistral 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's assume Liam had x tens and y fives. We know that x+y/5 = 90 and y = 81.
We can rearrange the first equation to y = 90 - x.
Substitute y into the second equation: 81 = 90 - x + x/5.
Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction: 405 = 450 - 5x.
Solve for x: x = 450 - 405 = 45.
Now, find the number of tens: x = 45.
Finally, find the number of fives: y = 81 - 45*5 = 81 - 225 = -144.
Since Liam cannot have a negative amount of money, there is an error in the problem.

            Amy sells candles at a market. She sells each candle for a dollar. One day, she manages to sell 58 candles in the morning and another 27 in the evening. However, she uses one of the dollars she earned to pay for her parking fee. How much money does she earn in total after paying for parking?

Since she uses one dollar for parking, she earns 85-1 = &lt;&lt;85-1=84&gt;&gt;84 dollars in total after paying for parking.

            Let's revise Amy's sales from the original problem. Instead of selling 58 candles in the morning, she only sold one. She maintained her evening sales, selling another 27 candles. However, she still needed to pay a dollar for her parking fee. How much money did Amy earn in total after paying for parking with this revised sales?
