            A box has 641 balls in total. If 284 of those balls are yellow, how many balls are not yellow?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of yellow balls is 284, and the total number of balls is 641. To find the number of non-yellow balls, we subtract the number of yellow balls from the total number of balls.
### Answer: 641 - 284 = 357

Alternatively, we can also find the number of non-yellow balls by subtracting the percentage of yellow balls from 100%. Since 284/641 is approximately 0.445, the percentage of yellow balls is 44.5%. Therefore, the percentage of non-yellow balls is 100% - 44.5% = 55.5%. To find the number of non-yellow balls, we multiply the total number of balls by the percentage of non-yellow balls.
### Answer: 641 * 0.555 = 357.265, but since we cannot have a fraction of a ball, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of mice = Total food units needed / Daily food requirement per mouse
Number of mice = 7592 / 104
### Answer: 73.28 (rounded to two decimal places)

Note: Since we cannot have a fraction of a mouse, we can assume that there are 73 mice in the group and they consume the remaining 0.28 food units among themselves. Alternatively, we can round up to 74 mice, but this would mean that some mice consume more food than others, which may not be realistic.</pre>

            After sharpening a number of pencils, a total of 127 bits of eraser were cut off. If 29 of them came from blue pencils, how many came from red pencils?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's denote the number of red pencils as R and the number of blue pencils as B. We know that B + R = 127 (total number of pencils) and that 29 eraser bits came from blue pencils.

Since the eraser bits are proportional to the number of pencils, we can set up a proportion:

29 / B = (127 - 29) / R

Solving for B:

B = (127 - 29) * (B / 29)
B = 98 * (B / 29)
B^2 = 98 * 29
B^2 = 2762
B = sqrt(2762)
B = 52.4 (approximately)

Since the number of pencils must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number:

B = 53

Now we can find the number of red pencils:

R = 127 - B
R = 127 - 53
R = 74

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

Number of plants = Total cucumbers / Cucumbers per plant
Number of plants = 242 / 22
### Answer: 11

Alternatively, you can also calculate the number of cucumbers per plant by dividing the total number of cucumbers by the number of cucumbers per plant, and then find the quotient.
Cucumbers per plant = Total cucumbers / Number of plants
Cucumbers per plant = 242 / &lt;&lt;unknown number of plants&gt;&gt;
Solving for the unknown number of plants:
Number of plants = Total cucumbers / Cucumbers per plant
Number of plants = 242 / 22
### Answer: 11

Both methods give the same result, but the first method is more efficient.</pre>

            Princess Serena has a total of 644 charms in her collection. If she gained 310 silver charms over the last year, how many gold charms did she already have in her collection?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's assume that the number of gold charms is G and the number of silver charms is S. We know that the total number of charms is 644, so G + S = 644. We also know that she gained 310 silver charms, so S = 644 - G + 310. Now we have a system of two equations:

1. G + S = 644
2. S = 644 - G + 310

We can solve this system of equations by setting the two expressions for S equal to each other:

644 - G + 310 = 644 - G

Now, we can solve for G:

2 * G = 310
G = 310 / 2
G = 155

### Answer: 438 - 69 = 369

Or, if you prefer to use algebra:
Let x be the number of cucumbers harvested this time.
The equation is: x + 69 = 438
Solving for x:
x = 438 - 69
x = 369
### Answer: 369

Alternatively, you can also write:
The number of cucumbers harvested this time is the difference between the total number of cucumbers and the number of cucumbers previously harvested.

The ratio of the new speed to the old speed is (x+19)/x.
The ratio of the new speed to the old speed is equal to the ratio of the new distance to the old distance per hour.

            The initial altitude of a mountain is 289 meters above sea level but after some tectonic activity, it is now 357 meters above sea level. By how many meters did the altitude increase after the tectonic activity?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The increase in altitude is the difference between the new and the old altitude.
The increase in altitude = 357 - 289 = &lt;&lt;357-289=68&gt;&gt;68 meters.
### Answer: 68 meters.</pre>

            If a zoo needs 4572 pounds of food to feed every monkey over a month and every single monkey eats 36 pounds of food in a month, how many monkeys are there in the zoo?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total amount of food needed for all the monkeys is 4572 pounds. Each monkey eats 36 pounds of food in a month. So, the number of monkeys is 4572/36 = &lt;&lt;4572/36=126.5&gt;&gt;126.5. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a monkey, we can round up to the nearest whole number.
### Answer: 127  (There are 127 monkeys in the zoo.)</pre>

            A doll house can hold 16 dolls in each room. If it can house a total of 832 dolls, how many rooms are in the doll house?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of rooms in the doll house is the total number of dolls divided by the number of dolls each room can hold.
Number of rooms = Total number of dolls / Dolls per room
Number of rooms = 832 / 16
Number of rooms = 52
### Answer: 52</pre>

            A luxurious watch costs $422. If the manufacturing cost is $200, how much is charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total cost of the watch is the sum of the manufacturing cost and the amount charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads.
The amount charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads is the total cost of the watch minus the manufacturing cost.
$422 - $200 = $&lt;&lt;422-200=222&gt;&gt;222 is charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads.
