            A baker baked a total of 928 cookies. He decided to distribute equal amounts of cookies to 186 orphanages. After giving out as many entire sets of cookies as possible to each orphanage, how many cookies does the baker have left?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many sets of cookies the baker can give to each orphanage. To do this, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of orphanages: 928 / 186 = &lt;&lt;928/186=4.9748275862069&gt;&gt;4.97 sets per orphanage. Since we cannot give a fraction of a set, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 4 sets per orphanage.

Now, let's calculate the number of cookies given to each orphanage: 4 * 186 = &lt;&lt;4*186=744&gt;&gt;744 cookies.

Finally, let's find out how many cookies the baker has left: 928 - 744 = &lt;&lt;928-744=184&gt;&gt;184 cookies.

            A pizza store has 975 slices of pizza ready to serve. If each pizza box can contain 196 slices, how many left over slices will there be after all the pizza boxes are full?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we find out how many full boxes can be made with 975 slices: 975 / 196 = &lt;&lt;975/196=5&gt;&gt;5 full boxes.
Since each box can contain 196 slices, the total number of slices in the 5 full boxes is 5 * 196 = &lt;&lt;5*196=980&gt;&gt;980 slices.
Now, we subtract the number of slices in the full boxes from the total number of slices: 975 - 980 = &lt;&lt;975-980=-5&gt;&gt;-5.
However, since it's not possible to have a negative number of slices, we know that there must be an error in the information provided. The number of slices should be less than 980 for all the pizza boxes to be full.

            A builder has a job to install 660 square foot tiles in a house. Each tile can cover 335 square feet. After installing tiles evenly across the available space, how many square feet will the last tile need to cover?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many tiles the builder needs to install.
Number of tiles = Total square feet / Square feet per tile = 660 / 335 = &lt;&lt;660/335=1.9724871794871796&gt;&gt;1.97 (approximately)
Since the builder cannot install a fraction of a tile, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2 tiles.

Now, let's find the remaining square feet that need to be covered by the last two tiles.
Remaining square feet = Total square feet - (Number of tiles * Square feet per tile) = 660 - (2 * 335) = 660 - 670 = -10 (negative value indicates that there is not enough space for the last two tiles)

However, since the question asks for the square feet the last tile needs to cover, we'll divide the remaining square feet by 2 to find the square feet for the last tile.
Square feet for the last tile = Remaining square feet / 2 = -10 / 2 = -5 (negative value indicates that the last tile cannot cover the remaining space)

Since it's impossible for the last tile to cover the remaining space, the builder will need to adjust the tile layout or order more tiles.
### Answer: The last tile cannot cover the remaining space.</pre>

Since there is only one zone left, the remaining tigers will be the difference between the total number of tigers and the number of tigers that can fit in the other zones: 740 - (696 * (number of zones - 1)) = 740 - (696 * (1 - 1)) = 740 - 0 = &lt;&lt;740-0=740&gt;&gt;740 tigers will be left in the last zone.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The shop makes 830 hats every week, and they plan to put 421 hats in each box. To find out how many boxes they can make, we divide the total number of hats by the number of hats per box: 830 / 421 = &lt;&lt;830/421â‰ˆ1.9724&gt;&gt;1.9724 (approximately). Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many full mailboxes the postman can fill.
Number of full mailboxes = Total letters / Letters per mailbox = 891 / 616 â‰ˆ 1.44
Since the postman cannot have a fraction of a mailbox, he can fill 1 complete mailbox and have 144 letters left.
Now, let's find out how many more letters can fit in the second-to-last mailbox.
Let x be the number of letters in the second-to-last mailbox.
616 - x = 616 - (616 - 144) = 144 + x
Solving for x, we get 2x = 760, so x = 380
The postman puts 380 letters in the second-to-last mailbox, leaving 891 - (616*1 + 380) = 891 - 996 = -95 letters in the last mailbox.
However, since it's impossible to have a negative number of letters, the postman will have to make multiple trips or use larger mailboxes to deliver all the letters.

Since we cannot divide exactly, we need to round up to 2 tents.
Each tent can host 445 people, so 2 tents can host 2 * 445 = &lt;&lt;2*445=890&gt;&gt;890 people.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a box, we will need to pack the remaining 69 teddy bears in the next box.

Alternatively, if we want to find out how many rings are left over if we fill all but one box, we can calculate the number of rings in the last box and subtract it from the total number of rings.
Number of rings in the last box = Number of rings per box * 1 = 1.013 * 1 â‰ˆ 1
Since we rounded down earlier, we need to add 1 to account for the rounding error.
Number of rings left over = Total rings - (Number of rings per box * Number of boxes - Number of rings in the last box) = 843 - (1 * 839 - 1) = 843 - 838 + 1 = 5

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The factory needs to divide 380 chairs by the number of shops that can hold 310 chairs each. Let's find out how many shops can be filled with 310 chairs each:

Number of shops = Total chairs / Chairs per shop
Number of shops = 380 / 310
Number of shops â‰ˆ 1.2258

Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a shop, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 shop left over.

Now, let's find out how many chairs are left at the factory after distributing to 1 shop:

Chairs left at the factory = Total chairs - (Chairs per shop * Number of shops)
Chairs left at the factory = 380 - (310 * 1)
Chairs left at the factory = 380 - 310
Chairs left at the factory = 70

Since the boxes can only be filled whole numbers of tomatoes, the farmer will need to round up to 2 boxes.
The total number of tomatoes packed in 2 boxes is 2*834 = &lt;&lt;2*834=1668&gt;&gt;1668 tomatoes.
The number of tomatoes left over is 929 - 1668 = &lt;&lt;929-1668=-739&gt;&gt;-739 tomatoes (which is not possible, as the number of tomatoes cannot be negative).
This means that the farmer cannot pack all the tomatoes in the larger boxes and will have to use the smaller boxes instead.

            Unicorn Village, a magical place where 265 unicorns live, is divided into 146 equal sections where these magical creatures reside. If each section is occupied by an equal number of unicorns, how many unicorns will live in the last incomplete section?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many unicorns live in one section: 265 unicorns / 146 sections = &lt;&lt;265/146=1.8181818181818183&gt;&gt;1.82 unicorns per section (approximately).
Since the number of unicorns in each section must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2 unicorns per section.
Now, let's find out how many sections are occupied: 146 sections - 1 (the last incomplete section) = &lt;&lt;146-1=145&gt;&gt;145 sections.
The total number of unicorns in the 145 complete sections is: 145 sections * 2 unicorns/section = &lt;&lt;145*2=290&gt;&gt;290 unicorns.
Since there are 265 unicorns in total, the number of unicorns in the last incomplete section is: 265 unicorns - 290 unicorns = &lt;&lt;265-290=-25&gt;&gt;-25 unicorns (since the number of unicorns must be positive, there are no unicorns in the last incomplete section).

Since each match can hold 383 players, the total number of players that can be accommodated is 3*383 = &lt;&lt;3*383=1149&gt;&gt;1149 players.
The number of players left waiting is 923 - 1149 = &lt;&lt;923-1149=-226&gt;&gt;-226 (negative means more players left than can be accommodated, so there will be no players left waiting).

Since there are 462 cannonballs in total, the number of cannonballs left uncrated is 462 - 499 = &lt;&lt;462-499=-37&gt;&gt;-37.
However, since it's not possible to have a negative number of cannonballs, we know that there must be an error in the given information or our calculations. In this case, the pirates cannot evenly distribute the cannonballs into the given number of crates without leaving some uncrated.

236 divided by 44 equals 5.363636... but since we cannot have a fraction of a step, we round down to 5 groups.
Since each group consists of 44 steps, the total number of steps in these 5 groups is 5 * 44 = &lt;&lt;5*44=220&gt;&gt;220 steps.

Number of swing sets = Total kids / Kids per swing set = 931 / 34 = &lt;&lt;931/34=27&gt;&gt;27 swing sets.
Since each swing set can accommodate 34 kids, the total number of kids that can be accommodated by all the swing sets is:
Total kids accommodated = Swing sets * Kids per swing set = 27 * 34 = &lt;&lt;27*34=918&gt;&gt;918 kids.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To make the days evenly rainy, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 612 and 29.
The GCD of 612 and 29 can be found using the Euclidean algorithm:

1. Divide 612 by 29: 612 Ã· 29 = 21 with a remainder of 4.
2. Divide the remainder (4) by the divisor (29): 4 Ã· 29 = 0 with a remainder of 4.

Since the remainder is 0, the GCD is 29.

However, since we want to find the number of inches of rain left to make the days evenly rainy, we need to subtract the GCD from the total rainfall:
612 - 29 = &lt;&lt;612-29=583&gt;&gt;583 inches.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many territories there are in the forest. We can do this by dividing the total number of animals by the number of animals each territory can support: 386 animals / 95 animals per territory = &lt;&lt;386/95=4&gt;&gt;4 territories.
Since there are 4 territories, the last territory will not be fully occupied because there are only 386 animals and not 95 * 5 = 475 animals.
To find out how many animals are left in the last not fully occupied territory, we subtract the total number of animals that can be supported by the first 3 territories from the total number of animals:
386 animals - (95 animals * 3) = 386 - 285 = &lt;&lt;386-285=101&gt;&gt;101 animals.
Since there are 4 territories, the last territory will have 101 / 4 = &lt;&lt;101/4=25.25&gt;&gt;25 animals and 25 - 95 = -70 animals. However, it's impossible to have a negative number of animals, so we round down to 25 animals in the last not fully occupied territory.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of pieces that can be made from the rope is the quotient of the total length of the rope and the length of each piece.
The number of pieces is 934/902 = &lt;&lt;934/902=1.037142857142857&gt;&gt;1 (approximately).
Since it is not possible to have a fraction of a piece, the manufacturer will cut one more piece than the quotient indicates.
The last piece will be the remainder when the total length of the rope is divided by the length of each piece.
The last piece will be 934 mod 902 = &lt;&lt;934 mod 902=32&gt;&gt;32 meters.

Since the factory made a total of 820 robots, and it can store 1368 robots in 2 storage units, the number of robots that will not fit and remain outside of the storage units is 820 - 1368 = &lt;&lt;820-1368=-548&gt;&gt;-548.

            A cloud changes its shape by reducing its water droplets. Initially, there were 516 droplets in the cloud. If the cloud loses water droplets at an equal rate and becomes entirely dry after every 289 droplets, how many droplets will be left when the cloud is dry after the final cycle?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The cloud loses 289 droplets at a time. To find out how many times the cloud loses droplets before it becomes entirely dry, we divide the initial number of droplets by the number of droplets lost per cycle: 516/289 = &lt;&lt;516/289=1.7755102040816327&gt;&gt;1.7755 (approximately).
Since the cloud cannot have a fraction of a droplet, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1.
So, the cloud goes through 1 cycle and loses 289 droplets.
After the first cycle, there are 516 - 289 = &lt;&lt;516-289=227&gt;&gt;227 droplets left.
In the second cycle, the cloud loses another 289 droplets, leaving 227 - 289 = &lt;&lt;227-289=-62&gt;&gt;-62 droplets.
Since the cloud cannot have a negative number of droplets, we know that the cloud becomes entirely dry after the first cycle, and there are no droplets left when the cloud is dry after the final cycle.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many groups of pirates there are by dividing the total number of gold coins by the number of pirates: 995 / 267 = &lt;&lt;995/267=3.7142857142857145&gt;&gt;3.714... (rounded to 4 decimal places).
Since it's not possible to divide the gold coins evenly among the pirates, we'll round down to 3 groups.
Now, let's find out how many gold coins each group will get: 995 / (267 * 3) = &lt;&lt;995/(267*3)=2.142857142857143&gt;&gt;2.142... (rounded to 4 decimal places).
Since it's not possible to divide the gold coins evenly among the groups, we'll round down to 2 gold coins per group.
Now, let's find out how many gold coins are left over: 995 - (2 * 267) = &lt;&lt;995-(2*267)=10&gt;&gt;10 gold coins.

            A pillow factory produces 589 pillows per day. They package these pillows in boxes, and each box holds 198 pillows. If they pack as many full boxes as possible, how many pillows will be left outside the boxes at the end of the day?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many full boxes can be made with the given number of pillows: 589 pillows / 198 pillows per box = &lt;&lt;589/198=2.9621052631578947&gt;&gt;3 boxes (rounded down since we cannot have a fraction of a box).
Now, let's calculate the number of leftover pillows: 589 pillows - (3 boxes * 198 pillows per box) = 589 - (3 * 198) = 589 - 594 = -5 (negative value indicates that there are actually fewer pillows than boxes).
Since it's impossible to have negative pillows, there must have been an error in the calculation. Let's assume that the factory can pack a fraction of a box. In this case, the factory can pack 3 full boxes and an additional 99/198 of a box (rounded to the nearest whole number).
The number of leftover pillows is then 589 - (3 * 198) - (198 * (99/198)) = 589 - 594 - 99 = -4 (still negative, so let's round up the number of full boxes to 4 and adjust the fraction accordingly).
Now, the factory can pack 4 full boxes and an additional 198 * (1 - (99/198)) = 198 * (197/198) = 197 pillows.
The total number of pillows is now 589 + 197 = 786.
The number of leftover pillows is then 786 - (4 * 198) = 786 - 792 = -6 (still negative, so let's round up the number of full boxes to 5 and adjust the fraction accordingly).
Now, the factory can pack 5 full boxes and an additional 198 * (1 - (99/198)) = 198 * (197/198) = 197 pillows.
The total number of pillows is now 589 + 197 + 197 = 983.
The number of leftover pillows is then 983 - (5 * 198) = 983 - 990 = -7 (still negative, so let's round up the number of full boxes to 6 and adjust the fraction accordingly).
Now, the factory can pack 6 full boxes and an additional 198 * (1 - (99/198)) = 198 * (197/198) = 197 pillows.
The total number of pillows is now 589 + 197 + 197 + 197 = 1080.
The number of leftover pillows is then 1080 - (6 * 198) = 1080 - 1188 = -108 (still negative, so let's round up the number of full boxes to 7 and adjust the fraction accordingly).
Now, the factory can pack 7 full boxes and an additional 198 * (1 - (99/198)) = 198 * (197/198) = 197 pillows.
The total number of pillows is now 589 + 197 + 197 + 197 + 197 = 1387.
The number of leftover pillows is then 1387 - (7 * 198) = 1387 - 1386 = 1 (finally, a positive number!).

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">   Reasoning: Since John already has 140 wallets, he will still distribute the coins in the same way as before:
Number of coins per wallet = Total number of coins / Number of wallets

Now, let's find out how many coins John can put in the wallets:
Coins in wallets = Number of wallets * Coins per wallet
Coins in wallets = 140 * 5 = &lt;&lt;140*5=700&gt;&gt;700 coins

Since Iron Punch can't teleport a fraction of a group, he can only teleport 4 groups of 104 people each, which is a total of 4 * 104 = &lt;&lt;4*104=416&gt;&gt;416 people.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            A tailor has 925 meters of fabric. The tailor uses 529 meters of fabric to make each dress. If the tailor uses the fabric evenly for each dress, how many meters of fabric will be left over after completing the dresses?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The tailor can make 925/529 = &lt;&lt;925/529=1.7456787143787825&gt;&gt;1.7457 dresses with the given amount of fabric.
Since the tailor cannot make a fraction of a dress, they can only make 1 complete dress and will have 925 - (529*1) = &lt;&lt;925-529=396&gt;&gt;396 meters of fabric left over.

            There are 976 tourists wanting to explore a castle. Each tour group throughout the day accommodates up to 530 people. After all the groups have taken off, how many tourists will be left for the last group of the day?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many complete groups can be formed with 976 tourists.
976 / 530 = &lt;&lt;976/530=1.8437&gt;&gt;1 (since we cannot have a fraction of a group)

Now, let's calculate the number of remaining tourists for the last group:
Remaining tourists = Total tourists - (Number of complete groups * Capacity per group)
Remaining tourists = 976 - (1 * 530) = &lt;&lt;976-(1*530)=446&gt;&gt;446
