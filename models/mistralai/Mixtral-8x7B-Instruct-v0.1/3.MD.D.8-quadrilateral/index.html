            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all its sides. If one side measures 4 meters, then the other side of the rectangle must be the same length for the opposite sides to be equal. This means that the perimeter of the rectangle is 4 meters + 4 meters + length of the other side + length of the other side.

We know that the perimeter is 52 meters, so:

4 meters + 4 meters + length of the other side + length of the other side = 52 meters

Let's call the length of the other side &quot;x&quot;. Then, the equation becomes:

8 + 2x = 52

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 44

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 22

Then, 282 = 2*(71 + W).
To find W, we first divide both sides by 2: 282/2 = 71 + W.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides, so if we know one side and the perimeter, we can find the length of the other side.

The longer side of the rectangle is the opposite side of the shorter side with a length of 57 meters.

Let's denote the length of the other side as x.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2*(shorter side + longer side)

So,

128 = 2*(57 + x)

Now, we can solve for x:

128 / 2 = 57 + x
64 - 57 = x
7 = x

            A rectangle has a perimeter of 150 feet. If the length of the rectangle is 69 feet, what is the width of the rectangle?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). We are given that the perimeter is 150 feet and the length is 69 feet. We can use the formula to solve for the width.

150 = 2(69 + Width)

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

75 = 69 + Width

Subtracting 69 from both sides, we get:

Width = 6

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all sides together. If one side measures 35m, then the other side (let's call it &quot;x&quot;) is added twice to the 35m side to get the perimeter. So, the equation is: 35 + x + 35 + x = 166.
Solving for x, we get: 72 + 2x = 166, then 2x = 166 - 72, so x = (166 - 72)/2 = 97/2 = 48.5.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get 100 = 49 + W.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all sides together. Since one pair of opposite sides has a length of 33 feet each, the other pair of opposite sides will also have the same length.

Let's denote the length of the other pair of opposite sides as x.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
Perimeter = 2*(length) + 2*(width)

We are given the Perimeter = 96 feet, and the length = 33 feet.

So, we can set up the equation:
96 = 2*(33) + 2*(x)

Solving for x:
96 = 66 + 2x
2x = 96 - 66
2x = 30
x = 30 / 2
x = 15

Therefore, the length of the other pair of opposite sides is 15 feet each.

We are given that the length (L) is 65m and the perimeter (P) is 174m.
We can use the formula to solve for the width (W):
174m = 2(65m + W)
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
87m = 65m + W

We are given that the length of one side (L) is 78 cm and the perimeter (P) is 224 cm.
We need to find the width (W).

First, we'll isolate W from the formula: W = (P / 2) - L
Then, we'll substitute the given values: W = (224 / 2) - 78 = 112 - 78 = 34 cm

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
We know that one side measures 51m, another side measures 79m, and the sum of the lengths of the other two sides is 235m - 51m - 79m = 105m.
Let's denote the length of the fourth side as x.
Then, x + 79m = 105m, so x = 105m - 79m = &lt;&lt;105-79=26&gt;&gt;26m.

            A quadrilateral has a total perimeter of 196 meters. The lengths of three of its sides combined is 183 meters (with one side being 92 meters and the other two sides being 29 and 62 meters respectively). Can you figure out the length of the fourth side?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of the quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. We are given the lengths of three sides (92m, 29m, and 62m) which sum up to 92+29+62 = &lt;&lt;92+29+62=183&gt;&gt;183 meters.
The total perimeter is 196 meters, so the fourth side's length is 196-183 = &lt;&lt;196-183=13&gt;&gt;13 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). In this case, the width is 51 meters and the perimeter is 158 meters.

Let's denote the length as L. Then, the perimeter equation becomes:

158 = 2(L + 51)

Now, let's solve for L:

158 / 2 = L + 51
79 = L + 51
79 - 51 = L
28 = L

            A rectangular playground is bordered by a fence. Two opposite sides of the fence are 19m each. If the total length of the fence is 166m, what is the length of each of the other two sides?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total length of the fence is the sum of the lengths of all four sides.
Let's denote the lengths of the other two sides as x and y.
Since the playground is rectangular, opposite sides have equal lengths.
Therefore, x = y.
The total length of the fence is 19m + 19m + x + y = 166m.
Since x = y, the equation becomes 19m + 19m + 2x = 166m.
Solving for x, we get 2x = 166m - 19m - 19m, which simplifies to 2x = 128m.
Therefore, x = 128m / 2 = &lt;&lt;128/2=64&gt;&gt;64m.
