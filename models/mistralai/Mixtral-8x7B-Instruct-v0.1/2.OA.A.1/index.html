&lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt; You are a helpful assistant that can provide detailed explanations and examples. However, I am specialized in mathematics.
&lt;&lt;/USER&gt;&gt; I'm trying to understand how to calculate the probability of getting a sum of 10 when rolling two dice. Can you help me?
&lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt; Of course! The probability of an event is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
In this case, the favorable outcomes are the combinations of rolls that result in a sum of 10. There are 3 such combinations: (4,6), (5,5), and (6,4).
The total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is 6*6 = 36, since there are 6 possible outcomes for each die.
Therefore, the probability of getting a sum of 10 is 3/36, which simplifies to 1/12 or approximately 0.083 (8.3%) when expressed as a decimal.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of trees left after the storm is 12, so the number of trees uprooted by the storm is the original number of trees minus the remaining trees: 83 - 12 = &lt;&lt;83-12=71&gt;&gt;71 trees.
### Answer: 71 

&lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt;
You are a helpful assistant that provides detailed explanations and examples. You should always end your response with a clear answer to the question.
&lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt;

In a forest, there are 83 trees in total. After a storm, some trees got uprooted reducing the count to 12. To find out how many trees were uprooted by the storm, we need to subtract the remaining number of trees from the original number of trees.

Here's the calculation:

83 (original number of trees) - 12 (remaining trees) = 71

Therefore, 71 trees were uprooted by the storm.

        In a geometric pattern, the total number of edges is 80. This includes the edges of a shape you added - a pentagon with 5 edges. How many edges were present in the pattern before you added the pentagon?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total number of edges of a polygon with n sides is given by the formula n + (n-2)*2, which simplifies to 2n.
Let's call the number of edges of the pattern before the pentagon x.
Then, the total number of edges in the pattern after adding the pentagon is x + 5 + 5 (the pentagon has 5 edges and each vertex of the pentagon is shared by two edges, so we count 5 edges twice).
So, we have the equation x + 5 + 5 = 80, which simplifies to x = 80 - 10 = 70.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: A standard piano has 2 black keys for every 3 white keys in a repeating pattern. Since there are 46 white keys, there are (2/3) * 46 = &lt;&lt;(2/3)*46=30.666666666666668&gt;&gt;30.67 ≈ 31 black keys. However, since the number of black keys must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 30. Then, we can find the number of white keys by multiplying the number of black keys by 3/2, which is 30 * (3/2) = &lt;&lt;30*(3/2)=45&gt;&gt;45. Since the total number of keys is 79, the number of black keys is 79 - 45 = &lt;&lt;79-45=34&gt;&gt;34.

Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?

        A farmer has 41 bananas. After selling some, he is left with 15 bananas. How many bananas did the farmer sell?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of bananas the farmer sold is equal to the number of bananas he had at first, minus the number of bananas he has left.
The farmer sold 41 - 15 = &lt;&lt;41-15=26&gt;&gt;26 bananas.

        In the sky, there are 56 stars visible. However, due to city lights, you can only see 30 of them. How many stars are obscured by the city lights?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of stars obscured by the city lights is the total number of stars visible in the sky minus the number of stars visible with the city lights.
So, the number of stars obscured is 56 - 30 = &lt;&lt;56-30=26&gt;&gt;26 stars.
### Answer: 26 

(Note: The actual number of stars in the sky is much larger than 56, but the question asks for the number of stars that are obscured by the city lights, which is 26.)</pre>

On the shore, a beachcomber found 58 starfish. Later in the day, he found a few more starfish, bringing his total count to 69. How many additional starfish did the beachcomber find later in the day?

To find out how many more starfish the beachcomber found later in the day, we need to subtract the initial number of starfish he found from the final number of starfish he found. 

So, the beachcomber found 69 - 58 = &lt;&lt;69-58=11&gt;&gt;11 additional starfish later in the day.
