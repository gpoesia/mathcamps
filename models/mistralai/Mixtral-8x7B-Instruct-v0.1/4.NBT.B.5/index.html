Total amount saved = Amount saved per year * Number of years

### Answer: 49,174 carrots. 

&lt;|endoftext|&gt;A farmer manages to grow 41 carrots in each of his 21 vegetable patches. How many carrots does the farmer have in total?

The farmer has now evolved his farming techniques and grown a record-breaking 1194 carrots from each of his 41 vegetable patches. How many carrots does he have now?

To solve these problems, we need to multiply the number of carrots grown in each patch by the number of patches.

For the first problem, the farmer grows 41 carrots in each of his 21 patches, so the total number of carrots is 41*21 = 861 carrots.

For the second problem, the farmer grows 1194 carrots in each of his 41 patches, so the total number of carrots is 1194*41 = 49,174 carrots.

Therefore, the answers to the questions are:

### Answer: The farmer has 861 carrots in total.

The question asks for the total number of photos scanned, which is calculated by multiplying the number of photos scanned per day by the number of days.

### Answer: 30644 

&lt;|endoftext|&gt;A company sells 12000 boxes of cereal in January and then doubles the number of boxes sold each month. If they continue this pattern for 6 months, how many boxes will they sell in total during these 6 months?

Reasoning: The number of boxes sold in each month is as follows:

- January: 12000
- February: 12000 \* 2 = 24000
- March: 24000 \* 2 = 48000
- April: 48000 \* 2 = 96000
- May: 96000 \* 2 = 192000
- June: 192000 \* 2 = 384000

The total number of boxes sold in 6 months is 12000 + 24000 + 48000 + 96000 + 192000 + 384000 = &lt;&lt;12000+24000+48000+96000+192000+384000=756000&gt;&gt;756000.
