        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The carpenter now has 4322 inches of wood, and each door requires 80 inches of wood.
Therefore, the carpenter can make 4322/80 = &lt;&lt;4322/80=54.025&gt;&gt;54.025 doors with the 4322 inches of wood.
However, the carpenter cannot make a fraction of a door, so he can make 54 doors with the 4322 inches of wood.
### Answer: 54 doors 

(Note: The carpenter cannot make 0.025 of a door, so the number of doors is rounded down to the nearest whole number.)</pre>

However, it is not possible to divide 5005 coins evenly among 97 pirates and have a fraction of a coin for each pirate. In this case, the extra coins would need to be distributed among the pirates in some other way, such as giving each pirate an extra coin and having one leftover coin.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The child makes 16 snowballs with the same amount of snow used for the new giant snowball. So, the total volume of the 16 smaller snowballs should be equal to the volume of the new giant snowball.
The volume of each smaller snowball = Volume of the new giant snowball / Number of smaller snowballs
= 3327 cubic feet / 16
= &lt;&lt;3327/16=207.9375&gt;&gt;207.9375 cubic feet
Since the volume of a snowball must be a whole number, we can assume that the child used only a part of the last smaller snowball to reach the total volume of 3327 cubic feet.
### Answer: The volume of each smaller snowball is approximately 207.94 cubic feet.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            A slide is 728 inches long and has evenly spaced waves every 56 inches. How many waves are there on the slide?

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the number of waves on the slide, we need to divide the total length of the slide by the distance between each wave.
The number of waves is therefore 728/56 = &lt;&lt;728/56=13&gt;&gt;13.
### Answer: 13 waves</pre>

            The slide in the amusement park is being redesigned, and its new length is 3769 inches. The waves are still placed every 56 inches. How many waves will the redesigned slide have now?

The number of waves is therefore 3769/56 = &lt;&lt;3769/56=67&gt;&gt;67.
### Answer: 67 waves 

(Note: The number of waves is determined by the length of the slide, not the number of waves on the previous design.)</pre>
