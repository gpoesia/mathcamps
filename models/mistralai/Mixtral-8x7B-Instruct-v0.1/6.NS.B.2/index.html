            If instead, the star emitted a total of 94548 units of light energy over a shorter period of 3349 hours, still at a constant rate, how much light energy would it emit every hour now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The star emits the same amount of light energy every hour. So, to find the amount of light energy emitted every hour, we can divide the total light energy emitted over the period by the number of hours in that period.
The star emits 94548/3349 = &lt;&lt;94548/3349=28.25&gt;&gt;28.25 units of light energy every hour.
### Answer: 28.25 
(Note: The answer is expressed as a decimal number, but the actual amount of light energy emitted is still measured in whole units. This means that the star emits 28 units of light energy every hour, and emits the remaining 0.25 units of light energy by emitting slightly more light in some hours than in others.)</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Following the previous scenario of the firefighter unit, suppose the total number of fires they actually extinguished over the period was 45843, but the time frame was 4913 weeks instead of 413 weeks. If they extinguished the same number of fires each week, how many fires did they extinguish per week now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The firefighter unit extinguished 45843/4913 = &lt;&lt;45843/4913=9.32&gt;&gt;9.32 fires per week.
Since the number of fires extinguished must be a whole number, there is a contradiction in the scenario. It is not possible for the firefighter unit to extinguish the same number of fires each week for 4913 weeks and end up with a total of 45843 fires.

9060 grams / 306 grams/brushing = &lt;&lt;9060/306=29.61&gt;&gt;29.61 brushing
Since you can't brush your teeth a fraction of a time, you can only brush your teeth 29 times with this tube of toothpaste.
### Answer: 29 

It's important to note that the number of brushing is rounded down to the nearest whole number because you can't brush your teeth a fraction of a time.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the average daily weight gain, we need to divide the total weight gained by the number of days.
The baby gained 3734 grams in 1867 days.
So, the baby gained 3734/1867 = &lt;&lt;3734/1867=2.00&gt;&gt;2.00 grams per day on average.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To find the average number of minutes of advertisements shown each day, we can divide the total number of minutes by the number of days.

Minutes of advertisements per day = Total minutes of advertisements / Number of days

Therefore, on average, the TV channel broadcasts 951 minutes of advertisements each day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many pen units each retailer received, we need to divide the total number of pen units by the number of retailers.
Pen units per retailer = Total pen units / Number of retailers
Pen units per retailer = 9636 / 44
