            First, add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65. Then subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result. What is the result expressed as a simple fraction?

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> First, find the common denominator of 9 and 65, which is 585.

88/9 becomes (88 \* 65) / 585 = 5720 / 585

28/65 becomes (28 \* 9) / 585 = 252 / 585

Now add the fractions:

5720 / 585 + 252 / 585 = 5972 / 585

Now subtract 18/37 from the result:

5972 / 585 - (18 \* 16) / (37 \* 16) = 5972 / 585 - 288 / 592

The common denominator of 585 and 592 is 35520.

5972 / 585 becomes (5972 \* 60) / 35520 = 358320 / 35520

592 / 585 becomes (592 \* 60) / 35520 = 35520 / 35520

288 / 592 becomes (288 \* 60) / 35520 = 17280 / 35520

Now subtract:

358320 / 35520 - 17280 / 35520 = 341040 / 35520

Simplify the fraction:

341040 / 35520 = 34104 / 3552 = 8526 / 888 = 4263 / 444 = 1421 / 148

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we simplify 63/41 to the lowest terms, which is already in the lowest terms since 63 and 41 are both prime numbers.
Next, we simplify 44/50 to the lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4: 44/4 = 11 and 50/4 = 12.5, so 44/50 simplifies to 11/12.5.
Now, we can add the two simplified fractions: 63/41 + 11/12.5.
To add fractions, we need to have the same denominator, so we convert 63/41 to have a denominator of 12.5 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 12.5/41: (63/41)*(12.5/12.5) = 19.6875/12.5.
Now, we can add the two fractions: 19.6875/12.5 + 11/12.5 = (19.6875 + 11)/12.5 = 30.6875/12.5.
The fraction 30.6875/12.5 cannot be simplified further, so this is the final answer.
### Answer: 30.6875/12.5 or approximately 2.455 when expressed as a decimal.</pre>

71/41 * (3307/3307) = 239/3307

41/77 * (41/41) = 168/3307

Now, we add the two fractions:

239/3307 + 168/3307 = 407/3307

Simplifying the fraction:

407/3307 is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> First, find a common denominator for 65 and 35. The least common multiple of 65 and 35 is 260, so convert both fractions to have this common denominator.

10/65 becomes (10*4)/260 = 40/260, which simplifies to 2/13.
56/35 becomes (56*8)/260 = 448/260, which simplifies to 12/5.

Now add the two simplified fractions:

2/13 + 12/5 = (2*5)/(13*5) + (12*13)/(5*13) = 10/65 + 156/65 = 166/65.

This fraction does not simplify, so the final answer is 166/65.

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 56 and 50 is 280.

89/56 = (89 \* 5)/(56 \* 5) = 445/280
48/50 = (48 \* 6)/(50 \* 6) = 288/300

Now, we can add the fractions: 445/280 + 288/300 = (445 \* 300 + 288 \* 280)/(280 \* 300) = 133650/84000

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD of 133650 and 84000 is 1050.

So, 133650/84000 = (133650/1050)/(84000/1050) = 127/76

So, we convert 33/41 to 33 \* 41/1682 = 1383/1682 and 95/62 to 95 \* 27/1682 = 2565/1682.
Then, we add the two fractions: 1383/1682 + 2565/1682 = (1383 + 2565)/1682 = 3948/1682.

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the values inside the parentheses:
(30 / 11) + (72 / 38) = (30 \* 38) / (11 \* 38) + (72 \* 11) / (38 \* 11) = 1140 / 418 + 792 / 418 = 1932 / 418

Now, we need to add this result to (81 / 34):
(1932 / 418) + (81 / 34) = (1932 \* 34) / (418 \* 34) + (81 \* 418) / (34 \* 418) = 66084 / 14212 + 33658 / 14212 = 99742 / 14212

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator:
GCD(99742, 14212) = 14

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:
99742 / 14 = 7124.43 and 14212 / 14 = 1015.14

Since the result is not a whole number, the fraction cannot be simplified further.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the sum of (64 / 34) and (3 / 24).
To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 34 and 24. The least common multiple of 34 and 24 is 15048.

(64 / 34) can be written as (64 * 451) / 15048 = 2896 / 15048
(3 / 24) can be written as (3 * 625) / 15048 = 1875 / 15048

So, (64 / 34) + (3 / 24) = 2896 / 15048 + 1875 / 15048 = 4771 / 15048

Now, we need to add the result to (41 / 96).
To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 15048 and 96. The least common multiple of 15048 and 96 is 15048.

(4771 / 15048) can be written as (4771 / 15048)
(41 / 96) can be written as (41 * 156) / 15048 = 6376 / 15048

So, (4771 / 15048) + (41 / 96) = 4771 / 15048 + 6376 / 15048 = 11147 / 15048

The simplified fraction of (64 / 34) + (3 / 24) + (41 / 96) is (11147 / 15048).

            Daniel has to solve a math problem for his homework that includes fractions. Initially, he has been asked to add 83/73 and 53/77. The result of this step he saved as 'w'. Then, he needs to add 80/76 to the result 'w'. How would he calculate the final answer in simplified fraction form?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, Daniel needs to add the fractions 83/73 and 53/77. To do this, he needs to find a common denominator, which is 73 \* 77 = &lt;&lt;73*77=5621&gt;&gt;5621.
So, 83/73 = (83 \* 77) / 5621 = 6401/5621 and 53/77 = (53 \* 73) / 5621 = 3889/5621.
Now, he can add these two fractions: w = 6401/5621 + 3889/5621 = 10290/5621.
Next, Daniel needs to add 80/76 to the result w. To do this, he needs to find a common denominator, which is 76 \* 5621 = &lt;&lt;76*5621=425996&gt;&gt;425996.
So, w = 10290/5621 = (10290 \* 76) / 425996 = 783640/425996 and 80/76 = (80 \* 5621) / 425996 = 450080/425996.
Now, he can add these two fractions: final answer = 783640/425996 + 450080/425996 = 1233720/425996, which simplifies to 1233720/425996 = 10/3.

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions, we need to get them over a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 66 is 220, so we convert both fractions to have this denominator:

27/20 = (27 \* 11) / 220 = 297 / 220
14/66 = (14 \* 10) / 220 = 140 / 220

Now we can add the fractions: 297/220 + 140/220 = (297 + 140) / 220 = 437 / 220

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7:

437 / 7 = 62.43, 220 / 7 = 31.43

Then, subtract (32/76) from the sum:
2040/455 - (32/76) = 2040/455 - 160/76 = 2040/455 - 120/55 = 360/55 - 120/55 = 240/55

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, calculate the value of (75 / 45) + (5 / 49).

The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 75 and 45 is 15, so (75 / 45) simplifies to (5 / 3).
The greatest common divisor (gcd) of 5 and 49 is 1, so (5 / 49) cannot be simplified further.

So, (75 / 45) + (5 / 49) = (5 / 3) + (5 / 49).

The least common multiple (lcm) of 3 and 49 is 147, so convert (5 / 3) to (145 / 147).

So, (5 / 3) + (5 / 49) = (145 / 147) + (5 / 49) = (145 + 15) / 147 = 160 / 147.

Now, add 3 / 58 to the result.

The least common multiple (lcm) of 147 and 58 is 4062, so convert 160 / 147 to 2720 / 4062 and 3 / 58 to 69 / 4062.

So, 160 / 147 + 3 / 58 = 2720 / 4062 + 69 / 4062 = (2720 + 69) / 4062 = 2789 / 4062.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find the value of (78 / 45) + (89 / 36). To do this, find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 1080 (the least common multiple of 45 and 36).

(78 / 45) + (89 / 36) = (78 \* 24) / 1080 + (89 \* 30) / 1080 = 1872 / 1080 + 2670 / 1080 = 4542 / 1080

Now, to add this sum to itself, we simply multiply the sum by 2:

(4542 / 1080) \* 2 = 9084 / 1080

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9084 and 1080, which is 72.

9084 / 72 = 126
1080 / 72 = 15

So, we convert 86/35 to have a denominator of 2975: 86/35 \* (2975/2975) = 249750/10725.
Similarly, we convert 68/85 to have a denominator of 2975: 68/85 \* (35/35) = 2380/2975.
Now, we can add the two fractions: 249750/10725 + 2380/2975 = 249750/10725 + 5233/10725 = 255083/10725.

            Consider the fraction 90/81. Add it to 2/66 and simplify your answer to the simplest form. What is the result?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to convert the fractions to a common denominator. The least common multiple of 81 and 66 is 198.

90/81 = (90 \* 2)/162 = 180/162

2/66 = (2 \* 3)/231 = 6/77

Now, we can add the fractions:

180/162 + 6/77 = (180 \* 77)/(162 \* 77) + (6 \* 162)/(77 \* 162) = 13920/12342 + 972/12342 = 14972/12342

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator:

GCD(14972, 12342) = 134

Now, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:

14972 / 134 = 111
12342 / 134 = 92

So, the simplified form of the fraction is 111/92.

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 92/75 and 66/92, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator of 75 and 92 is 6420.
So, 92/75 = (92 \* 85) / 6420 = 7820 / 6420
And, 66/92 = (66 \* 69) / 6420 = 4534 / 6420
Now, we can add the fractions: 7820 / 6420 + 4534 / 6420 = 12354 / 6420
Simplifying the fraction: 12354 / 6420 = 6617 / 3580 = 3308.5 / 1790 = 19 / 10 + 3 / 10 - 1 / 1790

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the difference between two fractions, we first need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator of 34 and 86 is 282 (the least common multiple of 34 and 86).
So, we convert 51/34 to have a denominator of 282: 51/34 = (51*8)/(34*8) = 408/272.
Similarly, we convert 12/86 to have a denominator of 282: 12/86 = (12*3)/(86*3) = 36/258.
Now, we can find the difference: 408/272 - 36/258 = (408*258 - 36*272)/(272*258) = (105888 - 9568)/69936 = 96320/69936.
We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 16: 96320/16 = 6020 and 69936/16 = 4371.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to convert the whole number 51 to a fraction, which is 51/1. Then, we add 51/1 to 93/8. To do this, we need to find a common denominator, which is 8 in this case. So, we convert 51/1 to 408/8 (51*8=408 and 1*8=8) and add it to 93/8 to get 408+93=501/8.
Next, we add 501/8 to 58/44. Again, we need to find a common denominator, which is 396 in this case (8*49=392 and 44*9=396). So, we convert 501/8 to 24045/396 (501*49=24045 and 8*49=392) and add it to 58/44 to get 24045+248=24293/396.
Finally, we simplify the fraction 24293/396 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 13. So, we get 24293/396 = 1868/31, which is the final result.

The fraction 1378/90 cannot be simplified further, as there are no common factors in the numerator and the denominator. However, we can simplify the answer by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (which is 2).
1378/90 = (1378/2)/(90/2) = 689/45
### Answer: 689/45 

(Note: The answer can be further simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (which is 17), but this is not necessary.)</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 12/18 and 91/74, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 74 is 648.

12/18 = (12 \* 36) / (18 \* 36) = 432 / 648
91/74 = (91 \* 8) / (74 \* 8) = 728 / 592

Now, we can add the numerators and keep the common denominator:

(432 + 728) / 648 = 1160 / 648

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1160 and 648. The GCD of 1160 and 648 is 8.

1160 / 8 = 145
648 / 8 = 81

Change the second fraction to have a common denominator with the first fraction: (93 / 7) = (93 * 69) / (7 * 69) = 6381 / 483

Now, add the fractions: (68 / 69) + (6381 / 483) = (68 * 483) / (69 * 483) + (6381 * 69) / (483 * 69) = 32864 / 32867

Now, add this result to (3 / 46): (32864 / 32867) + (3 / 46) = (32864 * 46) / (32867 * 46) + (3 * 32867) / (46 * 32867) = 1524568 / 1402462

            Firstly, calculate the sum of 92/54 and 90/13, then from the result take away 46/41. What's the result as a simplified fraction?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to convert the fractions so they have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 54 and 13 is 669, so we get:

92/54 = (92 \* 12)/(54 \* 12) = 1104/648
90/13 = (90 \* 51)/(13 \* 51) = 4590/669

Now, we can add these two fractions:

1104/648 + 4590/669 = (1104 \* 669 + 4590 \* 648)/(648 \* 669) = 1238520/439992

Next, we subtract 46/41 from this result:

(1238520/439992) - (46/41) = (1238520 \* 41 - 46 \* 439992)/(439992 \* 41) = (50946320 - 20159712)/18179712 = 30786608/18179712

Finally, we simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8:

30786608/18179712 = (30786608/8) / (18179712/8) = 3848326/2272464

Again, we simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8:

3848326/2272464 = (3848326/8) / (2272464/8) = 481040.75/284058

Again, we simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

481040.75/284058 = (481040.75/2) / (284058/2) = 240520.375/142029

Again, we simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

240520.375/142029 = 240520.375/142029

Since this fraction cannot be simplified further, this is the final answer.

Simplify the numerator:

(1.136363636... + 1.327868852...).
Then, we add the results:
2.464232488...
To reduce this decimal number to a fraction, we need to determine the common denominator of 66 and 61, which is 66 \* 61 = 4026.
We convert the decimal number to a fraction by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by a power of 10 to make the numerator a whole number:
2.464232488... \* 10000 = 24642.32488... / 10000 = 24642 / 10000.
Now, we convert the numerator to an equivalent value with the common denominator:
24642 = 24642 \* (61 / 61) = (24642 \* 61) / 61 = 1506306 / 61.

Now, we need to find c = l + 99/92

First, we need to have the same denominator for the fractions in c. The least common denominator of 198 and 92 is 9504.

c = (1250 \* 48)/9504 + (99 \* 99)/9504

c = 59600/9504 + 9801/9504

c = (59600 + 9801)/9504

c = 69401/9504

Now, we need to simplify the fraction c.

The greatest common divisor of 69401 and 9504 is 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 75/65 and 7/39, we need to get them over a common denominator. The least common multiple of 65 and 39 is 2610. So, we convert the fractions to have this common denominator:

75/65 = (75 \* 41) / (65 \* 41) = 3075 / 2665

7/39 = (7 \* 68) / (39 \* 68) = 476 / 2665

Now, we can add the fractions:

3075 / 2665 + 476 / 2665 = (3075 + 476) / 2665 = 3551 / 2665

The fraction 3551/2665 cannot be simplified further, so this is the final answer.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, calculate the value of 79/1 - 30/92.
To do this, find a common denominator for 1 and 92. The least common multiple of 1 and 92 is 92.
79/1 - 30/92 = 79 - 30/92 = 79 - 3/92 = 78.875

Next, subtract 61/63 from the result.
To do this, find a common denominator for 92 and 63. The least common multiple of 92 and 63 is 2016.
78.875 \* (2016/2016) - 61/63 \* (33/33) = 15942.5/2016 - 2003/2016 = 13939.5/2016

(69/63 + 77/5) = (69/63 \* 5/5 + 77/5 \* 63/63) = (345/315 + 4809/315) = 5154/315 gallons

Then, we add the 47/71 gallons he received from Sally:

5154/315 + 47/71 = (5154 \* 71/315 + 47 \* 45/71) / (71 \* 5/71) = (367108/2205 + 2115/71) / 5 = (367108 + 30015)/(5 \* 2205) = 397123/11025 gallons

So, 59/52 = (59 * 16) / 832 = 944 / 832 and 70/32 = (70 * 26) / 832 = 1820 / 832.
Now, we can add the fractions: 944 / 832 + 1820 / 832 = (944 + 1820) / 832 = 2764 / 832.
The fraction 2764 / 832 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4: 2764 / 832 = (2764 / 4) / (832 / 4) = 691 / 208.

Now, we need to add this sum to 42/41.
To add the fractions 691/208 and 42/41, we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator of 208 and 41 is 208 * 41 = &lt;&lt;208*41=8568&gt;&gt;8568.
So, 691/208 = (691 * 41) / 8568 = 28491 / 8568 and 42/41 = (42 * 208) / 8568 = 8736 / 8568.
Now, we can add the fractions: 28491 / 8568 + 8736 / 8568 = (28491 + 8736) / 8568 = 37227 / 8568.
The fraction 37227 / 8568 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9: 37227 / 8568 = (37227 / 9) / (8568 / 9) = 4136.33 / 952.

So, 74/52 = (74 \* 16) / 832 = 1184 / 832 and 70/32 = (70 \* 26) / 832 = 1820 / 832.
Now, we can add the fractions: 1184 / 832 + 1820 / 832 = (1184 + 1820) / 832 = 3004 / 832.
The fraction 3004 / 832 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4: 3004 / 832 = (3004 / 4) / (832 / 4) = 751 / 208.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To subtract two fractions, we need to get a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator of 84 and 5 is 420.
So, we convert 31/5 to 31 \* 84/5 \* 84 = 22104/5 = 5526/125.
And we convert 92/84 to 92 \* 125/84 \* 125 = 115000/105125.

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the difference between 69/21 and 10/92, we first need to get them over a common denominator. The least common multiple of 21 and 92 is 588 (21*28 and 92*6).

So, we convert 69/21 to have a denominator of 588 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 28:
69/21 * (28/28) = 1912/588

We convert 10/92 to have a denominator of 588 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 6:
10/92 * (6/6) = 60/588

Now, we can find the difference:
1912/588 - 60/588 = (1912-60)/588 = 1852/588

Finally, we simplify the fraction:
1852/588 = 463/147

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, find the common denominator of 66, 6, and 34, which is 204.
Then, convert each fraction to have this common denominator.
78/66 becomes (78 \* 3)/204 = 234/204, which simplifies to 1 1/3.
28/6 becomes (28 \* 34)/204 = 952/204, which simplifies to 4 23/51.
90/34 becomes (90 \* 6)/204 = 540/204, which simplifies to 15/6.
Now, add the simplified fractions: 1 1/3 + 4 23/51 + 15/6.
To add the fractions, first convert 1 1/3 to 4/3 and 15/6 to 5/2.
Now, add the fractions: 4/3 + 4 23/51 + 5/2.
The least common denominator is 102, so convert the fractions: 8/102 + 260/102 + 255/102.
Now, add the fractions: 573/102, which simplifies to 1 53/102.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we perform the division operations:
(12 / 7) - (9 / 23) = 1.71428571 - 0.391304348

To simplify the result to the lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator of the result:

GCD(1322981362, 10000000) = 1964614

Now, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:

1322981362 / 1964614 = 673
10000000 / 1964614 â‰ˆ 5.087

So, the simplified result is:

So, 32/3 becomes (32 * 32) / 276 = 320 / 276 and 40/92 becomes 40 / 276.
Now, we can subtract 40 / 276 from 320 / 276, which is (320 - 40) / 276 = 280 / 276.
Doubling this result gives us 2 * 280 / 276 = 560 / 276, which simplifies to 56 / 34.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions, we need to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 76 and 22 is 184. So, we convert each fraction to have this denominator:

91/76 = (91 \* 2) / 152 = 182/152

12/22 = (12 \* 7) / 154 = 84/154

Now, we can add the fractions: 182/152 + 84/154 = (182 \* 154 + 84 \* 152) / (152 \* 154) = 28092/23648

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD of 28092 and 23648 is 1056.

So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD: 28092 / 1056 = 26.666... and 23648 / 1056 = 22.444...

### Answer: The sum of 91/76 and 12/22 is 26.666... (repeating), or in simplified form, 28092/23648.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> The result of adding 34/1 to 53/4 is 189/4. Now, add 24/67 to 189/4.

First, find a common denominator for the fractions 24/67 and 189/4. The least common multiple of 67 and 4 is 268. So, convert 24/67 to have a denominator of 268: 24/67 * 4/4 = 96/268. Convert 189/4 to have a denominator of 268: 189/4 * 67/67 = 12633/268.

Now, add the fractions: 96/268 + 12633/268 = (96 + 12633)/268 = 12729/268.

Convert 12729/268 to a mixed number: 12729/268 = 47 remainder 111, so 12729/268 = 47 111/268.

Now, add the fractions: 34/97 + 5151/388 = (34 \* 4 + 5151)/388 = 5185/388.

Convert 5185/388 to a mixed number: 5185/388 = 13 remainder 207, so 5185/388 = 13 207/388.

Since 207 is greater than 388, divide 207 by 388 to get a quotient and remainder: 207/388 = 0 remainder 207.

So, 5185/388 = 13 + 0 + 207/388 = 13 0 207/388.

So, the expression becomes: (92/95) + (1/18).

To add the fractions, find a common denominator, which is 1710 (the least common multiple of 95 and 18).

Convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

(92 \* 18) / 1710 + (1 \* 95) / 1710 = 1656 / 1710 + 95 / 1710

Now, add the fractions: (1656 + 95) / 1710 = 1751 / 1710

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 12/33 and 49/2, we first need to get a common denominator. The least common multiple of 33 and 2 is 66, so we convert 49/2 to 147/66.
Then, we add the fractions: 12/33 + 147/66 = (12 + 147)/66 = 159/66.
To convert the improper fraction 159/66 to a mixed fraction, we divide 159 by 66 to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 33.
### Answer: 2 33/66 (or simplified: 2 1/2)</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            After obtaining the result from the previous problem, where you added two fractions both equal to 78/65, what would you get if you add the result to 71/32?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> First, we need to find a common denominator for the fraction 71/32. The least common multiple of 32 and 65 is 208.

We convert 78/65 to have a denominator of 208 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 3: (78 \* 3) / (65 \* 3) = 234 / 195

Now, we can add the two fractions: 234 / 195 + 71 / 32

To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 195 \* 2 = 390.

We convert 71 / 32 to have a denominator of 390 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 12: (71 \* 12) / (32 \* 12) = 852 / 384

Now, we can add the two fractions: 234 / 195 + 852 / 384

Since the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators: 234 + 852 = 1086

The final answer is 1086 / 390, which simplifies to 362 / 130.
### Answer: 362 / 130 or approximately 2.785 when rounded to four decimal places.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 16/7 and 11/90, we need to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 90 is 630.
So, we convert 16/7 to 16*90/7*90 = 1440/630 and 11/90 to 11*7/90*7 = 77/630.
Then, we add the two fractions: 1440/630 + 77/630 = 1517/630.
Finally, we simplify the fraction: 1517/630 = 1009/420.
