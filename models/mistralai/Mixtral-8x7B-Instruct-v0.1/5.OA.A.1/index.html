### Answer: 77 

&lt;|endoftext|&gt;If a stationery store has 40 white erasers and 74 pink erasers, how many erasers are there in total?

To find the total number of erasers, we simply add the number of white erasers to the number of pink erasers.

Total erasers = White erasers + Pink erasers
Total erasers = 40 + 74
Total erasers = 114

So, there are 114 erasers in total at the stationery store.

Answer: 114 erasers in total.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find out how much snow fell in total over the past two days. This is done by adding the snowfall from yesterday and today: 93 cm + 29 cm = &lt;&lt;93+29=122&gt;&gt;122 cm.
Then, we subtract the amount of snow that has melted from the total snowfall: 122 cm - 20 cm = &lt;&lt;122-20=102&gt;&gt;102 cm.

Then, we subtract the amount of snow that has melted from the total snowfall: 183 cm - 20 cm = &lt;&lt;183-20=163&gt;&gt;163 cm.

[10] A group of friends want to buy a gift for their teacher that costs $120. They want to share the cost equally. If there are 6 friends, how much will each friend contribute?

Reasoning: The total cost of the gift is $120.

Therefore, each friend will contribute $120 / 6 = $&lt;&lt;120/6=20&gt;&gt;20.

A bag contains 12 red, 15 blue, and 17 green marbles. If a marble is randomly drawn from the bag, what is the probability that it is not red?

Reasoning: There are a total of 12 red + 15 blue + 17 green = &lt;&lt;12+15+17=44&gt;&gt;44 marbles in the bag.
The probability of drawing a non-red marble is the number of non-red marbles (44-12 = &lt;&lt;44-12=32&gt;&gt;32) divided by the total number of marbles (44).

A bag contains 12 red, 15 blue, and 17 green marbles. If a marble is randomly drawn from the bag, what is the probability that it is not blue?

Reasoning: There are a total of 12 red + 15 blue + 17 green = &lt;&lt;12+15+17=44&gt;&gt;44 marbles in the bag.
The probability of drawing a non-blue marble is the number of non-blue marbles (44-15 = &lt;&lt;44-15=29&gt;&gt;29) divided by the total number of marbles (44).

A bag contains 12 red, 15 blue, and 17 green marbles. If a marble is randomly drawn from the bag, what is the probability that it is not green?

Reasoning: There are a total of 12 red + 15 blue + 17 green = &lt;&lt;12+15+17=44&gt;&gt;44 marbles in the bag.
The probability of drawing a non-green marble is the number of non-green marbles (44-17 = &lt;&lt;44-17=27&gt;&gt;27) divided by the total number of marbles (44).
### Answer: 27/44 or 9/16

A bag contains 12 red, 15 blue, and 17 green marbles. If a marble is randomly drawn from the bag, what is the probability that it is not red or blue?

Reasoning: There are a total of 12 red + 15 blue + 17 green = &lt;&lt;12+15+17=44&gt;&gt;44 marbles in the bag.
The probability of drawing a non-red or non-blue marble is the number of non-red or non-blue marbles (44-12-15 = &lt;&lt;44-12-15=17&gt;&gt;17) divided by the total number of marbles (44).

            Continuing from the previous situation, suppose the factory decided to cut down its monthly goal and now aims to produce only 50 windows in a month. Based on this new target, how many windows does the factory need to produce each day if it still operates for 31 days in a month?

However, since the factory cannot produce a fraction of a window, we can say that the factory needs to produce at least 2 windows per day to meet its new goal.
### Answer: At least 2 windows per day 

(Note: The factory cannot produce a fraction of a window, so the actual number of windows produced per day will depend on the factory's production capacity and efficiency. The answer provided is the minimum number of windows that the factory needs to produce each day to meet its new goal.)</pre>

Cheese produced per day = Total cheese produced / Number of days

Since it is not possible to produce a fraction of a kilogram of cheese, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find out how many cucumbers one plant yields on average. We can do this by dividing the number of cucumbers by the number of plants: 2592/54 = &lt;&lt;2592/54=48&gt;&gt;48 cucumbers per plant.
Next, we need to find out how many cucumbers 38 plants yield: 38 \* 48 = &lt;&lt;38*48=1824&gt;&gt;1824 cucumbers.
Finally, we need to subtract the 74 damaged cucumbers from the total number of cucumbers: 1824 - 74 = &lt;&lt;1824-74=1750&gt;&gt;1750 cucumbers.

            A train travels at a speed of 68 mph but due to certain restrictions, it had to slow down to 28 mph. Considering the travel time of 21 hours, calculate the impact on the total distance traveled by the train.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how far the train traveled at each speed.
At 68 mph, the train would have traveled 68*T1 miles, where T1 is the time spent traveling at this speed.
At 28 mph, the train traveled 28*T2 miles, where T2 is the time spent traveling at this speed.
Since the total travel time is 21 hours, T1 + T2 = 21.
We don't have enough information to find T1 and T2 individually, but we can find the total distance traveled by the train.
The total distance is 68*T1 + 28*T2.
Since T1 + T2 = 21, we can write T1 as 21 - T2.
Substituting this into the equation for the total distance, we get 68*(21 - T2) + 28*T2.
Expanding and simplifying, we get 1427 - 40*T2.
Since we don't have enough information to find T2, we can't find the exact total distance, but we can express it as 1427 - 40*T2.
### Answer: The total distance traveled by the train is 1427 - 40*T2 miles, where T2 is the time spent traveling at 28 mph.</pre>

            A farmer starts the day with 18 tomatoes in his basket. By midday, he manages to harvest some more, bringing the total to 18 + 82 tomatoes in the basket. Unfortunately, 37 of these tomatoes are deemed unsellable because they are not ripe enough. How many tomatoes does the farmer have left in the basket that are ready to sell?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The farmer has 18 + 82 = &lt;&lt;18+82=100&gt;&gt;100 tomatoes in total after harvesting.
Of these, 37 are not ripe enough, so 100 - 37 = &lt;&lt;100-37=63&gt;&gt;63 tomatoes are ready to sell.
### Answer: 63 

(Note: The phrase &quot;18 + 82 tomatoes in the basket&quot; might be misleading, as it could be interpreted as 18 and 82 tomatoes together, rather than the sum of 18 and 82. However, I assumed it meant the sum, as that is the usual interpretation in mathematical contexts.)</pre>

Now, let's calculate the tax: $9.
Finally, let's calculate the total cost: $621 + $9 = $&lt;&lt;621+9=630&gt;&gt;630.

The store owner originally paid $630 for the 23 pairs of binoculars, so the total amount the store owner will need to pay now is $630 - $68 = $&lt;&lt;630-68=562&gt;&gt;562.

            A candlemaker has 37 lavender-scented candles and makes 10 more. He then makes another 24 candles, combines them with the ones he already has, and finally adds 6 vanilla-scented candles to his collection. How many candles does he have in total?

Then, he made 24 more candles, bringing his total to 47+24 = &lt;&lt;47+24=71&gt;&gt;71 candles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The beachcomber found 74 seashells per day for 42 days, which is 74*42 = &lt;&lt;74*42=3088&gt;&gt;3088 seashells.
Then, the beachcomber found an additional 56 seashells, so the total number of seashells is 3088+56 = &lt;&lt;3088+56=3144&gt;&gt;3144 seashells.
### Answer: 3144 seashells</pre>
