### Answer: 18,585 bottles 

In this case, the factory produces fewer bottles each day, so the weekly production is also less than before.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The factory produces 181 chips per hour and it works for 475 hours.
So, the factory would produce 181 \* 475 = &lt;&lt;181*475=85775&gt;&gt;85,775 chips in total.
### Answer: 85,775
