            Steve started with 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days. Then he received an extra 11 dollars. John started with 18 dollars but then he spent the same amount of money as Steve had. John found 25 dollars on the street. How much money does John have now?

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Steve spends 38/8 = $&lt;&lt;38/8=4.75&gt;&gt;4.75 per day.
Steve's spending for 8 days = 8 \* $4.75 = $&lt;&lt;8*4.75=38&gt;&gt;38.
Steve has $38 + $11 = $&lt;&lt;38+11=49&gt;&gt;49 after receiving the extra money.
John spends $38 in 8 days, so John spends $38 / 8 = $&lt;&lt;38/8=4.75&gt;&gt;4.75 per day.
John's spending for the same period = 8 \* $4.75 = $&lt;&lt;8*4.75=38&gt;&gt;38.
John has $38 - $38 + $25 = $&lt;&lt;38-38+25=25&gt;&gt;25 after finding the money on the street.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how much money John has in total, we need to add the amount of money in his bank account to the amount of loose change he found.

The loose change John found is $8/37, which is a little over $2 (since $8/37 â‰ˆ $2.16).

Therefore, John has $17 + $8/37 = $17 + $2.16 = $19.16 in total.

            A truck can travel a distance of 34/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel. If 11 more kilometers are added to its journey, what is the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel? Then, if an additional 49 kilometers are added to the journey, what would be the total distance then?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find out how many kilometers the truck can travel on a liter of fuel: 34/25 kilometers.

To find the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel when 11 more kilometers are added, we multiply the distance the truck can travel on a liter of fuel by the amount of fuel it has:

Let's assume the truck has 1 liter of fuel.

Distance it can travel = (34/25) \* 1 = 34/25 kilometers.

Total distance it can travel before running out of fuel = 34/25 + 11 = (34+275)/25 = 309/25 = 12.36 kilometers.

To find the total distance the truck can travel when 49 more kilometers are added, we need to find out how much fuel the truck needs to travel 49 kilometers:

Fuel needed = 49 / (34/25) = 49 \* 25 / 34 = 36.76 liters (approximately).

Total distance the truck can travel = 34/25 \* 36.76 + 49 = 36.76 \* 34/25 + 49 = 50.496 + 49 = 99.496 kilometers.

### Answer: The truck can travel 12.36 kilometers before running out of fuel when 11 more kilometers are added, and it can travel 99.496 kilometers when 49 more kilometers are added.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The supermarket is (25/41 - 17/3) miles closer to John's work than his house.
To find the distance between John's work and the supermarket, we need to find the difference between the distances from John's work to the supermarket and from John's work to his house.
To do this, we can convert 17/3 and 25/41 to a common denominator, which is 123.
17/3 becomes 122/123 and 25/41 becomes 75/123.

            Tom moved two rocks today. The first rock was moved for an interval of 20/50 hours, and the second was moved for an interval of 45/36 hours. If Tom can move rocks at a speed of 25/22 miles per hour, how far in miles did he move the rocks today?

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find out how long Tom moved each rock.
The first rock was moved for 20/50 = 2/5 hours and the second was moved for 45/36 = 5/4 hours.
Next, we need to find out how far Tom moved each rock.
Tom moves the first rock for 2/5 hours at a speed of 25/22 miles per hour, so he moves the first rock a distance of (2/5) x (25/22) = 1/2 miles.
Tom moves the second rock for 5/4 hours at a speed of 25/22 miles per hour, so he moves the second rock a distance of (5/4) x (25/22) = 625/176 â‰ˆ 3.53 miles.
Finally, we need to find out how far Tom moved the rocks altogether.
Tom moved the first rock 1/2 mile and the second rock 3.53 miles, so he moved the rocks a total distance of 1/2 + 3.53 = 3.73 miles.

            A scientist mixes 10/42 liters of solution A and 32 liters of solution B to create a mixture. She then removes 4/28 liters from this mixture. If she then decides to extract 11/29 of the remaining mixture for an experiment, how much solution is she using for her experiment?

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's simplify the fractions of the amounts removed:
4/28 = 1/7, and 11/29 cannot be simplified further.

Next, let's find the amount of solution left after removing 1/7 of the initial mixture:

The scientist starts with 10/42 + 32 = 134/42 liters of solution.
After removing 1/7 of this, she has 134/42 - (134/42)*(1/7) = 134/42 - 134/294 = 268/294 - 134/294 = 134/294 liters left.

Finally, let's find 11/29 of the remaining solution:

11/29 * 134/294 = 1474/8333 liters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find out how much juice Natalia has in total after mixing the two containers.
23/35 + 50/41 = (23*41 + 50*35)/(35*41) = 1443/1435
Then, we need to find out how much juice Natalia has left after the customer drank 11/19 gallon.
1443/1435 - 11/19 = (1443*19 - 11*1435)/(1435*19) = 1025/27265
Finally, we need to find out how much space is left in the bottle after subtracting 1025/27265 from 28.

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, convert all volumes to the same unit. Since the smallest unit used is a liter, convert ounces to liters (1 ounce is about 0.02957 liters). So, Richard drank 33*0.02957 = &lt;&lt;33*0.02957=0.975401&gt;&gt;0.975 liters of wine.
Then, add the volumes of orange juice and water: 26/30 + 2/36 = (26*12 + 2*10) / (30*12) = 314/360.
Finally, add the volume of wine to the sum of orange juice and water: 0.975 + 314/360 = (0.975*360 + 314) / 360 = 457.4/360.

            John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days. He began noticing that his apples lasts about as long as 48 ounces of apple juice, which he happens to consume every 42 days. Calculate the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to convert John's apple consumption from pounds to ounces, since apple juice is measured in ounces. We know that 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces.

So, John consumes 17 pounds * 16 ounces/pound = &lt;&lt;17*16=272&gt;&gt;272 ounces of apples every 8 days.

Now, we need to find out how many ounces of apples John consumes in 42 days, which is the same as the amount of time it takes him to consume 48 ounces of apple juice.

John consumes 272 ounces/8 days * 42 days = &lt;&lt;272*42/8=1512&gt;&gt;1512 ounces of apples in 42 days.

Therefore, the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption is 1512 ounces of apples to 48 ounces of apple juice, or 31.5 ounces of apples for every ounce of apple juice.
### Answer: 31.5 (ounces of apples per ounce of apple juice)</pre>

The amount of money Maria has left after the second trip is 38 dollars - 50/4 dollars = 38 dollars - &lt;&lt;50/4=12.5&gt;&gt;12.5 dollars = 25.5 dollars.
The summation of the total miles Maria drove and the remaining amount of money she had for gas is 45.71 miles + 25.5 dollars = &lt;&lt;45.71+25.5=71.21&gt;&gt;71.21.

            Susan has 48 dollars in her pocket. She goes to a store and buys a toy. The toy cost is 18 dollars plus 41/14 dollars for tax. How much money does she have left after buying the toy?

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy including tax.
The tax amount is 41/14 dollars, which is approximately 2.93 dollars.
The total cost of the toy is 18+2.93 = &lt;&lt;18+2.93=20.93&gt;&gt;20.93 dollars.
Susan had 48 dollars and spent 20.93 dollars, so she has 48-20.93 = &lt;&lt;48-20.93=27.07&gt;&gt;27.07 dollars left.

            You have 27/6 gallons of water in a tank. You then pour out 5/40 gallons of water from the tank. As you noticed the tank seems low, you add 21/26 gallons more. How many gallons of water are in the tank after all those actions?

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, pour out 5/40 gallons of water from 27/6 gallons.
27/6 - 5/40 = (27*10 - 5*3)/60 = 270 - 15/60 = 255/60 gallons
Then, add 21/26 gallons more.
255/60 + 21/26 = (255*26 + 21*60)/(60*26) = 6615 + 1260/1560 = 7875/1560 gallons
Simplify the fraction.
7875/1560 = 5*3*5*3*5*11/2^3*3*5*41 = 125*11/2^3*41 = 125*11/164 â‰ˆ 0.7675 gallons

            Your favorite juice shop buys oranges for $34 per 8 bags. They've found a new vendor offering the same quantity of oranges for $19 per 30 bags. How much less per bag does the new vendor charge?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find the price per bag for each vendor.
The juice shop's original vendor charges $34 for 8 bags, so the price per bag is $34/8 = $&lt;&lt;34/8=4.25&gt;&gt;4.25 per bag.
The new vendor charges $19 for 30 bags, so the price per bag is $19/30 = $&lt;&lt;19/30=0.6333333333333333&gt;&gt;0.63 (rounded to two decimal places) per bag.
To find the difference in price per bag, subtract the new vendor's price from the original vendor's price: $4.25 - $0.63 = $&lt;&lt;4.25-0.63=3.62&gt;&gt;3.62.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the distance covered by the train, we can use the formula:
Distance = Speed Ã— Time
In this case, the speed of the train is 39 kilometers per hour and the time is 5 hours.
So, the distance covered is:

### Answer: 80 kilometers 

Note: The distance covered by a moving object is directly proportional to its speed, assuming all other factors remain constant. So, if the speed of the train is reduced by half, the distance covered in the same amount of time will also be reduced by half.</pre>
