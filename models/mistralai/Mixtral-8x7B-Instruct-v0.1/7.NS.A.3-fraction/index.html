            Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find the initial amount of cucumbers Carla can grow per plant:
Initial amount = (22/3) x (22/19) = &lt;&lt;(22/3)*(22/19)=8.210526315789474&gt;&gt;8.21 cucumbers per plant.
Then, we need to find the adjusted amount of cucumbers Carla can grow per plant:
Adjusted amount = Initial amount x (23/17) = 8.21 x (23/17) = &lt;&lt;8.21*(23/17)=11.017647058823529&gt;&gt;11.02 cucumbers per plant (rounded to two decimal places).

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's simplify 19/4 kg to 4 3/4 kg and 30/9 kg to 10/3 kg (which simplifies to 3 1/3 kg).
Pierre has 4 3/4 - 7/25 = &lt;&lt;4+3/4-7/25=16/25+3/4=49/50&gt;&gt;49/50 kg left after eating 7/25 kg of grapes.

            King Arthur is calculating the costs for restoring his castle. The wall repairs cost 26/22 of his castle's annual budget. Meanwhile, the moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget. Finally, installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget. How much (expressed as a fraction of the castle's annual budget) has King Arthur spent on these projects in total?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 26/22, 4/29, and 11/3. The least common multiple of 22, 29, and 3 is 5922.

Now, convert each fraction to have this common denominator:

26/22 = 26 * 271 / 22 * 271 = 7046 / 5922

4/29 = 4 * 203 / 29 * 203 = 812 / 5922

11/3 = 11 * 1973 / 3 * 1973 = 21703 / 5922

Add the fractions: 7046 / 5922 + 812 / 5922 + 21703 / 5922 = 29561 / 5922

            A giraffe at the local zoo has a peculiar eating habit. When it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves, it eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day. If the zoo calculates the weekly feeding amount by multiplying the daily intake by itself (making the result &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;) and then multiplying that with the regular daily intake, how many pounds of acacia leaves should they prepare for the giraffe for a week? Calculate ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26))^2 * ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26)) and provide your answer.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find out how much more the giraffe eats when it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves:

(25 / 19) \* (30 / 26) = (25 \* 30) / (19 \* 26) = 750 / 514 â‰ˆ 1.459

This means that the giraffe eats 1.459 times more than its usual daily intake.

Now, we need to calculate the weekly feeding amount:

((25 / 19) \* (30 / 26))^2 \* ((25 / 19) \* (30 / 26)) = (750 / 514)^3 â‰ˆ 1.149^3 â‰ˆ 1.419

Finally, we need to multiply this value with the giraffe's usual daily intake:

1.419 \* (25 / 19) â‰ˆ 1.898 lbs

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total rate at which the two candles burn together, we need to add their individual rates.
The first candle burns at a rate of 6/4 inches per hour, which simplifies to 3/2 inches per hour.
The second candle burns at a rate of 14/16 inches per hour, which simplifies to 7/8 inches per hour.
Therefore, the total rate at which the two candles burn together is 3/2 + 7/8 = 21/8 = &lt;&lt;21/8=2.625&gt;&gt;2.625 inches per hour.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The chef uses 26/24 kg of sugar for one cake, which is equivalent to 1 kg of sugar (since 26/24 simplifies to 1, and 1*24/24 = 1).
After making one cake, the chef has 28 - 1 = &lt;&lt;28-1=27&gt;&gt;27 kg of sugar left.
Then, the chef adds 10/6 kg of sugar to their supply, which is equivalent to 1 + 10/6 = 16/6 = 8/3 kg (since 6*10/6 = 10, and 10 + 3 = 13, and 13/6 simplifies to 8/3).

The common denominator for these fractions is 12*29 = &lt;&lt;12*29=348&gt;&gt;348.
So, the fraction of the apple pie Princess Lily ate is (10/12)*(348/348) = 290/348 and the fraction of the blueberry pie she ate is (10/29)*(12/12) = 120/348.

To find out how much of the total food (chocolate cake and peach pie) she ate, we need to add these two fractions together.
The common denominator for these fractions is 1*29 = 29.
So, the fraction of the chocolate cake Princess Lily ate is (10/1)*(29/29) = 290/29 and the fraction of the peach pie she ate is (10/29)*(1/1) = 10/29.

            A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspectâ€™s involvement. Calculate the value of f.

            You have a paint mixing machine that creates specific shades of color.

The machine starts by mixing 24/8 gallons of red paint. It then pours away 12/8 gallons of the mix. Let 'd' represent the amount of red paint left in the machine.

Finally, the machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color, subtract that from 'd' to find 'x' in gallons, which is the total amount of paint. Find the value of 'x'.

            Let's suppose for a special recipe sandwich, you need to divide a wheel of cheese into 14 equal parts and a pickle jar into 18 equal parts. 

To make one special sandwich, you need 21 parts of the wheel of cheese and 7 parts from the pickle jar.

You've just made these sandwiches and you are down to ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of your original ingredients.

Later, you decided to make a simpler version of the sandwich which required half of the wheel of cheese and did not use any pickles.

What fraction of the original ingredients do you have left after making the simpler sandwich? Calculate the answer by subtracting (2 / 4) from the fraction you had after making the first sandwich.

For the simpler sandwich, you used half of the wheel of cheese, which is 1/2 \* 14/14 = 14/14 = 1.

Substituting n with 30/9, we get d = 30/9 - 17/22.
To solve for d, we need to find a common denominator for 9 and 22, which is 198.
Multiplying both the numerator and denominator of 30/9 by 22, we get 660/198.
Multiplying both the numerator and denominator of 17/22 by 9, we get 153/198.
Subtracting 153/198 from 660/198, we get 507/198 ounces.

Calculate the total amount of cheese in ounces that Jeremy will have to use if he uses 'd' ounces of cheese from what he received for each sandwich. Use the formula 'k = (30 / 18) * d' to find your answer.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total amount of cheese Jeremy will have to use for each sandwich, we can use the formula k = (30 / 18) \* d, where d is the amount of cheese Jeremy actually received, which is 507/198 ounces.
Substituting d with 507/198, we get k = (30 / 18) \* 507/198.
To solve for k, we need to find a common denominator for 18 and 198, which is 198.
Multiplying both the numerator and denominator of 30/18 by 11, we get 330/198.
Multiplying both the numerator and denominator of 507/198 by 1, we get 507/198.
Multiplying 330/198 by 507/198, we get 167160/38868 ounces.

            Based on the previous problem, suppose now that when Jeremy weighed his cheese, he found that there was actually 20/22 ounces less cheese than he requested, instead of 17/22 ounces. With this change, calculate how much cheese he actually received now. Use the equation 'd = n - (20 / 22)' to find the answer.

Substituting n with 30/9, we get d = 30/9 - 20/22.
To solve for d, we need to find a common denominator for 9 and 22, which is 198.
Multiplying both the numerator and denominator of 30/9 by 22, we get 660/198.
Multiplying both the numerator and denominator of 20/22 by 9, we get 180/198.
Subtracting 180/198 from 660/198, we get 480/198 ounces.

In the first test, she found that 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays completely, while in the second test, 20 out of every 18 sunglasses also blocked all UV rays.

Sophia decided to add these numbers to her total. Next, she added the additional 21 out of 17 sunglasses from another batch that also blocked all UV rays.

Later, she realized she made a mistake and needed to subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that actually did not block all UV rays.

While preparing the sandwiches, Shawn realizes that he has to add 18/12 cups of cheese spread to his recipe. Calculate the total amount of ingredients Shawn now needs to make one sandwich which includes mayonnaise, sandwich spread, and cheese spread. 

Finally, if Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, how many cups of ingredients will he use in total to make those sandwiches?

            The jeweler decided to use a more expensive gold making process for his rings, which requires a slightly larger amount of gold, specifically 21/28 of a kilogram instead of the original 14/28. Taking this into account, now how much total weight of gold and silver is he using to craft his rings?

            In a beehive, there are sections for honey storage and bee rearing. Each section is classified into many sub-sections. One day, the beekeeper discovered that each honey storage sub-section had (25 / 9) gallons of honey. He also found the same amount of honey in each bee rearing sub-section. 

If he combined the honey from both a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the beekeeper would have a total quantity represented by 'p'. 

However, one honey storage sub-section had an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey. So, if the beekeeper was calculating the total amount from this sub-section plus a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be defined as 's'. 

What quantity of honey ('s') would the beekeeper have in total from this scenario?

Converting both fractions to have a common denominator of 234 (the least common multiple of 9 and 26):

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for all the fractions. In this case, the least common multiple of 6, 18, and 22 is 396.

The bear ate 28 * (396/6) = &lt;&lt;28*(396/6)=1428&gt;&gt;1428/396 pounds of fish on the first day.
The bear ate 21 * (396/18) = &lt;&lt;21*(396/18)=462&gt;&gt;462/396 pounds of fish on the second day.
The bear ate 24 * (396/22) = &lt;&lt;24*(396/22)=414&gt;&gt;414/396 pounds of fish on the third day.

Adding these together, the bear ate 1428/396 + 462/396 + 414/396 = (1428 + 462 + 414) / 396 = 2304 / 396 pounds of fish in these three days.

On the other hand, the royal baker needs 26/20 gallons of milk for each of the cakes he's baking.

Calculate the total amount of liquid (v) that will be consumed if the baker's requirement is multiplied by the guests' consumption (i), and then add this to the guests' consumption (v) to find the total amount of liquid (x) needed for the feast.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the amount of liquid (v) consumed by the guests and the baker separately.

Guests' consumption (v) = Water (15/7 gallons) + Wine (15/24 gallons)
= (15/7 + 15/24) gallons
= (120 + 35)/168 gallons
= 155/168 gallons

Baker's requirement (v) = Milk (26/20 gallons)
= (26/20) gallons

Now, we need to multiply the baker's requirement by the guests' consumption to get the total amount of liquid (v).

v = (155/168) * (26/20) gallons
= (155 * 26) / (168 * 20) gallons
= 4030 / 3360 gallons

Finally, we need to add the guests' consumption (v) to the total amount of liquid (v) to get the total amount of liquid (x) needed for the feast.

x = v + v
= (4030 / 3360) + (155 / 168) gallons
= (4030 + 155 * 20) / 3360 gallons
= 5130 / 3360 gallons

            Jake is trying to figure out how many grapes he can get from a certain vineyard. 

- The vineyard can usually produce 19/2 baskets of grapes every season. However, due to weather conditions, only 19/29 of the usual amount were produced this season. How many baskets of grapes were produced this season?

- But Jake isn't the only one interested in these grapes. He has to share the grapes with others. He gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes. How many baskets of grapes does he get?

- Out of the grapes that he got, Jake wants to make some grape juice. But he only uses 9/10 of his grapes to make the juice. How many baskets of grapes does he use for the juice?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning for part 1: The vineyard usually produces 19/2 baskets of grapes every season. This season, only 19/2 * (19/29) = &lt;&lt;19/2*19/29=19^2/2*29=361/58=6+1/58=6.01724137931&gt;&gt;6.02 baskets of grapes were produced.

Reasoning for part 2: Jake gets to keep 7/11 of the total amount of grapes. So, he gets 6.02 * (7/11) = &lt;&lt;6.02*7/11=42.14/11=3.83090909091&gt;&gt;3.83 baskets of grapes.

Reasoning for part 3: Jake uses 9/10 of his grapes to make the juice. So, he uses 3.83 * (9/10) = &lt;&lt;3.83*9/10=34.47/10=3.447&gt;&gt;3.45 baskets of grapes for the juice.

            A snowman is constructed by stacking two different sized snowballs on top of each other. The larger snowball at the bottom has a diameter of 17/8 feet, and the smaller snowball on top has a diameter of 1/20 feet. What is the total height of the snowman in feet when these two snowballs are stacked on top of each other?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The radius of the larger snowball is 17/16 feet (half of its diameter), and the radius of the smaller snowball is 1/40 feet (half of its diameter).
The height of the larger snowball is its diameter times its radius, which is 17/8 feet times 17/16 feet = 289/128 feet.
The height of the smaller snowball is its diameter times its radius, which is 1/20 feet times 1/40 feet = 1/8000 feet.
The total height of the snowman is the sum of the heights of the two snowballs, which is 289/128 feet + 1/8000 feet = 224227/1000000 feet.

The lion ate 23/9 of a wildebeest the next day.
To find the difference, subtract the fractions: 14/13 - 23/9.
To do this, find a common denominator, which is 117.
Then, subtract the numerators: 14 - 69 = -55.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the expected number of bananas produced by the two species together on a random day, we need to calculate the probability of each species producing bananas on that day and then add those probabilities together.

The probability of the first species producing bananas on a random day is 12/29 because there are 12 bananas produced in 29 days.

The probability of the second species producing bananas on a random day is 30/10 = 3 because there are 30 bananas produced in 10 days.

Using the formula ((12 / 29) + (30 / 10)), we get:

(12/29) + 3 = (12/29) + (3 * 29/10) = (12/29) + (87/10) = (12 + 261)/29 = 273/29

            Teddy, the bear, loves to play hide and seek with his friends. One day, he decided to play a game where he hides some number of his stuffed animal friends. Teddy hides 18/11 of his friends in the forest and 8/21 of his friends at the beach. First calculate how many more friends Teddy hides in the forest than at the beach. Let's call this number 'f'. Then square 'f' to find 'n', the total number of hiding spots Teddy needs. How many hiding spots does Teddy need?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find out how many more friends Teddy hides in the forest than at the beach:
18/11 - 8/21 = (18*21 - 8*11)/(11*21) = 378/231 = 18/11
So, Teddy hides the same number of friends in the forest and at the beach. Therefore, 'f' is 0, and 'n', the total number of hiding spots Teddy needs, is f^2 = 0^2 = 0.

            During rainy weather, a small snail moves at a snail-pace covering 17/21 of a meter in an hour. Another slightly faster snail covers 20/24 of a meter in the same time during such weather. 

One rainy day, the first snail started an hour earlier than the second. At the time when the second snail began, a third snail that covers 18/17 of a meter per hour also started moving. 

What is their total distance in meters 1 hour after all three have started moving? Compute the result using the operation ((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) for the first two snails' distance, and multiply this result by (18 / 17) for the total distance , including the third snail.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The monkey ate (22/7) * (10/25) = (22*10)/(7*25) = (2*10)/(1*5) = 20/5 = &lt;&lt;(22/7)*(10/25)=(2*10)/(1*5)=20/5=4&gt;&gt;4 bananas.
The monkey gave (3/28) of the pile to his friend, which is 3/28 \* x, where x is the whole pile.
Since the monkey had 4 bananas left, we can write the equation: x - 3/28 \* x = 4.
Solving for x, we get x = 4 / (1 - 3/28) = 4 / (25/28) = 4 \* (28/25) = 4 \* 1.12 = &lt;&lt;4*(28/25)=4*1.12=4.48&gt;&gt;4.48 bananas.

            Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements. 

What does Captain Alfâ€™s final calculation come to? Use these steps and corresponding fractions to find your answer.

Later, he bought 27 more shirts but wanted to sell them at a higher price, so he decided to keep only 1/19 of those shirts for each sibling. How many more or fewer shirts does each sibling now have as compared to before? Calculate the difference using the expression ((18 / 3) - (27 / 19)) and find out the result.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find out how many shirts each sibling got initially. 18 shirts divided equally among 3 siblings is (18 / 3) = 6 shirts per sibling.
Then, we need to find out how many shirts each sibling would get from the 27 new shirts. That would be (27 / 19) = 1.42 shirts per sibling.
Since Lucas decided to keep only 1 shirt for each sibling from the 27 new shirts, each sibling now has (6 - 1) = 5 shirts.
The difference in the number of shirts each sibling has now compared to before is ((18 / 3) - (27 / 19)) = (6 - 1.42) = 4.58 shirts.

            A lamp store owner is doing inventory of all the lamps in his store. He found that he has 4/26 of lamps that are floor lamps, 15/11 that are desk lamps, he also discovered he has 23/28 of table lamps and finally 8/19 of lamps that are decorative. What fraction of his total inventory do these lamps constitute?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To find the total fraction of lamps that constitute the inventory, we need to add the fractions of floor lamps, desk lamps, table lamps, and decorative lamps.

First, we need to get a common denominator for all the fractions. The least common multiple of 26, 11, 28, and 19 is 1288.

So, we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 1288:

Floor lamps: 4/26 = (4 \* 49) / (26 \* 49) = 196 / 1274
Desk lamps: 15/11 = (15 \* 116) / (11 \* 116) = 1740 / 1274
Table lamps: 23/28 = (23 \* 46) / (28 \* 46) = 1058 / 1274
Decorative lamps: 8/19 = (8 \* 68) / (19 \* 68) = 544 / 1274

Now, we add the fractions:

Total = 196/1274 + 1740/1274 + 1058/1274 + 544/1274 = 4538/1274

So, the total fraction of the inventory is 4538/1274 or 2.07 (rounded to two decimal places).

However, this fraction is greater than 1, which means that the fractions are overlapping and represent more than 100% of the inventory. This is not possible, as the fractions should add up to 100%. It seems that there is an error in the given data, as the fractions cannot be added directly to find the total fraction of the inventory.

### Answer: The given data is inconsistent and cannot be used to determine the total fraction of the inventory.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total number of batches of towels Joanna washed, we need to calculate the number of batches she washed for each size of towel separately, then add those numbers together.

First, let's find the number of batches of small towels Joanna washed: 24/20 = 1.2 batches per cycle, but Joanna can only wash whole batches, so she washed 1 batch of small towels.

Next, let's find the number of batches of large towels Joanna washed: 25/15 = 1.67 batches per cycle, but Joanna can only wash whole batches, so she washed 2 batches of large towels.

Now, let's add the number of batches of small towels and large towels Joanna washed: 1 + 2 = &lt;&lt;1+2=3&gt;&gt;3 batches.

            Debra is baking cookies and she realizes she has two different recipes for the same type of cookie. She's wondering if she combines the ingredients from both, if she will end up with even more cookies or not. 

The first recipe requires (27 / 3) cups flour and (11 / 7) cups sugar. She determines the ratio of flour to sugar by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar. She then subtracts (21 / 26) from this ratio because that's how many cups of sugar her friend says makes the cookies too sweet. After that, she adds (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio to see how many total cups of flour she will need. How many cups of flour will she have in the end?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find the new ratio of flour to sugar after subtracting (21/26) from the first recipe's ratio:

The first recipe's ratio is (27/3) / (11/7) = 63/11

Subtracting (21/26) from this ratio gives us: (63/11) - (21/26) = (126-21)/22 = 105/22

Now, add (22/9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio:

(105/22) + (22/9) = (105*9 + 22*48) / 198 = 1407/198

So, Debra will have (1407/198) cups of flour in the end.

            Professor Astro is working on his telescope. He believes the power of his telescope is directly proportional to the sum of two fractions. The first fraction is the light gathering power of the lens, which is 24 out of 27. The second fraction is the zooming potential, which is 30 out of 26.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> First, we need to convert the fractions to a common denominator, which is 27 * 26 = 702.

The first fraction becomes: 24 / 27 = 24 * (26 / 27) = 24 * 26 / 27 = 624 / 27.

The second fraction becomes: 30 / 26 = 30 * (27 / 26) = 30 * 27 / 26 = 810 / 26.

Now, we can add the two fractions: (624 / 27) + (810 / 26) = 624 * 26 / (27 * 26) + 810 * 27 / (26 * 27) = 16224 / 702 + 21870 / 702.

The sum of these fractions is: 16224 / 702 + 21870 / 702 = (16224 + 21870) / 702 = 38094 / 702.

### Answer: Professor Astro finds that the sum of the two fractions is 38094 / 702.</pre>

            Jaden is a dairy farmer who milks his cows twice a day. In the morning, his cows give him 26/14 gallons of milk per cow, and in the evening, they give 28/20 gallons of milk per cow. If he multiplies these two fractions together, how much milk is he getting from one cow in one day?

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Following the previous problem, let's consider that Jaden has made some changes on his farm that affected the milk production in the evening. Now, his cows give him 28/10 gallons of milk per cow in the evening instead of the previous 28/20 gallons. If we still take the morning milk production as 26/14 gallons per cow, how much milk is he getting from one cow in one day now?
