            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve for the variable u, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
First, subtract 92 from both sides of the equation:
122 - 92 = 28 * u
30 = 28 * u
Next, divide both sides of the equation by 28:
30 / 28 = (28 * u) / 28
30 / 28 = u

First, subtract 56 from both sides of the equation:

Then, to solve for j, we divide both sides by 42:
j = 53 / 42
j = 1.2619047619047618

However, since j is a whole number, it's possible that the equation is incorrect or that we need to round the answer. If we round j to the nearest whole number, we get:
j = 1

But to make the equation true, j must be:
j = 1 + 12/42
j = 1 + 1/3.5
j = 1 + 0.2857142857142857

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To find the value of w, first subtract 35 from both sides of the equation:

80 - 35 = 24w
45 = 24w

Then divide both sides by 24:

w = 45 / 24
w = 1.54166666667

Since w is a whole number of clips, it must be that w is an approximation of the actual value. The original equation can be satisfied by any integer value of w that is greater than or equal to 1.54166666667 rounded to the nearest whole number, which is 2.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To isolate x, we first need to get rid of the innermost parentheses. We do this by multiplying 14 and x:

14 * x = 14x

Then, we add 33 to 14x:

33 + 14x

Now, we have the equation:

77 = 33 + 14x

To solve for x, we first subtract 33 from both sides:

77 - 33 = 33 + 14x - 33

This simplifies to:

44 = 14x

Finally, we divide both sides by 14 to solve for x:

x = 44 / 14

Simplifying this fraction gives us:

x = 11/2

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To solve the equation for u, we first want to isolate u on one side of the equation. We can do this by following the order of operations and working backwards from the given equation.

Given: 12 = 63 - 50 * u

To isolate u, we need to undo the multiplication of 50 and u. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 50:

12 / 50 = (63 - 50 * u) / 50

Now, we can simplify the equation:

0.24 = 63 / 50 - u

Next, we need to undo the subtraction of u. To do this, we add u to both sides of the equation:

u = 0.24 + u

Finally, we need to undo the addition of u. To do this, we subtract u from both sides of the equation:

u = 0.24 - 0.24

Simplifying, we get:

u = 0

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to follow the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right). This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.

So, we first solve the expression in the innermost parentheses: 30 * g
Then, we add 22 to the result of that multiplication.
Finally, we check if the result is equal to 65. If not, we solve for g.

65 = 22 + (30 * g)

First, subtract 22 from both sides:

65 - 22 = 30 * g

43 = 30 * g

Now, divide both sides by 30:

43 / 30 = g

g â‰ˆ 1.43

However, g is not a decimal in this context. It is likely that there is a mistake in the problem, and it is impossible to find an exact solution for g with whole numbers. But, if we round g to the nearest whole number, we get:

g = 1

And we can check if this is a valid solution:

65 = 22 + (30 * 1)

65 = 22 + 30

65 = 52

Since this is not true, there is no exact solution for g with whole numbers.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve for y, we need to isolate y on one side of the equation. We can do this by following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) in reverse.

First, subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

93 - 33*y - 40 = 93 - 40
53 - 33*y = 53

Next, subtract 53 from both sides of the equation:

53 - 33*y - 53 = 53 - 53
-33*y = 0

Finally, divide both sides of the equation by -33:

(-33*y)/-33 = 0/-33
y = 0

74 = 48u - 20

Next, we will add 20 to both sides to isolate the term with u on one side of the equation.

74 + 20 = 48u

94 = 48u

Finally, we will divide both sides by 48 to solve for u.

94 / 48 = (48u) / 48

94 / 48 = u

93 - 2 = (19 * r) + 2 - 2
91 = 19 * r

Next, we can solve for r by dividing both sides of the equation by 19:

91 / 19 = (19 * r) / 19

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

So, we first solve the expression in the innermost parentheses: 39 \* x.

Then, we add the result to 54.

Finally, we check if the result is equal to 111. If not, we adjust x until it does.

39 \* x = y (let's call the result y for now)

54 + y = 111

y = 111 - 54

y = 57

So, 39 \* x = 57

x = 57 / 39

x = 1.46153846154 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

However, since x has to be a whole number of clips Natalia sold, we need to round it to the nearest whole number. Since 1.46 is closer to 1 than to 2, we round down to x = 1.

            Solve the following equation for the variable a: 

179 = ((63 * a) + 93)

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To solve for the variable a, we first need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by following these steps:

1. Subtract 93 from both sides of the equation: 179 - 93 = 86, so 86 = 63 * a
2. Divide both sides by 63: 86 / 63 = (63 * a) / 63, so 86/63 = a

However, 86/63 is an improper fraction, so we should simplify it to a mixed number: 86/63 = 1 23/63.

### Answer: a = 1 23/63 or a = 1.36507936508 (rounded to 11 decimal places)</pre>

First, add 11 to both sides of the equation:

62 = 27 * c

Next, divide both sides by 27:

62 / 27 = (27 * c) / 27
