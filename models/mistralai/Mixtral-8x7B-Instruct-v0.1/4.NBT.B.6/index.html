            A pizza store has 975 slices of pizza ready to serve. If each pizza box can contain 196 slices, how many left over slices will there be after all the pizza boxes are full?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many boxes are needed to pack 975 slices, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per box:

975 / 196 = 5

This means that 5 boxes are needed to pack 975 slices. However, 975 is not a multiple of 196, so there will be some leftover slices. To find out how many, we subtract the number of slices that fit in the boxes from the total number of slices:

975 - (5 * 196) = 975 - 980 = -5

Since the number of leftover slices is negative, it means that there are not enough slices to fill the last box. Therefore, the number of leftover slices is:

196 - 20 = 176

### Answer: There will be 176 leftover slices after all the pizza boxes are full.</pre>

To do this, we can divide the total number of tigers by the number of zones: 740 tigers / 11 zones (since 740/696=11 with a remainder).
740/11 = &lt;&lt;740/11=67.27272727272727&gt;&gt;67 tigers and a remainder of 7.

Since they can't distribute the viewing evenings unevenly, they will round up to 4 nights.

            A total of 941 flies are jumping around the pond. Every time a frog jumps, it eats exactly 258 flies. After a series of jumps where each jump the frog eats the same number of flies, how many flies are left?

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: If the frog eats 258 flies with each jump, then after eating all the flies, there will be 941 - 258\*k flies left, where k is the number of jumps.
Since the frog eats all the flies, we have 258\*k = 941.
Solving for k, we get k = 941 / 258 â‰ˆ 3.64.
Since the number of jumps must be a whole number, the closest whole number value for k is 4.
So, after 4 jumps, the frog will have eaten 258\*4 = &lt;&lt;258*4=1032&gt;&gt;1032 flies, which is more than the total number of flies present.
This means that there are no flies left after the frog jumps 4 times.

            A construction company is installing 166 windows on a building. They have determined that one installation team can install 137 windows per day. If all windows are equally distributed amongst teams each day, how many windows will remain for the team to install on the next day?

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: If the installation team works on installing all 166 windows, then the number of windows remaining for the next day will be 166 - 137 = &lt;&lt;166-137=29&gt;&gt;29 windows.
### Answer: 29 

(Note: The phrasing of the question implies that the work will be evenly distributed, but I assumed that the team will work on all the windows and leave some for the next day. If the team is to install a fixed number of windows per day, please let me know the exact number and I can adjust my answer accordingly.)</pre>

            There are 999 seashells collected from a beach. They are grouped in beach-themed souvenir sets, each containing 474 shells. After grouping, how many seashells will be left without a set?

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Since 999 is not a multiple of 474, there will be some seashells left over after grouping them into sets of 474. To find out how many, we can divide the total number of seashells by the number of seashells in each set and see how much is left:
999 / 474 = 2 remainder 45
So, there will be 45 seashells left over after grouping them into 2 full sets.
### Answer: 45 

(Note: The number of full sets is 999 / 474 = 2, and the remainder 45 represents the number of seashells that do not form a full set.)</pre>

At the end of the day, there is 506-385 = &lt;&lt;506-385=121&gt;&gt;121 units of power left over.
### Answer: 121

            Following the scenario of the windmill and the small village, let's now consider that the windmill had a great day and managed to generate 506 units of power. However, due to development demands, the daily consumption of the village has increased to 920 units. At the end of the day, with the power being consumed in complete units, how much power is left over?

At the end of the day, there is 506-920 = &lt;&lt;506-920=-414&gt;&gt;-414 units of power left over.
However, negative power is not possible, so the windmill did not generate enough power for the village's increased consumption.
### Answer: -414 (but note that the actual answer is 0, as the windmill cannot generate a negative amount of power)</pre>

Since the remaining 86 students can't fill another bus by themselves, they will be spread out among the first three buses, leaving the last bus with only 144 - 86 = &lt;&lt;144-86=58&gt;&gt;58 students.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The doll seller was able to fill up the rows completely, since 603 is not a multiple of 369, there will be some dolls left unarranged.
To find out how many dolls are left, we subtract the number of dolls that can be arranged in complete rows from the total number of dolls.
603 - (603 // 369 \* 369) = 603 - 369 = &lt;&lt;603-(603-369*1)/369*369=33&gt;&gt;33

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: If every 44 steps leads to a significant place or clue, then the number of steps taken to reach the last significant place or clue will be a multiple of 44.
236 is not a multiple of 44, so the next multiple of 44 after 236 is 240.
The number of steps taken to reach the last significant place or clue is 240-236 = &lt;&lt;240-236=4&gt;&gt;4 steps.
### Answer: 4 

(Note: The actual number of steps left over will depend on where you are in relation to the next significant place or clue when you finish the 236th step. If you are already at a significant place or clue, then there will be no steps left over. If you are not at a significant place or clue, then there will be some number of steps between 1 and 44 left over. The problem only asks for the number of steps &quot;after&quot; the last significant place or clue, so the answer is 4.)</pre>

Since there are 3 complete sets of 230 sandcastles, and 1 set has 230 - 9 = &lt;&lt;230-9=221&gt;&gt;221 sandcastles, there are 684 - 3 \* 230 = &lt;&lt;684-(3*230)=156&gt;&gt;156 sandcastles left.

To find the number of toy cars left over, we need to divide the total number of toy cars by the number of toy cars in each pack and find the remainder.
735 / 348 = 2 remainder 95.
So, 95 toy cars will be left over after all full packs have been filled.

Since the last territory isn't fully occupied, it means that the remaining animals are less than 95.
### Answer: 36 
(Because 4 * 95 = 380, and 386 - 380 = 6, but since the territories are not fully occupied, we subtract 1 animal from the last territory for each of the 3 territories that are not full, which is 3 * 1 = 3, so 6 - 3 = 3 animals remain in the last territory.)</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: If the rope can be cut into x pieces of 902 meters each, then the length of the rope would be 902x meters. We need to find the value of x and the length of the remaining piece.

The length of the rope is 934 meters, so we have 934 = 902x + r, where r is the length of the remaining piece.

We can find x by dividing 934 by 902: x = 934/902 = 1.035453...
Since the number of pieces must be a whole number, we can see that x = 1, and there is one piece of 902 meters.

The remaining piece of the rope is 934 - 902 = &lt;&lt;934-902=32&gt;&gt;32 meters.

Since the number of pieces must be a whole number, it means that the manufacturer cannot cut the rope into pieces of 902 meters.

Therefore, the manufacturer cannot cut the rope into pieces of 902 meters, and the length of the piece of the rope would remain 202 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many calls each operator handles, we divide the total number of calls by the number of operators: 927 / 311 = &lt;&lt;927/311=2.98&gt;&gt;2.98 calls per operator.
Since the number of calls must be a whole number, we round this up to 3 calls per operator.
Then, to find out how many calls the last operator will handle, we subtract the number of calls that the other 310 operators can handle from the total number of calls: 927 - (310 \* 3) = 927 - 930 = -3.
Since the number of calls cannot be negative, this means that the last operator will not have to handle any calls.

            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many boxes are left unloaded, we need to find out how many boxes can be loaded into the trucks first.
Number of boxes that can be loaded = 274 / 4 = &lt;&lt;274/4=68.5&gt;&gt;68.5
Since a truck cannot carry half a box, only 68 trucks can be filled completely, leaving 274 - (68 x 4) = 274 - 272 = &lt;&lt;274-272=2&gt;&gt;2 boxes unloaded.
### Answer: 2 

(Note: The number of boxes that can be loaded is 68 full trucks, not 69, because 69 trucks would mean loading 276 boxes, which is more than the 274 boxes available.)</pre>

Since 1 box can hold 828 shirts, and we have only 0.311 boxes worth of shirts, we multiply the number of shirts per box by the decimal part of the quotient: 828 \* 0.311 = &lt;&lt;828*0.311=258.288&gt;&gt;258.288.

            A tailor has 925 meters of fabric. The tailor uses 529 meters of fabric to make each dress. If the tailor uses the fabric evenly for each dress, how many meters of fabric will be left over after completing the dresses?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Mixtral 8x7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The tailor uses 529 meters of fabric for each dress, so the amount of fabric left over is the total amount of fabric minus the amount used for the dresses.
To find out how many dresses the tailor can make, we divide the total amount of fabric by the amount used for each dress: 925/529 = 1 remainder 396.
So, the tailor can make 1 dress and will have 925-529 = &lt;&lt;925-529=396&gt;&gt;396 meters of fabric left over.
### Answer: 396 

(Note: The word &quot;evenly&quot; in the problem implies that the fabric will be used up completely for each dress, but this is not possible since 925 is not a multiple of 529. Therefore, there will be some fabric left over after making the dresses.)</pre>
