            Susan has a recipe that calls for 30 parts of flour to 27 parts of water. If she decides to use 29 parts of flour instead, and she keeps the water proportion the same, how much water will she use? Calculate this using fraction multiplication: ((30 / 30) * (29 / 27)).

So, the new proportion is (30/30) \* (29/27).

### Answer: (23/4) \* ((30/30) \* (29/27)) = 23/4 \* 29/27 = 203/108

### Answer: (5/2) \* (29/27) = 145/135

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. So we want to find 25/4 * 6/16.
First, we can simplify 25/4 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1: 25/4 stays the same.
Next, we can simplify 6/16 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: 6/16 simplifies to 3/8.
So we want to find 25/4 * 3/8.
The greatest common divisor of 25 and 3 is 1, so we can't simplify further.
To multiply the fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately: 25*3 = 75 and 4*8 = 32.
So 25/4 * 3/8 = 75/32.

First, we can simplify 19/6 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3: 19/6 simplifies to 19/3.
To multiply the fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately: 75*19 = 1425 and 32*3 = 96.
So 75/32 * 19/3 = 1425/96.

To simplify the fraction 26/6, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

So, the simplified fraction is 13/3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We first calculate the product of 5/27 and 15/2, which is 25/18 (as shown in the previous question).
Then, we multiply this fraction by itself:
(25/18) \* (25/18) = (25 \* 25) / (18 \* 18) = 625 / 324.
To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.
625 / 3 = 208.333... and 324 / 3 = 108.
### Answer: 208.333.../108 or 208/108 when written in mixed number form, which simplifies to 5/3.
(The fraction 208/108 cannot be simplified further, but it can be written as a mixed number 5 1/3, where 1/3 is a repeating decimal.)</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately:
(9 * 25) / (7 * 30) = 225 / 210.
To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 45:
225 / 45 = 5 and 210 / 45 = 4.5 (which is already in simplest form).
So, the simplified fraction is 5/4.5 or 5 * (2/3) = 10/3.

Multiplying this product by 25/4 gives (242/133)*(25/4) = 242*25/133*4 = 6050/532.

            Previously, you computed the result of (23/10) multiplied by (9/1). Now, consider what would have happened if instead of (9/1), you had (9/6). Multiply (23/10) by this new fraction. What is your answer?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To multiply fractions, you multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
(23/10) * (9/6) = (23 * 9) / (10 * 6) = 207 / 60 = 3.45
### Answer: 3.45 

Note: The answer is different because the denominator of the second fraction is now 6 instead of 1, which changes the result of the multiplication.</pre>

            Jim is baking a cake that calls for 12/2 cups of sugar and 17/14 cups of flour. If Jim needs to multiply the amount of sugar and flour he needs for a larger cake, how much sugar and flour does he need in total? Calculate ((12 / 2) * (17 / 14)) and express your answer as a simplified fraction.

Then, we multiply the simplified sugar and flour measurements: 6 * (17/14) = (6 * 17) / 14 = 102 / 14 = 51 / 7.

The GCD of 11 and 20 is 1, so (11/20) remains unchanged. The GCD of 24 and 12 is 12, so (24/12) simplifies to (2/1).
Then, we multiply the simplified fractions: (11/20) * (2/1) = (11*2)/(20*1) = 22/20.

            Following the previous problem, consider that you got an answer x from calculating (20 / 10) * (10 / 1). Now, evaluate z by multiplying your previous answer x with the fraction (19 / 15). Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

To write the answer as a simplified fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 380 and 15. The GCD of 380 and 15 is 5.
So, 380 / 15 = (380 / 5) / (15 / 5) = 76 / 3 = 25.333...

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the product of two fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
(25/20) * (11/6) = (25*11)/(20*6) = 275/120

The fraction 275/120 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.

275 Ã· 5 = 55
120 Ã· 5 = 24

So, the simplified fraction is 55/24.

(55/24) \* (20/26) = (55*20)/(24*26) = 1100/624

The fraction 1100/624 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8.

1100 Ã· 8 = 137.5
624 Ã· 8 = 78

So, the simplified fraction is 137.5/78, which can be simplified further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

137.5 Ã· 2 = 68.75
78 Ã· 2 = 39

So, the final simplified fraction is 68.75/39, which cannot be simplified further as it is a rational number.

            In the previous problem, you calculated the multiplication of the fractions 15/16 and 29/27. Now, let's imagine that you initially had a fraction with 15 as the numerator and 10 as the denominator instead of 15/16. How would the result differ if you multiply 15/10 by 29/27? Give your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To multiply two fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. Then, simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
15/10 \* 29/27 = (15 \* 29) / (10 \* 27) = 435 / 270
The fraction 435/270 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 45.

            Now, modify the previous problem by changing the numerator of the first fraction. Instead of following the first procedure using (16 / 16), consider what would happen if we used (16 / 12) instead. Solve (16 / 12) * (26 / 22) and write the result as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we simplify the fraction (16 / 12) to 4 / 3 (the greatest common divisor of 16 and 12 is 4, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4).
Then, we multiply the simplified fraction by (26 / 22).
(4 * 26) / (3 * 22) = 104 / 66.
Finally, we simplify the fraction 104 / 66 to 52 / 33.
### Answer: 52 / 33
