        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To compare the values of the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator and then compare the numerators.
The least common multiple of 9 and 10 is 90, so we convert both fractions to have this common denominator:
(10/9) = (10*10)/90 = 100/90
(5/10) = (5*9)/90 = 45/90
Comparing the numerators, 100 &gt; 45, so (10/9) &gt; (5/10).

First, let's get rid of the fractions by finding a common multiple of the denominators (1 and 9) and converting both fractions to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 1 and 9 is 9.

(3 / 1) = (3 \* 9) / (1 \* 9) = 27 / 9

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To compare the fractions (3 / 1) and (5 / 5), we need to find which one is greater or if they are equal.

First, let's get rid of the fractions by looking at the numerators and denominators. Both fractions have the same numerator and the same denominator, which means they are equal.

Therefore, (3 / 1) = (5 / 5).

### Answer:  

&lt; (9 / 6)

Reasoning: When comparing fractions, we can find a common denominator and then compare the numerators. The least common multiple of 9 and 6 is 18. So, we get 7/9 = 14/18 and 9/6 = 15/18. Since 14 &lt; 15, we have 7/9 &lt; 9/6.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> (2 / 7) &lt; (2 / 9)

Reasoning: To compare the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 63 in this case.
Then, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator: 2/7 becomes (2*9)/63 = 18/63 and 2/9 becomes (2*7)/63 = 14/63.
Since 18/63 is greater than 14/63, (2 / 7) is greater than (2 / 9). But the question asks for the opposite relation, so I wrote (2 / 7) &lt; (2 / 9).</pre>

Reasoning: To compare the fractions (9 / 4) and (7 / 1), we need to get them to have the same denominator. The least common denominator of 4 and 1 is 4, so we convert (7 / 1) to (7 / 1) x (4 / 4) = (28 / 4).

Now we can compare the numerators: 9 is less than 28, so (9 / 4) is less than (28 / 4), which is the same as (7 / 1).

Reasoning: To compare the fractions (9 / 10) and (7 / 1), we need to get them to have the same denominator. The least common denominator of 10 and 1 is 10, so we convert (7 / 1) to (7 / 1) x (10 / 10) = (70 / 10).

Now we can compare the numerators: 9 is less than 70, so (9 / 10) is less than (70 / 10), which is the same as (7 / 1).

This answer is the same as the previous one, as the relationship between the fractions has not changed.

Alternatively, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 4 is 4.

(1/2) = 2/4
(1/4) = 1/4

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To compare the two fractions, we can rewrite them with a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 1 and 3 is 3.
6/1 = 6/3 = &lt;&lt;6/1*3/3=18/3=6&gt;&gt;6
4/3 = &lt;&lt;4*1/3=4/3&gt;&gt;4/3
Comparing 6 and 4/3, we can see that 6 &gt; 4/3.
### Answer: (6 / 1) &gt; (4 / 3) 

Comparing this result to the previous one, we can see that (6 / 1) is also greater than (4 / 4), so the relationship between the fractions remains the same.</pre>

Changing the denominator of the second fraction changes its value, making it larger than the first fraction. In the previous question, the second fraction was (8 / 8) which is equal to 1, and (3 / 9) is less than 1. In this question, the second fraction is (8 / 3) which is greater than 1, and (3 / 9) is still less than 1.

            For the follow-up question, consider now comparing the fractions again, but this time in this specific situation: 

(1 / 9) _ (7 / 7)

Keep in mind the comparison you made in the previous question when 1/9 was compared with 7/9. How does the comparison change when the second fraction is in this new form, 7/7? Fill the blank with the correct symbol, &lt;, &gt; or =.

### Answer:  

In this case, even though (1 / 9) is still less than (7 / 9), the comparison is not between the two fractions anymore. Instead, we are comparing (1 / 9) to 1 (which is the simplified form of 7 / 7). Since (1 / 9) is less than 1, the comparison still holds: (1 / 9) &lt; (7 / 7).</pre>

First, we can find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 7 and 6 is 42, so we can rewrite the fractions as:

(2 / 7) = (2 * 6 / 42) = 12 / 42
(1 / 6) = (1 * 7 / 42) = 7 / 42

Now, we can see that 12 / 42 is greater than 7 / 42, so (2 / 7) is greater than (1 / 6).

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To compare the values of the fractions (3 / 4) and (6 / 5), we need to find a common denominator and adjust the fractions accordingly. The common denominator of 4 and 5 is 20.

(3 / 4) = (3 \* 5) / (4 \* 5) = 15 / 20
(6 / 5) = (6 \* 4) / (5 \* 4) = 24 / 20

Comparing the adjusted fractions, we can see that (15 / 20) &lt; (24 / 20).

Comparing the two products, we see that 50 is greater than 36.
### Answer: (5 / 9) &gt; (4 / 10) 

When we change the denominator of the second fraction from 7 to 10, the fraction becomes smaller. This is because the fraction is now equivalent to a smaller fraction, since the same numerator is now spread out over a larger denominator. This results in a smaller value for the fraction, which is why (5 / 9) is now greater than (4 / 10).</pre>

### Answer: &lt; 

To compare fractions, you can find a common denominator and then compare the numerators. In this case, the common denominator is 9, and when you convert both fractions to have this denominator, you get (8 / 9) and (21 / 9). Since 21 is greater than 8, (8 / 9) is less than (7 / 3).</pre>

            Let's consider a slight change to our earlier comparison. What if instead of having 8 out of 10 parts, you now have 8 divided by 2 parts? 

Fill in the blank with the correct symbol to compare the following fractions:

(8 / 2) _ (1 / 1)

Explanation: To compare the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 8 in this case.

(5 / 1) = (5 * 8) / 8 = 40 / 8
(5 / 8) = 5 / 8

Since 40 / 8 &gt; 5 / 8, we can conclude that (5 / 1) &gt; (5 / 8).

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> (5 / 3) &gt; (5 / 8)

Explanation: To compare the two fractions, we can use the same method as before.

(5 / 3) = (5 * 8) / 24 = 40 / 24
(5 / 8) = 5 / 8

Since 40 / 24 &gt; 5 / 8, we can conclude that (5 / 3) &gt; (5 / 8).

In the context of the problem, if the first basket initially had 5/3 of the apples, it would have more apples than the second basket, which has 5/8 of the apples.

Explanation: In this case, we are comparing two fractions with the same numerator (1) but different denominators (5 and 10). The fraction with the smaller denominator represents a larger portion of the whole.

Since 5 &lt; 10, (1 / 5) represents a larger portion than (1 / 10), and therefore (1 / 5) &gt; (1 / 10).
### Answer: &gt; 

Explanation continued: This is because the fraction (1 / 5) represents a larger portion of the whole than (1 / 10) does. In other words, having 1 part out of 5 is more than having 1 part out of 10.</pre>

Now, we can compare the two fractions: 10/8 = 1.25 and 80/8 = 10. Since 1.25 &lt; 10, (10 / 8) &lt; (10 / 1).

We also convert 10/3 to have a denominator of 24: 10/3 \* (8/8) = 80/24.

Now, we can compare the two fractions: 30/24 = 1.25 and 80/24 = 3.33. Since 1.25 &lt; 3.33, (10 / 8) &lt; (10 / 3).

### Answer: &gt; 

Reasoning: The value of a fraction is determined by both the numerator and the denominator. When the denominator is smaller, the fraction is larger. In this case, (10 / 10) is equal to 1, and (4 / 9) is less than 1.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> To compare the fractions (8/1) and (4/9), we need to determine which fraction is greater or if they are equal.

First, let's simplify the fractions to their lowest terms. Both fractions are already in their simplest form.

Next, we can compare the numerators and denominators of the fractions. When the numerators are equal, the fraction with the smaller denominator is the larger fraction. However, in this case, the numerators are not equal.

To compare, we can find a common denominator for both fractions. In this case, the least common multiple of 1 and 9 is 9. We can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 9:

(8/1) x (9/9) = (72/9)
(4/9) x (1/1) = (4/9)

(10/7) x (2/2) = 20/14
(3/2) x (7/7) = 21/14

Reasoning: To compare the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 9. So, we convert (5 / 1) to (45 / 9). Since 45 is greater than 6, we can say that (6 / 9) is less than (5 / 1).</pre>
