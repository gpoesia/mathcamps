        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all its sides. Since a rectangle has two equal sides, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l+w), where l is the length and w is the width.

In this case, the length l = 44m and the width w = 17m.

So, the perimeter P = 2(l+w) = 2(44+17) = 2(61) = &lt;&lt;2*61=122&gt;&gt;122 meters.

So, the area of this new rectangle is 16*9 = &lt;&lt;16*9=144&gt;&gt;144 square meters.
### Answer: 144 square meters. 

[3] A right triangle has a base of 12m and a height of 16m. What is the length of the hypotenuse?

Reasoning: The length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the legs of the triangle and c is the hypotenuse.

First, we need to find the square of the legs: 12^2 = &lt;&lt;12^2=144&gt;&gt;144 and 16^2 = &lt;&lt;16^2=256&gt;&gt;256.

Then, we add the squares of the legs: 144 + 256 = &lt;&lt;144+256=400&gt;&gt;400.

Finally, we find the square root of the sum to get the length of the hypotenuse: sqrt(400) = &lt;&lt;sqrt(400)=20&gt;&gt;20.

In this case, the length L is 1m and the width W is 6m.

So, the perimeter P = 2(1m + 6m) = 2(7m) = &lt;&lt;2*7=14&gt;&gt;14m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two sides with equal length and two sides with equal width, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(L+W), where L is the length and W is the width.

In this case, the length L is 3 meters and the width W is 39 meters, so the perimeter P is:

P = 2(L+W) = 2(3+39) = 2(42) = &lt;&lt;2*42=84&gt;&gt;84 meters

### Answer: 110 meters 

In this new scenario, the perimeter increased because the length of the rectangle increased.</pre>
