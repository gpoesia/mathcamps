Let's denote the length of the unknown side as x.
Then, the total perimeter equation is: 6cm + 4cm + 95cm + 34cm + 19cm + 14cm + 26cm + x = 224cm
Solving for x, we get: x = 224cm - (6cm + 4cm + 95cm + 34cm + 19cm + 14cm + 26cm)

To find the length of each side, divide the perimeter by the number of sides:

Side length = Perimeter / Number of sides
Side length = 329m / 7

62m + 76m + 98m + 74m + x (the unknown side) + 54m + 4m + 24m + 48m = 452m

Solving for x:

x = 452m - (62m + 76m + 98m + 74m + 54m + 4m + 24m + 48m)
x = 452m - 484m
x = -32m

The sum of the lengths of the other 8 sides is: 50+31+24+28+13+97+63+88 = &lt;&lt;50+31+24+28+13+97+63+88=494&gt;&gt;494 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total perimeter of the decagon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. We are given the lengths of 9 sides and the total perimeter, so we can find the length of the tenth side by subtracting the sum of the lengths of the other 9 sides from the total perimeter.

First, let's find the sum of the lengths of the other 9 sides:

96m + 88m + 74m + 52m + 45m + 74m + 85m + 85m + 43m = 642m

Now, let's find the length of the tenth side:

682m - 642m = &lt;&lt;682-642=40&gt;&gt;40m

We also know that 8 of the sides measure 24m, 25m, 75m, 38m, 18m, 42m, and 61m, which add up to 283m. Therefore, the length of the remaining unknown side is 359m - 283m = &lt;&lt;359-283=76&gt;&gt;76m.

The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
Let's denote the length of one side as &quot;a&quot;.
Then, 8*a = 592 cm.
Now, we can find the length of one side: a = 592 / 8 = &lt;&lt;592/8=74&gt;&gt;74 cm.
