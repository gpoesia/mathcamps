        A songwriter creates a long ballad with many verses. Each verse has 162 words and he divides these into 18 lines per verse. This gives a certain number of words per line. To each line, he adds 34 more words as a refrain. What is the total number of words present in each line now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The songwriter divides 162 words into 18 lines, so each line has 162/18 = &lt;&lt;162/18=9&gt;&gt;9 words.
He adds 34 more words to each line as a refrain, so each line now has 9+34 = &lt;&lt;9+34=43&gt;&gt;43 words.

        Following from the previous problem, the songwriter then decides to add an extra refrain to the end of each verse. If the refrain has 39 words, determine how many words are in each line after this final addition.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The songwriter adds an extra refrain of 39 words to each verse.
Since there are 18 lines in each verse, the extra refrain adds 39/18 = &lt;&lt;39/18=2.1666666666666665&gt;&gt;2.17 words to each line (rounded to two decimal places).
So, each line now has 43+2.17 = &lt;&lt;43+2.17=45.17&gt;&gt;45.17 words (rounded to two decimal places).

        In the previous problem, the songwriter added 34 words as the refrain to each line in his song. However, what if he had decided to keep the refrain a bit shorter and added only 28 words to each line instead? How many words would each line of the song contain in that case?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The songwriter divides 162 words into 18 lines, so each line has 162/18 = &lt;&lt;162/18=9&gt;&gt;9 words.
He adds 28 more words to each line as a refrain, so each line now has 9+28 = &lt;&lt;9+28=37&gt;&gt;37 words.

        A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins she’d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

1. The biologist counted 35 penguins on the first ice floe.
2. In another part of the Antarctic, she found approximately 598 penguins divided evenly among 26 ice floes. So, each ice floe had 598/26 = &lt;&lt;598/26=23&gt;&gt;23 penguins.
3. The penguin population on the first ice floe increased by 49, so there were 35 + 49 = &lt;&lt;35+49=84&gt;&gt;84 penguins.
4. She decided to take 33 more penguins into account, but then realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. So, she added 33 - 10 = &lt;&lt;33-10=23&gt;&gt;23 penguins to her count.
5. Her final step was to add in the penguins she’d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. So, she added 20 + 14 = &lt;&lt;20+14=34&gt;&gt;34 penguins to her count.
6. In total, she counted 84 + 23 + 34 = &lt;&lt;84+23+34=141&gt;&gt;141 penguins.

        In a local park, a jungle gym has a total of 27 steps. If the top 19 steps are blue and rest along with another 19 steps are red, we get a certain number of colored steps. On another jungle gym, there are 34 green steps. What is the total number of colored steps on the two jungle gyms?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The jungle gym has 27 steps in total, with the top 19 steps being blue. This means that the bottom 27-19 = &lt;&lt;27-19=8&gt;&gt;8 steps are red. Additionally, there are another 19 red steps, making a total of 8+19 = &lt;&lt;8+19=27&gt;&gt;27 red steps.
The total number of colored steps on the first jungle gym is 19 (blue) + 27 (red) = &lt;&lt;19+27=46&gt;&gt;46 steps.
The second jungle gym has 34 green steps.
The total number of colored steps on the two jungle gyms is 46 (first jungle gym) + 34 (second jungle gym) = &lt;&lt;46+34=80&gt;&gt;80 steps.

        If a cloud releases 47 millimeters of rainfall per hour over a one hour period, and the average cloud typically releases 775 millimeters of rainfall over the course of 31 hours, find the amount of rainfall from the following condition. 

Subtract 22 from the average rainfall of the typical cloud per hour then multiply this by 23. Add this result to a constant cloud factor of 42. Add this new result to the hourly rainfall of the initial cloud and subtract 2 from it. What is the resultant millimeters of rainfall?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

First, find the average rainfall per hour of a typical cloud:
775 millimeters / 31 hours = &lt;&lt;775/31=25.00&gt;&gt;25 millimeters per hour

Next, subtract 22 from the average rainfall per hour of a typical cloud:
25 - 22 = &lt;&lt;25-22=3&gt;&gt;3 millimeters per hour

Then, multiply this result by 23:
3 * 23 = &lt;&lt;3\*23=69&gt;&gt;69 millimeters

Add this result to the constant cloud factor of 42:
69 + 42 = &lt;&lt;69+42=111&gt;&gt;111 millimeters

Add this new result to the hourly rainfall of the initial cloud:
47 + 111 = &lt;&lt;47+111=158&gt;&gt;158 millimeters

Finally, subtract 2 from this result:
158 - 2 = &lt;&lt;158-2=156&gt;&gt;156 millimeters

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The boy started with 37 straws and removed 4, leaving him with 37-4 = &lt;&lt;37-4=33&gt;&gt;33 straws.
He then removed another 23 straws, leaving him with 33-23 = &lt;&lt;33-23=10&gt;&gt;10 straws.
He multiplied the remaining number of straws by 45, resulting in 10*45 = &lt;&lt;10\*45=450&gt;&gt;450 straws.
He then subtracted 25 from that total, leaving him with 450-25 = &lt;&lt;450-25=425&gt;&gt;425 straws.
Finally, he took out 7 more straws, leaving him with 425-7 = &lt;&lt;425-7=418&gt;&gt;418 straws.

        At the zoo, there were 2 trips being hosted. Each trip was allowed to see 2 animals. However, each animal had 3 baby animals with them, making the number of animals seen per trip multiplied by 3. If each baby animal could be photographed 21 times, how many photos could be taken in total? Also, if 34 photos were spoiled and unusable out of the entire batch, but guests were given the opportunity to take an additional 30 photos later, how many usable photos would there be in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Each trip saw 2 animals, and each animal had 3 baby animals, so each trip saw 2*3 = &lt;&lt;2*3=6&gt;&gt;6 baby animals.
Each baby animal could be photographed 21 times, so each trip could take 6*21 = &lt;&lt;6*21=126&gt;&gt;126 photos.
Since there were 2 trips, the total number of photos that could be taken was 2*126 = &lt;&lt;2*126=252&gt;&gt;252.
If 34 photos were spoiled and unusable, then there were 252-34 = &lt;&lt;252-34=218&gt;&gt;218 usable photos.
If guests were given the opportunity to take an additional 30 photos later, then there would be 218+30 = &lt;&lt;218+30=248&gt;&gt;248 usable photos in total.

Since there were 2 trips, the total number of photos that could be taken was 2*96 = &lt;&lt;2*96=192&gt;&gt;192.
If 34 photos were spoiled and unusable, then there were 192-34 = &lt;&lt;192-34=158&gt;&gt;158 usable photos.

        In revisiting the literacy event, let's consider a different scenario. When the learners formed the word with 47 letters and due to a mistake had to remove 30, instead of adding 10 letters, what if they added only 10 - 16 = -6 letters? What would the total number of letters be in the word after this change?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: In this scenario, the learners had a word with 47 letters. After removing 30 letters, they had 47-30 = &lt;&lt;47-30=17&gt;&gt;17 letters left. Instead of adding 10 letters, they added 10 - 16 = -6 letters. However, adding a negative number of letters is equivalent to removing that number of letters. So, they removed 6 letters from the 17 letters they had, leaving them with 17-6 = &lt;&lt;17-6=11&gt;&gt;11 letters.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Tommy's initial speed is 74/37 = &lt;&lt;74/37=2&gt;&gt;2 mph.
If Tommy slows down by 3 mph, his new speed is 2 - 3 = &lt;&lt;2-3=-1&gt;&gt;-1 mph. However, since speed cannot be negative, we can assume that Tommy stops moving for a while instead of moving at a negative speed.
To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Since we don't have this information, we cannot calculate the average speed.

        Following the same snowfall pattern, but this time if April were to receive a slightly higher snowfall, with an additional 44 inches of snowfall early on, but then 27 inches melted by the end of the month, how many inches of snow would this sum up to at the end of April now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: In January, there were 47 inches of snowfall.
In February, there were 7 inches of snowfall in early February and 17 inches on February 15th, making a total of 7+17 = &lt;&lt;7+17=24&gt;&gt;24 inches for February.
In March, there were 48 inches of snowfall.
In April, there were 44 inches of snowfall early on, but 27 inches melted, making a total of 44-27 = &lt;&lt;44-27=17&gt;&gt;17 inches for April.
The total amount of snowfall from January to April is 47+24+48+17 = &lt;&lt;47+24+48+17=136&gt;&gt;136 inches.

        At a fair, a vendor sold balloons. On a particularly busy day, he sold 46 balloons every hour for 11 hours straight. After the fair had closed, he ended up selling an additional 31 balloons to some stragglers. How many balloons did he sell in total that day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The vendor sold 46 balloons/hour * 11 hours = &lt;&lt;46*11=506&gt;&gt;506 balloons during the fair.
He sold an additional 31 balloons after the fair had closed.
So, he sold 506 + 31 = &lt;&lt;506+31=537&gt;&gt;537 balloons in total that day.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: In the first game, Mary and John scored a combined total of 31 + 39 = &lt;&lt;31+39=70&gt;&gt;70 points.
In the second game, their combined score was increased by 35 more points, so they scored 70 + 35 = &lt;&lt;70+35=105&gt;&gt;105 points.
During the special round, they could multiply their score by the difference between 27 and the number of cards left in the deck, which was 23. So, their final score in the special round was 105 \* (27 - 23) = &lt;&lt;105*(27-23)=525&gt;&gt;525 points.

        The Space Institute realized that the initial magnification power of the existing telescope was actually 16, not 26 as previously thought. If they still want to reach a magnification strength of 41, how much more magnification is now needed compared to the existing telescope?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The new telescope needs to have a magnification strength of 41. The existing telescope has a magnification power of 16.

1. The company initially produced 30 beach towels and 6 hand towels, which is a total of 30 + 6 = &lt;&lt;30+6=36&gt;&gt;36 towels.
2. They gave away 7 towels for charity, leaving them with 36 - 7 = &lt;&lt;36-7=29&gt;&gt;29 towels.
3. They then produced 14 more towels, adding to their current stock, making it 29 + 14 = &lt;&lt;29+14=43&gt;&gt;43 towels.
4. They made a special batch of 13 towels for every towel left after their charity activity, which is 13 * 29 = &lt;&lt;13*29=377&gt;&gt;377 towels.

        A toothbrush factory produces 37 toothbrushes per minute at the start of its morning shift. A little later, it increases its production to rate to 308 toothbrushes every 7 minutes. If this increased rate of production continued for 16 minutes, how many toothbrushes were produced in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: At the start of the morning shift, the factory produces 37 toothbrushes per minute.
Later, the factory increases its production rate to 308 toothbrushes every 7 minutes, which is equivalent to 308/7 = &lt;&lt;308/7=44&gt;&gt;44 toothbrushes per minute.
The factory produces at this increased rate for 16 minutes, so it produces 44 \* 16 = &lt;&lt;44\*16=704&gt;&gt;704 toothbrushes during this time.
The factory also produces 37 toothbrushes per minute for the first few minutes of the morning shift before the rate increases. Since we don't know how long the factory produced at the initial rate, we can't calculate the exact number of toothbrushes produced at this rate. However, we can calculate the total number of toothbrushes produced by adding the number produced at the increased rate to the number produced at the initial rate.
Let x be the number of minutes the factory produced at the initial rate. Then, the total number of toothbrushes produced is 37x + 704.
Since we don't have enough information to determine the value of x, we can't calculate the exact number of toothbrushes produced. However, we can express the total number of toothbrushes produced as 37x + 704.

        Originally, the magical unicorn had 50 red roses and 36 blue roses in her mystical garden. But if she had initially had 50 red roses and 38 blue roses instead, and still lost 25 roses in the storm, how many roses would she have left in her garden after the storm?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: If the unicorn had initially had 50 red roses and 38 blue roses, and still lost 25 roses in the storm, then she would have lost 25 blue roses, leaving her with 38-25 = &lt;&lt;38-25=13&gt;&gt;13 blue roses.
The unicorn would have 50 red roses + 13 blue roses = &lt;&lt;50+13=63&gt;&gt;63 roses left in her garden after the storm.

        A chocolatier has decided to make small chocolate bars that weigh 176 grams each. To get the right size, he divides each bar into 8 pieces, which means each piece weighs a certain number of grams. 

He then decides to make a new batch of chocolate using a special recipe. This recipe calls for a total of 38 grams of cocoa, but subtraction the weight of one piece from the 176g bars, plus an additional 26 grams of sugar.

Simultaneously, the chocolatier decides to create another batch of chocolates that needs a total of 38 grams of cocoa and 18 grams of milk.

What is the difference in the total weight of ingredients between the second and third batch of chocolates?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, let's find out the weight of each piece of the 176g bar. Since each bar is divided into 8 pieces, each piece weighs 176/8 = &lt;&lt;176/8=22&gt;&gt;22 grams.

For the second batch of chocolates, the chocolatier uses 38 grams of cocoa and 26 grams of sugar. The total weight of ingredients for this batch is 38 + 26 = &lt;&lt;38+26=64&gt;&gt;64 grams.

For the third batch of chocolates, the chocolatier uses 38 grams of cocoa and 18 grams of milk. The total weight of ingredients for this batch is 38 + 18 = &lt;&lt;38+18=56&gt;&gt;56 grams.

The difference in the total weight of ingredients between the second and third batch of chocolates is 64 - 56 = &lt;&lt;64-56=8&gt;&gt;8 grams.

After that, the result is multiplied by 7 and again by 1. However, for the final step, you subtract 48 from the result. If you follow these steps, how powerful will the ring's magic be?

Next, we multiply this result by 7, which gives us 18\*7 = &lt;&lt;18\*7=126&gt;&gt;126.
Then, we multiply this result by 1, which gives us 126\*1 = &lt;&lt;126\*1=126&gt;&gt;126.
Finally, we subtract 48 from this result, which gives us 126-48 = &lt;&lt;126-48=78&gt;&gt;78.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The silversmith had 16 silver rings in stock initially.
He created 28 silver and 24 gold rings, so he had 16+28+24 = &lt;&lt;16+28+24=68&gt;&gt;68 rings after the creation stage.
He traded some rings and ended up with 68-21 = &lt;&lt;68-21=47&gt;&gt;47 rings.
For a special order, he created 26*47 = &lt;&lt;26\*47=1222&gt;&gt;1222 rings.

2. You add 13 drops of white paint, making the total 41 + 13 = &lt;&lt;41+13=54&gt;&gt;54 drops.
3. You add the same amount of red paint as before, which is 41 drops, making the total 54 + 41 = &lt;&lt;54+41=95&gt;&gt;95 drops.
4. You take a sample of 34 drops from this mixture, leaving 95 - 34 = &lt;&lt;95-34=61&gt;&gt;61 drops in the original mixture.
5. You add the 34 drop sample to a new mixture, making the total 34 drops.
6. You take away the same amount of the 34 drop sample that you took originally, which is 34 drops, leaving 34 - 34 = &lt;&lt;34-34=0&gt;&gt;0 drops in the new mixture.

However, since you are adding the 34 drop sample to the new mixture and then taking away the same amount, the number of drops in the new mixture remains unchanged. Therefore, there are still 34 drops in the new mixture.

After bringing in 14 more sharks, there are 7+14 = &lt;&lt;7+14=21&gt;&gt;21 sharks.
After moving 3 more sharks, there are 21-3 = &lt;&lt;21-3=18&gt;&gt;18 sharks left.
The number of sharks is then multiplied by 43, resulting in 18\*43 = &lt;&lt;18\*43=774&gt;&gt;774 sharks for the research study.

        In a puzzle game, each round you collect 150 points which are then divided by 10 to determine the number of gold coins you earn. After two rounds, you earned some gold coins.

In the third round, you collected 28 emeralds and 14 sapphires but you had to sacrifice the same amount of gold coins as you earned in the first two rounds. How many emeralds and sapphires did you have left after the third round?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: In the first two rounds, you earned 150/10 = &lt;&lt;150/10=15&gt;&gt;15 gold coins per round, so you earned 15*2 = &lt;&lt;15*2=30&gt;&gt;30 gold coins in total.
In the third round, you had to sacrifice 30 gold coins, so you had 28-30 = &lt;&lt;28-30=-2&gt;&gt;-2 emeralds and 14-30 = &lt;&lt;14-30=-16&gt;&gt;-16 sapphires left.
Since you can't have a negative number of emeralds or sapphires, you had 0 emeralds and 0 sapphires left after the third round.

On the following Monday, the train carries 27 + 26 = &lt;&lt;27+26=53&gt;&gt;53 containers.
On Wednesday, the load decreases by 32 containers, so the train carries 53 - 32 = &lt;&lt;53-32=21&gt;&gt;21 containers.

        The previous problem had us determine the total number of police officers on duty under certain conditions. Now, let's imagine a slightly different scenario.

Like the previous situation, there were still 32 officers assigned to the north district and 33 sent to the south. The number for the downtown district was also the same, at 29. However, this time around, only 21 officers from the total force were transferred elsewhere instead of the original scenario's subtraction. A week later, an additional 22 officers, fewer than the 39 from the original scenario, were brought in for a different assignment. That same day, another addition of 14 officers was made, just like with the initial series of events.

        A toothpaste factory produces 26 tubes of toothpaste every hour. On Sundays, they work for 7 hours and produce additional 8 tubes of toothpaste. So, in one Sunday, they produce ((26 * 7) + 8) tubes.

The following Monday, they continue their production by adding another 31 tubes to their Sunday's total.

In parallel, in the packaging department, they have 50 empty boxes. They use 19 of them for another department, leaving them with (50 - 19) boxes.

The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is calculated by adding the packaged boxes number with Monday's production.

On Tuesday, they produced an additional 48 tubes of toothpaste. What is the total number of produced toothpaste tubes until Tuesday, inclusive?

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

On Sunday, they produce 26 * 7 + 8 = &lt;&lt;26*7+8=186&gt;&gt;186 tubes of toothpaste.

On Monday, they add 31 tubes to Sunday's total, so they have 186 + 31 = &lt;&lt;186+31=217&gt;&gt;217 tubes of toothpaste.

In the packaging department, they have 50 - 19 = &lt;&lt;50-19=31&gt;&gt;31 boxes left.

The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is 217 + 31 = &lt;&lt;217+31=248&gt;&gt;248 tubes.

On Tuesday, they produce an additional 48 tubes of toothpaste, so the total number of produced toothpaste tubes until Tuesday, inclusive, is 248 + 48 = &lt;&lt;248+48=296&gt;&gt;296 tubes.

        A gardener planted 13 Sunflowers in his garden. The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed. By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on and the spots needed, then he doubled that total for no particular reason. How many did he end up with?

The next day, he subtracted 10 from that number, so he planted 167 - 10 = &lt;&lt;167-10=157&gt;&gt;157 sunflowers.
He then added his initial 13 sunflowers back, creating a new total of 157 + 13 = &lt;&lt;157+13=170&gt;&gt;170 sunflowers.
For the orchids, he calculated the number of spots needed as 92 / 23 = &lt;&lt;92/23=4&gt;&gt;4 spots.
By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on (170 sunflowers + 92 orchids) and the spots needed (4), which is 170 + 92 + 4 = &lt;&lt;170+92+4=266&gt;&gt;266.

        A treasure chest contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds. Unfortunately, 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed. The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest. 

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

What is the value (m) of the remaining treasure?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

First chest:
The number of real stones left (y) is 23 emeralds + 30 diamonds - 39 fake stones = 14 real stones.
The value of the chest (g) is y^2 - 37 = 14^2 - 37 = 196 - 37 = 159.

Second chest:
The number of rubies per pirate is 540/45 = 12 rubies.
The remaining number of rubies (x) is 12*45 - 3 = 537 rubies.
The new value is g - x = 159 - 537 = -378.

The count of remaining treasure (s) is 23 pearls + 11 zirconias - 9 damaged pieces = 25 pieces.
The value of the remaining treasure (m) is -378 - 25 = -403.

Subtracting the initial confirmed sightings from this new daily average gives 36-6 = &lt;&lt;36-6=30&gt;&gt;30 sightings per day.
The maximum number of sightings recorded in one day is 9, and subtracting the number you would typically dismiss as random (3) gives 9-3 = &lt;&lt;9-3=6&gt;&gt;6 sightings.
Multiplying the adjusted daily average by this number gives 30*6 = &lt;&lt;30\*6=180&gt;&gt;180 sightings.

        Lemonville is a small village known for its lemon trees. One year, the villagers picked 38 baskets of lemons from the trees near the river and 24 baskets from the ones near an old well. From the trees near the school, they picked 16 more baskets and from the trees near the mayor's house, they picked 13 more baskets. They realized that their lemons were heavier and they could extract more juice so they decided to get 35 baskets to make lemonade. If each basket of lemons could produce 14 bottles of lemonade, how many bottles of lemonade would they get from the remaining baskets?

        A hiker traveled an average of 900 miles in 36 days. One day, he increases his daily average to 16 miles. This reduces his remaining journey by a certain number of days. After that, he finds a shortcut which saves him an additional 4 days, and a friendly traveller advised him of another path that will save him 40 days.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The hiker's original daily average is 900 miles / 36 days = &lt;&lt;900/36=25&gt;&gt;25 miles per day.
The hiker increases his daily average to 16 miles, which is 16 - 25 = &lt;&lt;16-25=-9&gt;&gt;9 miles per day less than his original average.
The hiker's remaining journey is reduced by (9 miles/day) \* (36 days - 1 day) = &lt;&lt;(9\*(36-1))=315&gt;&gt;315 miles.
The hiker saves 315 miles / 16 miles/day = &lt;&lt;315/16=19.6875&gt;&gt;19.6875 days due to the increased daily average.
The hiker saves an additional 4 days due to the shortcut.
The hiker saves an additional 40 days due to the friendly traveller's advice.
The hiker saves an additional 21 days due to good weather.
The hiker saves a total of 19.6875 + 4 + 40 + 21 = &lt;&lt;19.6875+4+40+21=84.6875&gt;&gt;84.6875 days on his journey.

        A cat started playing with yarn balls. In her first game, she managed to accumulate 5 yarn balls. In her second game, she got as many balls as the square of what she obtained in the first game plus 8 more. Finally, she lost some of her balls in her third game due to a playful dog. She ended the game with a number of balls which is 25 times the difference between 45 and what she accumulated from the second game. How many yarn balls does the cat have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: In the first game, the cat accumulated 5 yarn balls.
In the second game, she got 5^2 + 8 = &lt;&lt;5^2+8=25+8=33&gt;&gt;33 yarn balls.
In the third game, she ended up with 25 * (45 - 33) = &lt;&lt;25*(45-33)=25*12=300&gt;&gt;300 yarn balls.
However, this number is not possible since she started with only 33 yarn balls in the third game. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement.

Assuming that the cat ended up with 25 times the difference between 45 and what she accumulated from the second game, but the number of balls she had in the third game was not affected by the playful dog, then she would have ended up with 25 * (45 - 33) = 300 yarn balls.

But since the problem states that she lost some of her balls in the third game, we need to know how many balls she lost to determine the final number of balls she has.

Without this information, we cannot determine the final number of yarn balls the cat has.

        A basket contains 41 balls. The balls are split into two types - tennis balls and cricket balls. If we remove 16 balls from the basket, we get cricket balls. When 9 ping pong balls and 21 basketballs are added to the basket, what is the total number of balls in the basket?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Initially, there are 41 balls in the basket. After removing 16 balls, we are left with 41-16 = &lt;&lt;41-16=25&gt;&gt;25 balls, which are all cricket balls.

When we add 9 ping pong balls and 21 basketballs to the basket, the total number of balls becomes 25 + 9 + 21 = &lt;&lt;25+9+21=55&gt;&gt;55 balls.

        The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

First, let's find out how many squares your friend needs for the hours:

They subtracted 32 from 37, which gives them 5.
Then they added 42 to the result, which gives them 47.
Finally, they subtracted 37 from that total, which gives them 10.

So, your friend needs 10 more squares for the hours.

Now, let's find out how many squares they need for the minutes and seconds:

They added 41 to 25, which gives them 66.
Then they added another 28, which gives them 94.
Finally, they added 17 to the result, which gives them 111.

So, your friend needs 111 squares for the minutes and seconds.

Now, let's find out how many squares they need in total:

They decided to reduce the total number of squares by 23, which gives them 111 - 23 = 88.

Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number, which gives them 10 + 88 = &lt;&lt;10+88=98&gt;&gt;98.

        Your clockmaker friend continues to work at their quirky clock. They thought about the previous calculation for hour squares and realized they made a mistake. Instead of subtracting 37 from the sum of the unfinished hour squares (after adding 42), they should have subtracted only 13. 

So, they re-did the maths: subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted only 13 from that total.

Everything else remained the same, including the additional 25 squares for the minutes, followed by another 28 squares for the seconds. The following calculations also didn't change: they added 41 to 25, added 28 to the result and then added 17 to the final number.

But, just like before, they realized they still lack some material and decided to go on with their decision to reduce the total number of squares by 23. In the end, they added this reduced total to the newly calculated number for hours (after subtracting 13 instead of 37).

Can you help your friend figure out (again!) how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock project with the new calculation?
