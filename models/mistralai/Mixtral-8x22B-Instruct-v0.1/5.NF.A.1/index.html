        John has been learning to add and subtract fractions at school. He was given a problem during his homework that puzzled him. He had to take the sum of 48/56 and 95/23 and then subtract 34/26 from the result. What was the value that John found for this operation? Answer in simplest form.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find the sum of 48/56 and 95/23. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 56 and 23 is 1244.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

48/56 = (48 \* 23)/(56 \* 23) = 1104/1244

95/23 = (95 \* 54)/(23 \* 54) = 5130/1244

Now, we can add the two fractions:

1104/1244 + 5130/1244 = (1104 + 5130)/1244 = 6234/1244

Next, we need to subtract 34/26 from the result. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 1244 and 26 is 1244.

So, we convert the fraction to have the same denominator:

34/26 = (34 \* 48)/(26 \* 48) = 1632/1244

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:

6234/1244 - 1632/1244 = (6234 - 1632)/1244 = 4602/1244

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

4602/1244 = (4602/2)/(1244/2) = 2301/622

        First, add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65. Then subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result. What is the result expressed as a simple fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 65 is 585.

88/9 = (88 \* 65) / (9 \* 65) = 5720/585
28/65 = (28 \* 9) / (65 \* 9) = 252/585

Now we can add the two fractions:

5720/585 + 252/585 = (5720 + 252) / 585 = 5972/585

Next, we need to subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 585 and 37. The least common multiple of 585 and 37 is 21615.

5972/585 = (5972 \* 37) / (585 \* 37) = 220904/21615
18/37 = (18 \* 585) / (37 \* 585) = 10530/21615

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

220904/21615 - 10530/21615 = (220904 - 10530) / 21615 = 210374/21615

The result is 210374/21615, which can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 210374 and 21615 is 1. Therefore, the result expressed as a simple fraction is 210374/21615.

        John had 71/41 of a cake left and Emily added 41/77 of another cake to it. How much cake is there in total? Give your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 41 and 77 is 307.

John's cake can be expressed as (71/41) \* (77/77) = 5467/307
Emily's cake can be expressed as (41/77) \* (41/41) = 1681/307

Adding the two fractions, we get 5467/307 + 1681/307 = 7148/307

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

Therefore, the total amount of cake is 7148/307.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 65 and 35 is 2275.

10/65 = (10 * 35)/(65 * 35) = 350/2275
56/35 = (56 * 65)/(35 * 65) = 3640/2275

Now we can add the two fractions:

350/2275 + 3640/2275 = (350 + 3640)/2275 = 3990/2275

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

3990/2275 = (3990/5)/(2275/5) = 798/455

Now we can simplify the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 11:

798/455 = (798/11)/(455/11) = 72/41

75/81 = (75 \* 47)/(81 \* 47) = 3525/3807

97/47 = (97 \* 81)/(47 \* 81) = 7857/3807

Adding the two fractions, we get:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We have already calculated the result of adding 75/81 and 97/47 as 11382/3807.

To add this result to 52/71, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3807 and 71 is 270477.

11382/3807 = (11382 \* 71)/(3807 \* 71) = 808182/270477

52/71 = (52 \* 3807)/(71 \* 3807) = 197964/270477

Adding the two fractions, we get:

808182/270477 + 197964/270477 = (808182 + 197964)/270477 = 1006146/270477

78/59 = &lt;&lt;78/59=6/5&gt;&gt;6/5

Now, we can add the two fractions:

(40/47) + (6/5) = (40/47) \* (5/5) + (6/5) \* (47/47) = (200/235) + (282/235) = &lt;&lt;200/235+282/235=482/235&gt;&gt;482/235

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 56 and 50 is 140.

89/56 = (89\*2.5)/(56\*2.5) = 222.5/140

48/50 = (48\*2.8)/(50\*2.8) = 134.4/140

Now we can add the two fractions:

222.5/140 + 134.4/140 = (222.5 + 134.4)/140 = 356.9/140

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 140.

356.9/140 = 2.549285714285714

Since the question asks for a simplified fraction, we can round the decimal to the nearest whole number, which is 3.

### Answer: 3

Note: The answer is not a simplified fraction, as the question asks for. The correct answer is 2.549285714285714, which can be rounded to 3 for simplicity. However, the question asks for a simplified fraction, so the answer should be written as 3/1.</pre>

        Determine the sum of 33/41 and 95/62. Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 41 and 62 is 2542.

33/41 = (33 \* 62)/(41 \* 62) = 2046/2542

95/62 = (95 \* 41)/(62 \* 41) = 3895/2542

Now we can add the two fractions:

2046/2542 + 3895/2542 = (2046 + 3895)/2542 = 5941/2542

The fraction 5941/2542 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

Therefore, the sum of 33/41 and 95/62 is 5941/2542.

Now we need to add that sum to 95/62 once again.

5941/2542 + 95/62 = (5941 \* 62)/(2542 \* 62) + (95 \* 2542)/(62 \* 2542)

= 368342/157804 + 241490/157804

= (368342 + 241490)/157804

= 609832/157804

The fraction 609832/157804 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.

Therefore, the final simplified fraction is 152458/39451.

Now we can add the two fractions:

2046/2542 + 3403/2542 = (2046 + 3403)/2542 = 5449/2542

The fraction 5449/2542 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

Next, add the result to (81 / 34):
(52 / 11) + (81 / 34) = (52 * 34) / (11 * 34) + (81 * 11) / (34 * 11) = (1768 + 891) / (374) = 2659 / 374

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to simplify the fractions (64 / 34) and (3 / 24).

(64 / 34) = &lt;&lt;64/34=18/11&gt;&gt;18/11
(3 / 24) = &lt;&lt;3/24=1/8&gt;&gt;1/8

Now, we can add the two fractions:

(18/11) + (1/8) = (144/88) + (11/88) = &lt;&lt;144/88+11/88=155/88&gt;&gt;155/88

Finally, we can add the result to (41 / 96):

(155/88) + (41/96) = (155 * 96) / (88 * 96) + (41 * 88) / (96 * 88) = (14880/8448) + (3608/8448) = &lt;&lt;14880/8448+3608/8448=18488/8448&gt;&gt;18488/8448

        Daniel has to solve a math problem for his homework that includes fractions. Initially, he has been asked to add 83/73 and 53/77. The result of this step he saved as 'w'. Then, he needs to add 80/76 to the result 'w'. How would he calculate the final answer in simplified fraction form?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, Daniel needs to add 83/73 and 53/77 to get 'w'. To add these fractions, he needs to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 73 and 77 is 5601.

So, 83/73 = (83 * 77) / (73 * 77) = 6411/5601
And, 53/77 = (53 * 73) / (77 * 73) = 3869/5601

Now, Daniel can add these two fractions:
w = 6411/5601 + 3869/5601 = (6411 + 3869) / 5601 = 10280/5601

Next, Daniel needs to add 80/76 to 'w'. The LCM of 76 and 5601 is 424076.

So, 80/76 = (80 * 5601) / (76 * 5601) = 448080/424076
And, w = 10280/5601 = (10280 * 76) / (5601 * 76) = 780480/424076

Now, Daniel can add these two fractions:
Final answer = 448080/424076 + 780480/424076 = (448080 + 780480) / 424076 = 1228560/424076

To simplify this fraction, Daniel can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 1228560 and 424076 is 4.

So, the simplified fraction is:
Final answer = 1228560/4 / 424076/4 = 307140/106019

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 66 is 660.

27/20 = (27\*33)/(20\*33) = 891/660
14/66 = (14\*10)/(66\*10) = 140/660

Now we can add the fractions:

891/660 + 140/660 = (891+140)/660 = 1031/660

The fraction 1031/660 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 1031/660.

Now we need to add this result to 58/18. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 660 and 18 is 1980.

1031/660 = (1031\*3)/(660\*3) = 3093/1980
58/18 = (58\*110)/(18\*110) = 6380/1980

Now we can add the fractions:

3093/1980 + 6380/1980 = (3093+6380)/1980 = 9473/1980

The fraction 9473/1980 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 9473/1980.

14/41 = (14\*20)/(41\*20) = 280/820

Now we can add the fractions:

1107/820 + 280/820 = (1107+280)/820 = 1387/820

The fraction 1387/820 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 1387/820.

Then, subtract 1.3 from 47 = &lt;&lt;47-1.3=45.7&gt;&gt;45.7 (rounded to one decimal place).
Next, calculate 56 / 97 = &lt;&lt;56/97=0.57732&gt;&gt;0.57732 (rounded to five decimal places).
Finally, add 0.57732 to 45.7 = &lt;&lt;45.7+0.57732=46.27732&gt;&gt;46.27732 (rounded to five decimal places).

        What is the sum of 14/89 and the sum of 24/34 and 44/87? Give your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The sum of 14/89 and the sum of 24/34 and 44/87 is (14/89) + (24/34 + 44/87).
First, we need to find the sum of 24/34 and 44/87. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 34 and 87 is 2918.
So, 24/34 = (24 \* 87)/(34 \* 87) = 2088/2918 and 44/87 = (44 \* 34)/(87 \* 34) = 1496/2918.
Now, we can find the sum of 24/34 and 44/87: 2088/2918 + 1496/2918 = 3584/2918.
Now, we can find the sum of 14/89 and 3584/2918. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 89 and 2918 is 259602.
So, 14/89 = (14 \* 2918)/(89 \* 2918) = 40852/259602 and 3584/2918 = (3584 \* 89)/(2918 \* 89) = 319616/259602.
Now, we can find the sum of 14/89 and 3584/2918: 40852/259602 + 319616/259602 = 360468/259602.
To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.
So, 360468/259602 = 180234/129801.

73/30 = (73*2)/(30*2) = 146/60
8/60 = 8/60

Now we can add the fractions:

146/60 + 8/60 = (146+8)/60 = 154/60

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

What would be the resulting sum? Please provide your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, we simplify the second fraction 45/60 = &lt;&lt;45/60=3/4&gt;&gt;3/4.
Then, we add the first fraction (82/49) with the simplified second fraction (3/4):
82/49 + 3/4 = (82*4 + 3*49)/(49*4) = (328 + 147)/196 = 475/196.
Now, we add the result 'd' (475/196) to the third fraction (99/59):
475/196 + 99/59 = (475*59 + 99*196)/(196*59) = (28075 + 19404)/11584 = 47479/11584.
Finally, we simplify the resulting fraction 47479/11584 = &lt;&lt;47479/11584=1186975/28960&gt;&gt;1186975/28960.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, subtract 76/30 from 91/16.
To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 30 and 16 is 240.
So, we convert 76/30 to 240/30 * 76/240 = 152/240 and 91/16 to 240/16 * 91/240 = 546/240.
Now, we can subtract 152/240 from 546/240 to get 394/240.
Next, we add the answer to 18/44.
To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 240 and 44 is 1320.
So, we convert 394/240 to 1320/240 * 394/1320 = 1970/1320 and 18/44 to 1320/44 * 18/1320 = 540/1320.
Now, we can add 1970/1320 to 540/1320 to get 2510/1320.
Finally, we round the answer to the nearest hundredth.
2510/1320 = 1.9015151515151515, which rounds to 1.90.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, we calculate the result of ((8 / 91) + (49 / 5)).
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 91 and 5 is 455.
So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:
(8 / 91) = (8 * 5) / (91 * 5) = 40 / 455
(49 / 5) = (49 * 91) / (5 * 91) = 4459 / 455
Now, we can add the fractions:
(40 / 455) + (4459 / 455) = (40 + 4459) / 455 = 4499 / 455
Next, we subtract (32 / 76) from the result.
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 455 and 76 is 34520.
So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:
(4499 / 455) = (4499 * 76) / (455 * 76) = 342304 / 34520
(32 / 76) = (32 * 455) / (76 * 455) = 14560 / 34520
Now, we can subtract the fractions:
(342304 / 34520) - (14560 / 34520) = (342304 - 14560) / 34520 = 327744 / 34520
Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8.
(327744 / 34520) / (8 / 8) = 40968 / 4315

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find the sum of ((78 / 45) + (89 / 36)).

(78 / 45) + (89 / 36) = (78 * 36 + 89 * 45) / (45 * 36)

= (2808 + 3960) / 1620

= 6768 / 1620

Now, we need to add this sum to itself.

6768 / 1620 + 6768 / 1620 = 2 * (6768 / 1620)

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 86/35 and 68/85, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 35 and 85 is 595.

86/35 = (86 \* 17)/(35 \* 17) = 1462/595

68/85 = (68 \* 7)/(85 \* 7) = 476/595

Now, we can add the two fractions:

1462/595 + 476/595 = (1462 + 476)/595 = 1938/595

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 17.

1938/595 = (1938/17)/(595/17) = 114/35

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 86/75 and 68/85, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 75 and 85 is 1275.

86/75 = (86 \* 17)/(75 \* 17) = 1462/1275

68/85 = (68 \* 15)/(85 \* 15) = 1020/1275

Now, we can add the two fractions:

1462/1275 + 1020/1275 = (1462 + 1020)/1275 = 2482/1275

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 17.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 53 and 94 is 53*94.

99/53 = (99*94)/(53*94) = 9306/5002

67/94 = (67*53)/(94*53) = 3551/5002

Now we can add the two fractions:

9306/5002 + 3551/5002 = (9306+3551)/5002 = 12857/5002

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

Therefore, the sum of 99/53 and 67/94 in simplest form is 12857/5002.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 27 and 33 is 297.

74/27 = (74*11)/(27*11) = 814/297
56/33 = (56*9)/(33*9) = 504/297

Now we can subtract the fractions:

814/297 - 504/297 = (814-504)/297 = 310/297

The fraction 310/297 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: From the previous question, we know that the result of 74/27 - 56/33 is 310/297.

Now we need to add 92/70 to this result. To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 297 and 70 is 20790.

310/297 = (310*70)/(297*70) = 21700/20790
92/70 = (92*297)/(70*297) = 27384/20790

Now we can add the fractions:

21700/20790 + 27384/20790 = (21700+27384)/20790 = 49084/20790

The fraction 49084/20790 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

Therefore, the simplified form of the fraction is 24542/10395.

Now we can subtract the fractions:

847/297 - 504/297 = (847-504)/297 = 343/297

The fraction 343/297 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find the sum of 96/40 and 11/99. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 40 and 99 is 3960.

So, we convert 96/40 to 96*99/40*99 = 9486/3960 and 11/99 to 11*40/99*40 = 440/3960.

Now, we can add the two fractions: 9486/3960 + 440/3960 = 9926/3960.

Next, we need to subtract 91/65 from this sum. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 9926/3960 and 91/65. The least common multiple of 3960 and 65 is 257400.

So, we convert 9926/3960 to 9926*65/3960*65 = 645290/257400 and 91/65 to 91*3960/65*3960 = 360240/257400.

Now, we can subtract the two fractions: 645290/257400 - 360240/257400 = 285050/257400.

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10.

So, the result is 28505/25740.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 75 and 92 is 75 \* 92.

92/75 + 66/92 = (92 \* 92)/(75 \* 92) + (66 \* 75)/(75 \* 92) = (8464 + 4950)/(75 \* 92) = 13414/75 \* 92

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 13414 and 75 \* 92 is 2.

13414/75 \* 92 = (13414/2)/(75 \* 92/2) = 6707/37 \* 46

        First take the whole number 51 and add it to the fraction 93/8. Take that sum and add it to the fraction 58/44. What is the final result as a simplified fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, convert the whole number 51 to a fraction with a denominator of 1, so 51 becomes 51/1.
Next, add the fractions 51/1 and 93/8. To do this, find a common denominator, which is 8 in this case. So, 51/1 becomes 408/8.
Now, add the fractions 408/8 and 93/8 to get 501/8.
Next, add the fraction 501/8 to the fraction 58/44. To do this, find a common denominator, which is 88 in this case. So, 501/8 becomes 5512/88 and 58/44 becomes 116/88.
Now, add the fractions 5512/88 and 116/88 to get 5628/88.
Finally, simplify the fraction 5628/88 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8. So, 5628/88 becomes 678/11.

82/5 = (82*5)/(5*5) = 410/25

98/25 = 98/25

Now we can subtract the fractions:

410/25 - 98/25 = (410-98)/25 = 312/25

        If you originally had 82/5 oranges and instead of taking away 98/25 of them, you took away 98/90 oranges, how many oranges would you have left? Write the answer in the simplest form.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many oranges are left, we need to subtract the number of oranges taken away from the original number of oranges.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 5, 25, and 90 is 90.

82/5 = (82*18)/(5*18) = 1476/90

98/25 = (98*3.6)/(25*3.6) = 352.8/90

98/90 = 98/90

Now we can subtract the number of oranges taken away from the original number of oranges:

1476/90 - 98/90 = (1476-98)/90 = 1378/90

The fraction 1378/90 is not in its simplest form. To simplify it, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

1378/2 = 689

90/2 = 45

So the simplest form of the fraction is 689/45.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 74 is 666.

91/74 = (91 * 9)/(74 * 9) = 819/666

Now we can add the two fractions:

444/666 + 819/666 = (444 + 819)/666 = 1263/666

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 333:

1263/666 = (1263/333)/(666/333) = 3.8/2

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

277/50 = (277 \* 39) / (50 \* 39) = 10803/1950

86/39 = (86 \* 50) / (39 \* 50) = 4300/1950

First, we calculate the value of the expression inside the parentheses:

(68 / 69) = &lt;&lt;68/69=0.9855072463768116&gt;&gt;0.9855072463768116

(93 / 7) = &lt;&lt;93/7=13.285714285714285&gt;&gt;13.285714285714285

Now, we add the two results:

0.9855072463768116 + 13.285714285714285 = &lt;&lt;0.9855072463768116+13.285714285714285=14.271221532091096&gt;&gt;14.271221532091096

Since the expression is a monomial, we can add it to (3 / 46):

(3 / 46) = &lt;&lt;3/46=0.06521739130434783&gt;&gt;0.06521739130434783

Now, we add the two results:

To provide the resulting value as a simple fraction, we can convert the decimal to a fraction:

14.336438923395444 = &lt;&lt;14.336438923395444*1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</pre>

        What is the result of adding 31/98 to 60/4? Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 98 and 4 is 196.

31/98 = (31\*2)/(98\*2) = 62/196

60/4 = (60\*49)/(4\*49) = 2940/196

Now we can add the two fractions:

62/196 + 2940/196 = (62+2940)/196 = 3002/196

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

3002/196 = (3002/2)/(196/2) = 1501/98

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: From the previous problem, we know that the sum of 31/98 and 60/4 is 1501/98.

Now we need to subtract 41/52 from this sum. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 98 and 52 is 2450.

1501/98 = (1501\*25)/(98\*25) = 37525/2450

41/52 = (41\*47)/(52\*47) = 1927/2450

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

37525/2450 - 1927/2450 = (37525-1927)/2450 = 35598/2450

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

35598/2450 = (35598/2)/(2450/2) = 17799/1225

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 98 and 4 is 196.

31/98 = (31\*2)/(98\*2) = 62/196

83/4 = (83\*49)/(4\*49) = 4067/196

Now we can add the two fractions:

62/196 + 4067/196 = (62+4067)/196 = 4129/196

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, simplify the second fraction (24/36) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12.

(24/36) = (24 ÷ 12) / (36 ÷ 12) = 2/3

Now, add the two fractions:

(3/2) + (2/3)

To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 6 in this case.

(3/2) = (3 * 3) / (2 * 3) = 9/6
(2/3) = (2 * 2) / (3 * 2) = 4/6

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, simplify the second fraction (32/36) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.

(32/36) = (32 ÷ 4) / (36 ÷ 4) = 8/9

Now, add the two fractions:

(3/2) + (8/9)

To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 18 in this case.

(3/2) = (3 * 9) / (2 * 9) = 27/18
(8/9) = (8 * 2) / (9 * 2) = 16/18

        Firstly, calculate the sum of 92/54 and 90/13, then from the result take away 46/41. What's the result as a simplified fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, calculate the sum of 92/54 and 90/13.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 54 and 13 is 54 \* 13 = &lt;&lt;54\*13=702&gt;&gt;702.
So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:
92/54 = (92 \* 13) / (54 \* 13) = &lt;&lt;92\*13=1196&gt;&gt;1196 / 702
90/13 = (90 \* 54) / (13 \* 54) = &lt;&lt;90\*54=4860&gt;&gt;4860 / 702
Now, we can add the fractions:
1196/702 + 4860/702 = (1196 + 4860) / 702 = &lt;&lt;1196+4860=6056&gt;&gt;6056 / 702
Next, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 6056 and 702 is 2.
So, we divide both numbers by 2:
6056 / 2 = &lt;&lt;6056/2=3028&gt;&gt;3028
702 / 2 = &lt;&lt;702/2=351&gt;&gt;351
Now, we have the simplified fraction: 3028/351
Finally, we subtract 46/41 from this fraction.
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 351 and 41 is 351 \* 41 = &lt;&lt;351\*41=14391&gt;&gt;14391.
So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:
3028/351 = (3028 \* 41) / (351 \* 41) = &lt;&lt;3028\*41=124148&gt;&gt;124148 / 14391
46/41 = (46 \* 351) / (41 \* 351) = &lt;&lt;46\*351=16186&gt;&gt;16186 / 14391
Now, we can subtract the fractions:
124148/14391 - 16186/14391 = (124148 - 16186) / 14391 = &lt;&lt;124148-16186=107962&gt;&gt;107962 / 14391
Now, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 107962 and 14391 is 1.
So, the fraction is already in its simplest form: 107962/14391.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 72 is 360.

29/20 = (29\*18)/(20\*18) = 522/360

17/72 = (17\*5)/(72\*5) = 85/360

Now we can add the two fractions:

522/360 + 85/360 = (522+85)/360 = 607/360

The fraction 607/360 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. Therefore, the sum of 29/20 and 17/72 is 607/360.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The sum of 29/20 and 17/72 is 607/360.

To subtract 9/68 from this sum, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 360 and 68 is 11040.

607/360 = (607\*30)/(360\*30) = 18210/11040

9/68 = (9\*162)/(68\*162) = 1458/11040

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

18210/11040 - 1458/11040 = (18210-1458)/11040 = 16752/11040

The fraction 16752/11040 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12. Therefore, the new value is 1404/920.

        Calculate the following, and express the result as a simplified fraction: ((21 / 75) + (74 / 43)) + (10 / 62)
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 75, 43, and 62 is 20225.

(21 / 75) = (21 * 270) / (75 * 270) = 5670 / 20225
(74 / 43) = (74 * 470) / (43 * 470) = 34780 / 20225
(10 / 62) = (10 * 326) / (62 * 326) = 3260 / 20225

Now, we can add the fractions:

(5670 / 20225) + (34780 / 20225) + (3260 / 20225) = (5670 + 34780 + 3260) / 20225 = 43710 / 20225

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.

(43710 / 20225) / (5 / 5) = 8742 / 4045

Therefore, the result is 8742 / 4045.

To reduce the fraction to its lowest term, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 9921 and 4026 is 3.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find the value of t by adding the two fractions:

t = 53/18 + 21/99

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 99 is 198. So we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

t = (53 * 11)/(18 * 11) + (21 * 2)/(99 * 2)
t = 583/198 + 42/198
t = (583 + 42)/198
t = 625/198

Now that we have the value of t, we can find the total sum, l, of the two identical fractions:

l = t + t
l = 625/198 + 625/198
l = (625 + 625)/198
l = 1250/198

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 1250 and 198 is 2. So we divide both by 2:

l = (1250/2) / (198/2)
l = 625/99

c = l + 99/92

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 99 and 92 is 891. So we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

c = (625 * 92)/(99 * 92) + (99 * 10)/(92 * 10)
c = 57500/891 + 990/891
c = (57500 + 990)/891
c = 58490/891

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 58490 and 891 is 1. So the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Therefore, the total sum of the two identical fractions and the fraction 99/92 is 58490/891.

Now, suppose that each fraction was instead equal to the sum of 76/18 and 21/99. You add these two identical fractions together to get a new total, which we will call w. What is w expressed as a simple fraction?

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, let's find the value of the new fraction by adding the two fractions:

t = 76/18 + 21/99

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 99 is 198. So we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

t = (76 * 11)/(18 * 11) + (21 * 2)/(99 * 2)
t = 836/198 + 42/198
t = (836 + 42)/198
t = 878/198

Now that we have the value of t, we can find the total sum, w, of the two identical fractions:

w = t + t
w = 878/198 + 878/198
w = (878 + 878)/198
w = 1756/198

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 1756 and 198 is 2. So we divide both by 2:

w = (1756/2) / (198/2)
w = 878/99

Therefore, the total sum of the two identical fractions is 878/99.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, calculate the result of 58/49 + 31/34.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 49 and 34 is 1666.
So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:
58/49 = (58 \* 34)/(49 \* 34) = 1972/1666
31/34 = (31 \* 49)/(34 \* 49) = 1519/1666
Now, we can add the fractions:
1972/1666 + 1519/1666 = (1972 + 1519)/1666 = 3491/1666
Next, add that result to the fraction 74/38.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1666 and 38 is 1666.
So, we convert the fraction 74/38 to have the same denominator:
74/38 = (74 \* 44)/(38 \* 44) = 3256/1666
Now, we can add the fractions:
3491/1666 + 3256/1666 = (3491 + 3256)/1666 = 6747/1666
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.
So, the final result is 6747/1666.

Olivia has read the same amount as Evan, which is also 51/18 of her novel.
After reading the same amount as Evan, Olivia has read an additional (8/42) of her novel.
To find out how much of the novel Olivia has read in total, we need to add the two fractions together:
51/18 + 8/42 = (51/18) \* (42/42) + (8/42) \* (18/18) = (51 \* 42)/(18 \* 42) + (8 \* 18)/(42 \* 18) = (2142 + 144)/(756) = 2286/756
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:

To find out how much of the novel Evan has read now, we need to add the amount he has already read to the amount Olivia has read in total:
51/18 + 381/126 = (51/18) \* (126/126) + (381/126) \* (18/18) = (51 \* 126)/(18 \* 126) + (381 \* 18)/(126 \* 18) = (6426 + 6858)/(2268) = 13284/2268

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, we find the value of 24/86 + 76/77.

Next, we subtract this value from 27/6.
27/6 = &lt;&lt;27/6=4.5&gt;&gt;4.5
27/6 - (24/86 + 76/77) = 4.5 - 1.26608275445484747800329105678042 = &lt;&lt;4.5-1.26608275445484747800329105678042=3.23391724554515252199670894321958&gt;&gt;3.23391724554515252199670894321958

First, we find the value of 24/86 + 76/77.

24/86 + 76/77 = 0.27906976744186046511627906976744 + 0.98701298701298701298701298701298 = &lt;&lt;0.27906976744186046511627906976744+0.98701298701298701298701298701298=1.26608275445484747800329105678042&gt;&gt;1.26608275445484747800329105678042
Next, we subtract this value from 27/6.
27/6 = &lt;&lt;27/6=4.5&gt;&gt;4.5
27/6 - (24/86 + 76/77) = 4.5 - 1.26608275445484747800329105678042 = &lt;&lt;4.5-1.26608275445484747800329105678042=3.23391724554515252199670894321958&gt;&gt;3.23391724554515252199670894321958
Now, we subtract the original value of 24/86 + 76/77 from our most recent answer.
3.23391724554515252199670894321958 - (24/86 + 76/77) = 3.23391724554515252199670894321958 - 1.26608275445484747800329105678042 = &lt;&lt;3.23391724554515252199670894321958-1.26608275445484747800329105678042=1.96783449109030504399341788643916&gt;&gt;1.96783449109030504399341788643916
To simplify this answer to the lowest terms, we can see that the decimal repeats after the 14th digit, so we can round it to the nearest hundredth.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 73/39 and 49/14, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 39 and 14 is 133.

73/39 = (73 \* 3)/(39 \* 3) = 219/117
49/14 = (49 \* 9)/(14 \* 9) = 441/126

Now we can add the two fractions:

219/117 + 441/126 = (219 \* 126)/(117 \* 126) + (441 \* 117)/(126 \* 117) = (27594 + 51597)/(14742) = 79191/14742

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

79191/14742 = (79191/3)/(14742/3) = 26397/4914

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The sum of 73/39 and 49/14 is 26397/4914.

To add this result to 21/80, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4914 and 80 is 393120.

26397/4914 = (26397 \* 80)/(4914 \* 80) = 2111760/393120
21/80 = (21 \* 4914)/(80 \* 4914) = 103209/393120

Now we can add the two fractions:

2111760/393120 + 103209/393120 = (2111760 + 103209)/393120 = 2214969/393120

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

2214969/393120 = (2214969/3)/(393120/3) = 738323/131040

73/6 = (73 \* 7)/(6 \* 7) = 511/42
49/14 = (49 \* 3)/(14 \* 3) = 147/42

Now we can add the two fractions:

511/42 + 147/42 = (511 + 147)/42 = 658/42

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

7/39 = (7 \* 65)/(39 \* 65) = 455/2535

Now we can add the two fractions:

2925/2535 + 455/2535 = (2925 + 455)/2535 = 3380/2535

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We previously found that the sum of 75/65 and 7/39 is 676/507.

Now we need to add the fraction 65/97 to this result. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 507 and 97 is 49179.

676/507 = (676 \* 97)/(507 \* 97) = 65612/49179

65/97 = (65 \* 507)/(97 \* 507) = 32905/49179

Now we can add the two fractions:

65612/49179 + 32905/49179 = (65612 + 32905)/49179 = 98517/49179

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

        If Alex has 69/63 gallons of orange juice and he bought additional 77/5 gallons, giving him a total of 'k' gallons. Later, he received another 47/71 gallons of orange juice from Sally. How many gallons did Alex have in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, let's find the total amount of orange juice Alex had after buying additional orange juice.

Alex had 69/63 + 77/5 = &lt;&lt;69/63+77/5=1.1+15.4=16.5&gt;&gt;16.5 gallons of orange juice.

Then, Alex received another 47/71 gallons from Sally.

So, the total amount of orange juice Alex had is 16.5 + 47/71 = &lt;&lt;16.5+47/71=16.5+0.662=17.162&gt;&gt;17.162 gallons.

Since we are looking for the total amount of orange juice Alex had in gallons, we can round the answer to the nearest hundredth.

        What is the result of ((100 / 61) + ((39 / 6) + (67 / 49)))? Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, we simplify the fractions inside the parentheses:
(100 / 61) = &lt;&lt;100/61=100/61&gt;&gt;100/61
(39 / 6) = &lt;&lt;39/6=13/2&gt;&gt;13/2
(67 / 49) = &lt;&lt;67/49=67/49&gt;&gt;67/49

Next, we add the fractions inside the parentheses:
(13/2) + (67/49) = (637/98) + (67/49) = (637+67)/98 = &lt;&lt;(637+67)/98=704/98&gt;&gt;704/98

Finally, we add the result to the first fraction:
(100/61) + (704/98) = (9800/5958) + (704/98) = (9800+704)/5958 = &lt;&lt;(9800+704)/5958=10504/5958&gt;&gt;10504/5958

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
10504/5958 = (10504/2)/(5958/2) = &lt;&lt;(10504/2)/(5958/2)=5252/2979&gt;&gt;5252/2979

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 86 is 104.

92/13 = (92 * 8) / (13 * 8) = 736/104
43/86 = (43 * 1) / (86 * 1) = 43/104

Now we can add the two fractions:

736/104 + 43/104 = (736 + 43) / 104 = 779/104

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 32 and 98 is 224.

67/32 = (67\*7)/(32\*7) = 469/224

10/98 = (10\*2)/(98\*2) = 20/196 = (20\*1)/(196\*1) = 20/224

Now we can add the two fractions:

469/224 + 20/224 = (469+20)/224 = 489/224

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 52 and 32 is 1664.

59/52 = (59\*32)/(52\*32) = 1888/1664

70/32 = (70\*52)/(32\*52) = 3640/1664

Now we can add the two fractions:

1888/1664 + 3640/1664 = (1888+3640)/1664 = 5528/1664

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 16:

5528/1664 = (5528/16)/(1664/16) = 346/104

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 52 and 82 is 2124.

20/52 = (20 \* 41)/(52 \* 41) = 820/2124
75/82 = (75 \* 26)/(82 \* 26) = 1950/2124

Now we can add the two fractions:

820/2124 + 1950/2124 = (820 + 1950)/2124 = 2770/2124

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 26.

2770/2124 = (2770/26)/(2124/26) = 106.53846153846154/81.69230769230769

Since we are looking for the smallest possible fraction, we can round the decimal to the nearest whole number.

106.53846153846154 ≈ 107
81.69230769230769 ≈ 82

So the simplified fraction is 107/82.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 84 and 5 is 420.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

92/84 = (92 \* 5) / (84 \* 5) = 460/420

31/5 = (31 \* 84) / (5 \* 84) = 2604/420

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:

2604/420 - 460/420 = (2604 - 460) / 420 = 2144/420

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8:

2144/420 = (2144/8) / (420/8) = 268/52.5

Since 52.5 is not an integer, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get an integer denominator:

268/52.5 = (268 \* 2) / (52.5 \* 2) = 536/105

Therefore, the result of subtracting 92/84 from 31/5 is 536/105.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can follow the same steps as before, but this time we subtract 67/84 instead of 92/84.

First, we find a common denominator for the two fractions, which is 420.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

67/84 = (67 \* 5) / (84 \* 5) = 335/420

31/5 = (31 \* 84) / (5 \* 84) = 2604/420

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:

2604/420 - 335/420 = (2604 - 335) / 420 = 2269/420

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

2269/420 = (2269/1) / (420/1) = 2269/420

Therefore, the result of subtracting 67/84 from 31/5 is 2269/420.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 21 and 92 is 644.

69/21 = (69 \* 31)/(21 \* 31) = 2139/644

10/92 = (10 \* 7)/(92 \* 7) = 70/644

Now, we can find the difference between the two fractions:

2139/644 - 70/644 = (2139 - 70)/644 = 2069/644

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

Therefore, the difference between 69/21 and 10/92 is 2069/644.

Next, add the fractions together:
1.1818181818181819 + 4.666666666666667 + 2.6470588235294117 = &lt;&lt;1.1818181818181819+4.666666666666667+2.6470588235294117=8.495543671914259&gt;&gt;8.495543671914259 (rounded to 12 decimal places)
Finally, convert the decimal to a fraction:
8.495543671914259 = &lt;&lt;8.495543671914259*1000000000000=8495543671914259&gt;&gt;8495543671914259/1000000000000 (rounded to 12 decimal places)

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To calculate (12 / 7) - (9 / 23), we first find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 7 and 23 is 161.

(12 / 7) = (12 * 23) / (7 * 23) = 276 / 161
(9 / 23) = (9 * 7) / (23 * 7) = 63 / 161

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

(276 / 161) - (63 / 161) = (276 - 63) / 161 = 213 / 161

The fraction 213 / 161 is already in its simplest form, as 213 and 161 have no common factors other than 1.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: From the previous question, we found that t = 213 / 161.

Now we need to calculate (40 / 11) - t.

First, we find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 11 and 161 is 1771.

(40 / 11) = (40 * 161) / (11 * 161) = 6440 / 1771
(213 / 161) = (213 * 11) / (161 * 11) = 2343 / 1771

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

(6440 / 1771) - (2343 / 1771) = (6440 - 2343) / 1771 = 4097 / 1771

The fraction 4097 / 1771 is not in its simplest form, as both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by 11.

4097 / 11 = 372.45454545454544
1771 / 11 = 161

So the simplified fraction is 372.45454545454544 / 161.

        In the previous problem, you calculated (12 / 7) - (9 / 23) which accounted for certain quantities of two different fruits. Now suppose you actually had 12/7th of a crate of oranges but only 9/48th of a crate of apples. In that case, what would be the resulting difference in fractions between the two fruit quantities?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: In this case, we have 12/7th of a crate of oranges and 9/48th of a crate of apples. To find the difference between the two quantities, we first simplify the fraction for the apples:

(9 / 48) = (9 / (9 * 5)) = 1 / 5

Now we can find the difference between the two fractions:

(12 / 7) - (1 / 5)

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 5 is 35.

(12 / 7) = (12 * 5) / (7 * 5) = 60 / 35
(1 / 5) = (1 * 7) / (5 * 7) = 7 / 35

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

(60 / 35) - (7 / 35) = (60 - 7) / 35 = 53 / 35

The fraction 53 / 35 is already in its simplest form, as 53 and 35 have no common factors other than 1.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 61 is 1098.

95/18 = (95 \* 61) / (18 \* 61) = 5795 / 1098

51/61 = (51 \* 18) / (61 \* 18) = 918 / 1098

Now we can add the two fractions:

5795/1098 + 918/1098 = (5795 + 918) / 1098 = 6713 / 1098

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 13.

6713 / 1098 = (6713 / 13) / (1098 / 13) = 516 / 84

We can simplify this fraction further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4.

516 / 84 = (516 / 4) / (84 / 4) = 129 / 21

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To subtract the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 46 and 84 is 23 * 4 = 92.

(93 / 46) = (93 * 2) / (46 * 2) = 186 / 92
(51 / 84) = (51 * 1) / (84 * 1) = 51 / 92

Now we can subtract the fractions:

186 / 92 - 51 / 92 = (186 - 51) / 92 = 135 / 92

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

135 / 3 = 45
92 / 3 = 30.666...

Since the denominator cannot be a decimal, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3 to get rid of the decimal:

45 * 3 = 135
30.666... * 3 = 92

So the simplified fraction is 135 / 92.

84/9 = (84 * 70) / (9 * 70) = 5880/630

Now we can add the fractions:

108/630 + 5880/630 = (108 + 5880) / 630 = 5988/630

998/105 = (998 * 86) / (105 * 86) = 85828/9030
21/86 = (21 * 105) / (86 * 105) = 2205/9030

        What is the sum of 91/76 and 12/22? Please simplify your fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 76 and 22 is 184.

91/76 = (91\*2)/(76\*2) = 182/152
12/22 = (12\*8)/(22\*8) = 96/176

Now we can add the two fractions:

182/152 + 96/176 = (182\*176)/(152\*176) + (96\*152)/(176\*152) = (32032+14688)/(26880) = 46720/26880

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 160:

46720/26880 = (46720/160)/(26880/160) = 292/168

We can simplify this fraction further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

292/168 = (292/4)/(168/4) = 73/42

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 93, 47, and 4 is 186.

88/93 = (88 * 2) / (93 * 2) = 176/186
6/47 = (6 * 4) / (47 * 4) = 24/186

Now, add the two fractions:

176/186 + 24/186 = (176 + 24) / 186 = 200/186

Next, convert 92/4 to have the same denominator:

92/4 = (92 * 46.5) / (4 * 46.5) = 4260/186

Now, add the two results:

200/186 + 4260/186 = (200 + 4260) / 186 = 4460/186

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the sum of 52/21 and 75/67.
52/21 + 75/67 = (52\*67 + 75\*21) / (21\*67) = (3484 + 1575) / (1407) = 5059 / 1407
Now, we can add this result to 95/83.
95/83 + 5059/1407 = (95\*1407 + 5059\*83) / (83\*1407) = (133665 + 420717) / (116121) = 554382 / 116121
To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 554382 and 116121 is 3.
So, the simplified fraction is 554382/3 / 116121/3 = 184794 / 38707

        What is the value of the expression ((73 / 27) - (23 / 48))? Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The expression can be simplified by finding the common denominator of 27 and 48, which is 216.

(73 / 27) = (73 * 8) / (27 * 8) = 584 / 216

(23 / 48) = (23 * 4.5) / (48 * 4.5) = 103.5 / 216

Now, subtract the two fractions:

584 / 216 - 103.5 / 216 = (584 - 103.5) / 216 = 480.5 / 216

The fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 108.

480.5 / 216 = (480.5 / 108) / (216 / 108) = 4.45 / 2

Therefore, the value of the expression is 4.45 / 2.

Next, convert 53/4 to a mixed number, which is 13 1/4.
Now, add the decimal to the mixed number: 0.3505 + 13 1/4 = 13.3505.
Since the problem asks for a mixed number, we can convert 13.3505 to a mixed number by taking the whole number part (13) and the decimal part (0.3505).
The decimal part can be converted to a fraction by dividing it by 1: 0.3505/1 = 3505/10000.
Now, simplify the fraction: 3505/10000 = 701/2000.
So, the mixed number is 13 701/2000.

First, simplify the fractions:

92/95 is already in its simplest form.

4/74 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

4/74 = (4/2) / (74/2) = 2/37

Now, add the fractions:

(92/95) + (2/37)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 95 and 37 is 3515.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

(92/95) = (92 * 37) / (95 * 37) = 3404/3515

(2/37) = (2 * 95) / (37 * 95) = 190/3515

Now, add the fractions:

3404/3515 + 190/3515 = (3404 + 190) / 3515 = 3594/3515

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The value of 'v' is 69/47.
The value of 'd' is 88/72 + 69/47.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 72 and 47 is 3456.
So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:
88/72 = (88 \* 48) / (72 \* 48) = 4224/3456
69/47 = (69 \* 73) / (47 \* 73) = 5037/3456
Now we can add the fractions:
d = 4224/3456 + 5037/3456 = (4224 + 5037) / 3456 = 9261/3456

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of 85/75 and 88/56, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 75 and 56 is 2100.

85/75 = (85 \* 28)/(75 \* 28) = 2380/2100

88/56 = (88 \* 37.5)/(56 \* 37.5) = 3300/2100

Now we can add the two fractions:

2380/2100 + 3300/2100 = (2380 + 3300)/2100 = 5680/2100

To convert this fraction to decimal form, we divide 5680 by 2100:

5680/2100 = &lt;&lt;5680/2100=2.7047619047619047&gt;&gt;2.7047619047619047

        What is the result of adding 12 over 33 to 49 over 2? Write your answer as a mixed fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 33 and 2 is 66.

12/33 = (12*2)/(33*2) = 24/66
49/2 = (49*33)/(2*33) = 1617/66

Now we can add the two fractions:

24/66 + 1617/66 = (24+1617)/66 = 1641/66

To convert the improper fraction to a mixed fraction, we divide the numerator by the denominator:

1641 ÷ 66 = 24 with a remainder of 51

So the result is 24 51/66.

        After obtaining the result from the previous problem, where you added two fractions both equal to 78/65, what would you get if you add the result to 71/32?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add two fractions, you can find a common denominator and then add the numerators.
The common denominator of 65 and 32 is 65\*32 = &lt;&lt;65\*32=2080&gt;&gt;2080.
The first fraction, 156/65, becomes 156\*32/65\*32 = &lt;&lt;156\*32/65\*32=5088/2080&gt;&gt;5088/2080.
The second fraction, 71/32, becomes 71\*65/32\*65 = &lt;&lt;71\*65/32\*65=4615/2080&gt;&gt;4615/2080.
Adding the two fractions, 5088/2080 + 4615/2080 = (5088+4615)/2080 = &lt;&lt;(5088+4615)/2080=9703/2080&gt;&gt;9703/2080

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 90 is 630.

16/7 = (16 \* 90) / (7 \* 90) = 1440/630
11/90 = (11 \* 7) / (90 \* 7) = 77/630

Now we can add the two fractions:

1440/630 + 77/630 = (1440 + 77) / 630 = 1517/630

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

1517/630 is already in its simplest form.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We have already found that the sum of 16/7 and 11/90 is 1517/630.

Now we need to add this sum to 38/69.

To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 630 and 69 is 43470.

1517/630 = (1517 \* 69) / (630 \* 69) = 104653/43470
38/69 = (38 \* 630) / (69 \* 630) = 23940/43470

Now we can add the two fractions:

104653/43470 + 23940/43470 = (104653 + 23940) / 43470 = 128593/43470

99/90 = (99 \* 7) / (90 \* 7) = 693/630

Now we can add the two fractions:
