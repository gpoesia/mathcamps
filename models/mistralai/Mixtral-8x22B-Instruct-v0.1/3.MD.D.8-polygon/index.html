The total perimeter of the pentagon is 300cm, and the lengths of four of its sides are 70cm, 36cm, 53cm, and 45cm.
The length of the fifth side can be found by subtracting the sum of the lengths of the other four sides from the total perimeter.
The sum of the lengths of the four sides is 70+36+53+45 = &lt;&lt;70+36+53+45=204&gt;&gt;204cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.
The perimeter of a regular hexagon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
Therefore, the length of one side of the hexagon is 354m/6 = &lt;&lt;354/6=59&gt;&gt;59m.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total perimeter of the polygon is the sum of all its side lengths. We know the lengths of seven sides and the total perimeter, so we can find the length of the last unknown side by subtracting the sum of the known side lengths from the total perimeter.

The sum of the known side lengths is 59m + 16m + 15m + 35m + 89m + 16m + 43m = &lt;&lt;59+16+15+35+89+16+43=273&gt;&gt;273m.

The length of the last unknown side is the total perimeter minus the sum of the known side lengths, which is 286m - 273m = &lt;&lt;286-273=13&gt;&gt;13m.

Let the length of the sixth side be x meters.
The total perimeter of the hexagon is 380m, so we have:
9m + 49m + 100m + 73m + 84m + x = 380m
Simplifying, we get:
215m + x = 380m
Subtracting 215m from both sides, we get:
x = 380m - 215m
x = 165m

The sum of the given side lengths is 39m + 26m + 47m + 52m + 66m + 17m + 34m = &lt;&lt;39+26+47+52+66+17+34=281&gt;&gt;281m.
The overall perimeter of the polygon is 356m, so the length of the last side is 356m - 281m = &lt;&lt;356-281=75&gt;&gt;75m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a decagon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. We know the lengths of eight of the sides, so we can find the length of the ninth side by subtracting the sum of the known side lengths from the total perimeter.

The sum of the known side lengths is 24m + 25m + 75m + 38m + 18m + 42m + 61m = &lt;&lt;24+25+75+38+18+42+61=293&gt;&gt;293m.

The length of the ninth side is the total perimeter minus the sum of the known side lengths, which is 359m - 293m = &lt;&lt;359-293=66&gt;&gt;66m.
