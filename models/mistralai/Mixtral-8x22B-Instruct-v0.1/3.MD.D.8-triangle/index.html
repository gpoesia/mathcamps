So, 192 + 159 + x = 861

Combining the known side lengths, we get:

351 + x = 861

Subtracting 351 from both sides, we get:

x = 861 - 351

x = 510

The perimeter of the garden is given as 792m, so we have:

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 792m - 147m - 590m
x = 55m

Let x be the length of the third side.
Then, 321 + 528 + x = 871

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. Let's call the length of the third side x.

So, 424 + 246 + x = 991

Combining the known side lengths, we get:

670 + x = 991

Subtracting 670 from both sides, we get:

x = 991 - 670

x = 321

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 321m.

Let x be the length of the third side.
The perimeter is given as 762m, so we have:
131m + 147m + x = 762m
Solving for x, we get:
x = 762m - 131m - 147m = &lt;&lt;762-131-147=484&gt;&gt;484m

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. Let's call the length of the third side x.

The perimeter is given as 700m, so we have:
140m + 525m + x = 700m

Solving for x, we get:
x = 700m - 140m - 525m
x = 35m

So the length of the third side is 35m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. Let's denote the length of the third side as x.

According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Therefore, we have:

180 + 338 &gt; x

Also, the sum of the lengths of the three sides must equal the perimeter:

180 + 338 + x = 739

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 739 - (180 + 338)
x = 739 - 518
x = 221
