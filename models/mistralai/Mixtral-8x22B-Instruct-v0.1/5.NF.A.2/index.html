        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Johnnie the monkey was given 18/7 + 12/14 bananas.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 14 is 14.
So, we convert 18/7 to 36/14 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2.
Now, we can add the two fractions: 36/14 + 12/14 = (36+12)/14 = 48/14.
We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.
So, Johnnie the monkey was given 48/14 Ã· 2/2 = 24/7 bananas in total.

The zookeeper decides to give Johnnie the same total amount of bananas the next day, so Johnnie receives another 24/7 bananas on the second day.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total portion of the treasure map that Captain Silverbeard found, we need to add the two fractions together. However, since they have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator first.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 19 is 247.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

10/13 = (10 \* 19)/(13 \* 19) = 190/247

16/19 = (16 \* 13)/(19 \* 13) = 208/247

Now, we can add the two fractions together:

190/247 + 208/247 = (190 + 208)/247 = 398/247

Therefore, Captain Silverbeard found 398/247 of the treasure map.

To find the total portion of the treasure map that Captain Silverbeard has now, we need to add the two fractions together. However, since they have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator first.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 247 and 17 is 4199.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

398/247 = (398 \* 17)/(247 \* 17) = 6766/4199

15/17 = (15 \* 247)/(17 \* 247) = 3705/4199

Now, we can add the two fractions together:

6766/4199 + 3705/4199 = (6766 + 3705)/4199 = 10471/4199

Therefore, Captain Silverbeard has 10471/4199 of the treasure map now.

            Suppose instead of finding 10/13 of the treasure map at the first shipwreck site, Captain Silverbeard found a larger piece which was 10/9 of the total map. Keeping the second portion from the other shipwreck site the same at 16/19, what is the total portion of the treasure map that he found now?

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Since Captain Silverbeard found 10/9 of the treasure map at the first shipwreck site, this means that he found more than the entire map. However, since we are looking for the total portion of the map that he found, we can still add the two fractions together.

The second portion of the map that he found is still 16/19.

To add the two fractions together, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 19 is 171.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

10/9 = (10 \* 19)/(9 \* 19) = 190/171

16/19 = (16 \* 9)/(19 \* 9) = 144/171

Now, we can add the two fractions together:

190/171 + 144/171 = (190 + 144)/171 = 334/171

Therefore, Captain Silverbeard found 334/171 of the treasure map.

            In a park, 10 ducks are equally distributed among 5 ponds, implying each pond has 10 / 5 ducks. In the same park, 8 fish are distributed among 10 small pools, with each pool having 8 / 10 fish. How many animals are there in each pond and pool combined?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Each pond has 10 / 5 = &lt;&lt;10/5=2&gt;&gt;2 ducks.
Each pool has 8 / 10 = &lt;&lt;8/10=0.8&gt;&gt;0.8 fish.
Since we cannot have a fraction of a fish, we can assume that the fish are not evenly distributed among the pools, and some pools may have 1 fish while others have none. However, since the question asks for the total number of animals in each pond and pool combined, we can ignore this discrepancy and simply add the total number of ducks and fish together.
There are 10 ducks + 8 fish = &lt;&lt;10+8=18&gt;&gt;18 animals in total.
Since there are 5 ponds and 10 pools, there are 5 + 10 = &lt;&lt;5+10=15&gt;&gt;15 ponds and pools combined.
Therefore, there are 18 / 15 = &lt;&lt;18/15=1.2&gt;&gt;1.2 animals in each pond and pool combined.
Since we cannot have a fraction of an animal, we can assume that some ponds and pools have more animals than others. However, since the question asks for the average number of animals in each pond and pool combined, we can round this number to the nearest whole number.
### Answer: 1 animal in each pond and pool combined.</pre>

Albert collects another full set of 4/1 = &lt;&lt;4/1=4&gt;&gt;4 cards.
Albert now has 1.1764705882352941 + 4 = &lt;&lt;1.1764705882352941+4=5.176470588235294&gt;&gt;5.176470588235294 full sets of cards.
Since Albert cannot have a fraction of a full set, we round down to the nearest whole number.
Albert now has 5 full sets of cards.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: John watched the movie for 10/12 = &lt;&lt;10/12=5/6&gt;&gt;5/6 of an hour and the TV show for 3/8 = &lt;&lt;3/8=3/8&gt;&gt;3/8 of an hour.
The total time he spent watching is 5/6 + 3/8 = &lt;&lt;(5/6)+(3/8)=(20/24)+(9/24)=29/24&gt;&gt;29/24 hours.
Since 24/24 = 1 hour, 29/24 = 1 hour and 5/24 of an hour.
To convert 5/24 of an hour to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 5/24 \* 60 = &lt;&lt;(5/24)\*60=125/4=31.25&gt;&gt;31.25 minutes.
Therefore, John spent a total of 1 hour and 31.25 minutes watching.

            Bob has 11/3 dollars in one pocket of his wallet and 12/19 dollars in another pocket. How much money does he have in total in his wallet?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total amount of money Bob has in his wallet, we need to add the amounts in both pockets.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 3 and 19 is 57.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

11/3 = (11 \* 19)/(3 \* 19) = 209/57

12/19 = (12 \* 3)/(19 \* 3) = 36/57

Now, we can add the two amounts:

209/57 + 36/57 = (209 + 36)/57 = 245/57

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

245/57 = 245/57

So, Bob has 245/57 dollars in his wallet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: If Bob starts out with 3/3 dollars in one pocket, that is equivalent to having 1 dollar.

So, Bob has 1 + 12/19 dollars in his wallet.

To find the total amount of money Bob has in his wallet, we need to add the amounts in both pockets.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 1 and 19 is 19.

So, we convert the whole number to a fraction with the same denominator:

1 = 19/19

Now, we can add the two amounts:

19/19 + 12/19 = (19 + 12)/19 = 31/19

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The area of the large tent is 13/11 acres and the area of the smaller tent is 8/20 acres. To find the total area occupied by both tents, we need to add the two areas together.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 11 and 20 is 220.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

13/11 = (13 \* 20)/(11 \* 20) = 260/220

8/20 = (8 \* 11)/(20 \* 11) = 88/220

Now, we can add the two fractions together:

260/220 + 88/220 = (260 + 88)/220 = 348/220

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

348/220 = (348/2)/(220/2) = 174/110

So, the total area occupied by both tents is 174/110 acres.

8/20 = (8 \* 11)/(20 \* 11) = 88/220

1/10 = (1 \* 22)/(10 \* 22) = 22/220

Now, we can add the three fractions together:

260/220 + 88/220 + 22/220 = (260 + 88 + 22)/220 = 370/220

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:

Instead, if John had a different small tent that occupied an area of 10/20 acres, what would be the total area occupied by these tents?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The area of the large tent is 13/11 acres and the area of the smaller tent is 10/20 acres. To find the total area occupied by both tents, we need to add the two areas together.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 11 and 20 is 220.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

13/11 = (13 \* 20)/(11 \* 20) = 260/220

10/20 = (10 \* 11)/(20 \* 11) = 110/220

Now, we can add the two fractions together:

260/220 + 110/220 = (260 + 110)/220 = 370/220

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:

370/220 = (370/10)/(220/10) = 37/22

So, the total area occupied by both tents is 37/22 acres.

            During a rainy day, the first rainfall lasted for 4/13 hours, and the next rainfall was a little longer and lasted for 11/5 hours. How many hours did it rain in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The first rainfall lasted for 4/13 hours, and the second rainfall lasted for 11/5 hours.
To find the total time it rained, we need to add the two fractions together.
First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 13 and 5 is 65.
So, we convert the first fraction to have a denominator of 65: 4/13 = (4 \* 5)/(13 \* 5) = 20/65
And we convert the second fraction to have a denominator of 65: 11/5 = (11 \* 13)/(5 \* 13) = 143/65
Now we can add the two fractions together: 20/65 + 143/65 = (20 + 143)/65 = 163/65
To convert this fraction to a mixed number, we divide 163 by 65: 163 Ã· 65 = 2 remainder 48
So, the total time it rained is 2 hours and 48/65 hours.
Since 48/65 is less than 1, we can convert it to a decimal: 48/65 â‰ˆ 0.738
So, the total time it rained is approximately 2.738 hours.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total cord of wood burned in a day, we need to add the amount burned in the morning and the amount burned in the evening.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 17 and 19 is 323.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

12/17 = (12 \* 19)/(17 \* 19) = 228/323

8/19 = (8 \* 17)/(19 \* 17) = 136/323

Now, we can add the two fractions:

228/323 + 136/323 = (228 + 136)/323 = 364/323

So, the fireplace burns 364/323 cord of wood in a day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total cord of wood burned in one full day, we need to add the amount burned during the day and the amount burned at night.

We already know that the fireplace burns 364/323 cord of wood during the day.

Now, we need to add the amount burned at night:

19/20 cord of wood

To add the two amounts, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 323 and 20 is 6460.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

364/323 = (364 \* 20)/(323 \* 20) = 7280/6460

19/20 = (19 \* 323)/(20 \* 323) = 6137/6460

Now, we can add the two fractions:

7280/6460 + 6137/6460 = (7280 + 6137)/6460 = 13417/6460

So, the fireplace burns 13417/6460 cord of wood in one full day.

To find the total length of the flight, we need to add the lengths of the two segments.
The first segment is 18/19 and the second segment is 9/17.
To add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 19 and 17 is 323.
So, we convert the first fraction to 18/19 \* 17/17 = 306/323 and the second fraction to 9/17 \* 19/19 = 171/323.
Now, we can add the two fractions: 306/323 + 171/323 = 477/323.
To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.
So, the total length of the flight is 477/323 miles.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The butterfly has already flown 477/323 miles in the first two segments.
The third segment is 19/20 of a mile.
To find the total distance, we need to add the length of the third segment to the total distance of the first two segments.
The third segment is 19/20 and the total distance of the first two segments is 477/323.
To add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 323 is 6460.
So, we convert the first fraction to 477/323 \* 20/20 = 9540/6460 and the second fraction to 19/20 \* 323/323 = 6137/6460.
Now, we can add the two fractions: 9540/6460 + 6137/6460 = 15677/6460.
To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

The second segment remained 9/17 of a mile.
To find the total length of the flight, we need to add the lengths of the two segments.
The first segment is 3/2 and the second segment is 9/17.
To add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 17 is 34.
So, we convert the first fraction to 3/2 \* 17/17 = 51/34 and the second fraction to 9/17 \* 2/2 = 18/34.
Now, we can add the two fractions: 51/34 + 18/34 = 69/34.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The child went down a slide that's 6/19 meters long and another slide that's 17/4 meters long.
To find the total length of the slides, we need to add the lengths of both slides together.
First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 19 and 4 is 76.
So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:
6/19 = (6*4)/(19*4) = 24/76
17/4 = (17*19)/(4*19) = 323/76
Now, we can add the two fractions together:
24/76 + 323/76 = (24+323)/76 = 347/76
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.
So, the child went down a total of 347/76 = &lt;&lt;347/76=4.5657894736842105&gt;&gt;4.5657894736842105 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Bob has 10/2 = &lt;&lt;10/2=5&gt;&gt;5 halves of a cucumber, which is equivalent to 5 whole cucumbers.
Bob adds 1/7 of another cucumber, which is equivalent to 1/7 of a whole cucumber.
Bob has 5 + 1/7 = &lt;&lt;5+(1/7)=36/7&gt;&gt;36/7 cucumbers in total.

            Suppose instead of 1/7 of a cucumber, Bob initially has 17/7 (or about 2 and a half) cucumbers before adding 10/2. How many cucumbers does he have now?

Bob adds 10/2 = &lt;&lt;10/2=5&gt;&gt;5 halves of a cucumber, which is equivalent to 5 whole cucumbers.
Bob has 2.4285714285714284 + 5 = &lt;&lt;2.4285714285714284+5=7.428571428571428&gt;&gt;7.428571428571428 cucumbers in total.
