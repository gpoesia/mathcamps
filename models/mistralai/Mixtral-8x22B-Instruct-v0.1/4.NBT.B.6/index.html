        There are 535 fish in a large tank and a shark eats 461 of them in one sitting. If the shark continues this pattern and only eats when there are 461 or more fish to consume, how many fish will be leftover after its dinner?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The shark eats 461 fish in one sitting, so there will be 535-461 = &lt;&lt;535-461=74&gt;&gt;74 fish leftover after its first dinner.
Since the shark only eats when there are 461 or more fish to consume, it will not eat any more fish after its first dinner.

Since the builder can't install a fraction of a tile, they will install 1 tile completely and the last tile will need to cover the remaining area.
The remaining area is 660 - (1 \* 335) = &lt;&lt;660-(1\*335)=325&gt;&gt;325 square feet.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The factory produced 979 toy cars and packed them into boxes containing 108 cars each.
To find out how many boxes they can fill, we divide the total number of cars by the number of cars per box: 979/108 = &lt;&lt;979/108=9&gt;&gt;9 boxes with 108 cars each.
To find out how many cars will be left unpacked, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of cars per box and subtract that from the total number of cars: 9*108 = &lt;&lt;9*108=972&gt;&gt;972 cars packed, 979-972 = &lt;&lt;979-972=7&gt;&gt;7 cars left unpacked.

The hat shop will have 830 - (2 \* 421) = &lt;&lt;830-(2\*421)=-1&gt;&gt;830 - 842 = -11 hats left over. However, since it is not possible to have a negative number of hats, this means that the hat shop will not have enough hats to make a third box.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total number of members is 759, and the telescope can handle 228 people each night.
To find out how many nights are needed, we divide the total number of members by the number of people that can view each night: 759/228 = &lt;&lt;759/228=3.328069767441767&gt;&gt;3.328069767441767.
Since we can't have a fraction of a night, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 nights.
To find out how many people will view the event on the final night, we subtract the number of people that can view each night from the total number of members: 759 - (228*3) = &lt;&lt;759-(228*3)=87&gt;&gt;87.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many flies are left, we need to know how many jumps the frog made. Since the number of flies eaten by the frog in each jump is a multiple of 258, we can divide the total number of flies by 258 to find out how many jumps the frog made.

941 / 258 = &lt;&lt;941/258=3.647286516396123&gt;&gt;3 with a remainder of 197.

This means that the frog made 3 jumps and ate 3 \* 258 = &lt;&lt;3\*258=774&gt;&gt;774 flies.

Therefore, there are 941 - 774 = &lt;&lt;941-774=167&gt;&gt;167 flies left.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total number of spaces is 991, and there are 66 rows. To find out how many spaces are in each row, we divide the total number of spaces by the number of rows: 991/66 = &lt;&lt;991/66=15.015151515151515&gt;&gt;15.015151515151515. Since we can't have a fraction of a space, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 15.

Now, to find out how many spare spaces there will be in the last row, we multiply the number of rows by the number of spaces per row and subtract that from the total number of spaces: 66*15 = &lt;&lt;66\*15=990&gt;&gt;990.

So, there will be 991 - 990 = &lt;&lt;991-990=1&gt;&gt;1 spare space in the last row.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total number of spaces is still 991, but now there are 471 spaces in each row. To find out how many rows there are, we divide the total number of spaces by the number of spaces per row: 991/471 = &lt;&lt;991/471=2.104033970275966&gt;&gt;2.104033970275966. Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2.

Now, to find out how many spare spaces there will be in the last row, we multiply the number of rows by the number of spaces per row and subtract that from the total number of spaces: 2*471 = &lt;&lt;2\*471=942&gt;&gt;942.

So, there will be 991 - 942 = &lt;&lt;991-942=49&gt;&gt;49 spare spaces in the last row.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

Since the amount of water per bottle is not a whole number, there will be some water that can't be distributed evenly.
To find out how much water overflows, we can multiply the number of bottles by the whole number part of the amount of water per bottle, and then subtract that from the total amount of water.
167 bottles \* 1 liter = &lt;&lt;167\*1=167&gt;&gt;167 liters.

The number of campers that can be accommodated in 2 tents is 2*445 = &lt;&lt;2\*445=890&gt;&gt;890.
The number of campers left over after all the tents are filled is 533-890 = &lt;&lt;533-890=-357&gt;&gt;-357. However, since we can't have a negative number of campers, this means that there are not enough tents to accommodate all the campers.

        Now suppose that the park upgraded their tents and each tent can now host 886 people. With the same group of 533 campers, how many campers will be left over after all the tents are filled?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of tents needed to accommodate all the campers is 533/886 = &lt;&lt;533/886=0.6014634146341463&gt;&gt;0.6014634146341463. Since we can't have a fraction of a tent, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 1 tent.
The number of campers that can be accommodated in 1 tent is 886.
The number of campers left over after all the tents are filled is 533-886 = &lt;&lt;533-886=-353&gt;&gt;-353. However, since we can't have a negative number of campers, this means that there are not enough campers to fill the tent.
Therefore, the number of campers left over after all the tents are filled is 0.

        In the same castle's garden, there were originally 984 roses, but the princess has decided to use only 730 roses for each tribute to her loyal subjects instead of the previous 426. Now, if she distributes roses evenly to create as many tributes as possible, how many roses will be left undistributed in the castle's garden?

        Unicorn Village, a magical place where 265 unicorns live, is divided into 146 equal sections where these magical creatures reside. If each section is occupied by an equal number of unicorns, how many unicorns will live in the last incomplete section?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Since the total number of unicorns (265) is not a multiple of the number of sections (146), there will be an incomplete section.

First, we need to find out how many unicorns live in each complete section. To do this, we divide the total number of unicorns by the number of sections: 265 / 146 = &lt;&lt;265/146=1.8150684931506848&gt;&gt;1.8150684931506848 (approximately).

Since we can't have a fraction of a unicorn, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 unicorn per complete section.

Now, we need to find out how many unicorns will be in the incomplete section. To do this, we multiply the number of complete sections by the number of unicorns per complete section: 145 * 1 = &lt;&lt;145*1=145&gt;&gt;145 unicorns.

Finally, we subtract the number of unicorns in the complete sections from the total number of unicorns to find out how many unicorns will be in the incomplete section: 265 - 145 = &lt;&lt;265-145=120&gt;&gt;120 unicorns.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many cannonballs will be in each crate, we divide the total number of cannonballs by the number of crates: 923/499 = &lt;&lt;923/499=1.85&gt;&gt;1.85 (rounded to two decimal places). Since we can't have a fraction of a cannonball, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 cannonball per crate.

Now, we multiply the number of crates by the number of cannonballs per crate to find out how many cannonballs will be distributed: 499 * 1 = &lt;&lt;499*1=499&gt;&gt;499 cannonballs.

Finally, we subtract the number of distributed cannonballs from the total number of cannonballs to find out how many will be left uncrated: 923 - 499 = &lt;&lt;923-499=424&gt;&gt;424 cannonballs.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many cannonballs will be in each crate, we divide the total number of cannonballs by the number of crates: 462/499 = &lt;&lt;462/499=0.926&gt;&gt;0.926 (rounded to three decimal places). Since we can't have a fraction of a cannonball, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 0 cannonballs per crate.

Since we can't distribute any cannonballs into the crates, all 462 cannonballs will be left uncrated.

        On a treasure map, there are 236 steps mentioned on the guide. If every 44 steps I make leads me to a significant place or clue, how many steps will be left after I reach the last significant place or clue?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many significant places or clues there are, we divide the total number of steps by the number of steps between each significant place or clue.

236 steps / 44 steps per significant place = &lt;&lt;236/44=5.36&gt;&gt;5 significant places (since we can't have a fraction of a significant place, we round down to the nearest whole number).

Now, to find out how many steps will be left after reaching the last significant place, we multiply the number of significant places by the number of steps between each significant place and subtract that from the total number of steps.

5 significant places * 44 steps per significant place = &lt;&lt;5*44=220&gt;&gt;220 steps.

236 steps - 220 steps = &lt;&lt;236-220=16&gt;&gt;16 steps will be left after reaching the last significant place.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of kids that can be accommodated at a time is 931/34 = &lt;&lt;931/34=27.38235294117647&gt;&gt;27.38235294117647. Since we can't have a fraction of a kid, we'll round down to 27 kids per swing set.
The number of swing sets needed to accommodate all the kids is 931/27 = &lt;&lt;931/27=34.48148148148148&gt;&gt;34.48148148148148. Since we can't have a fraction of a swing set, we'll round up to 35 swing sets.
The number of kids that can be accommodated with 35 swing sets is 35*27 = &lt;&lt;35\*27=945&gt;&gt;945.
The number of kids waiting for their turn is 931-945 = &lt;&lt;931-945=-14&gt;&gt;-14. Since we can't have a negative number of kids waiting, this means that all the kids will be able to use the swings without waiting.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total rainfall of 612 inches divided by 29 days equals 612/29 = &lt;&lt;612/29=21.103448275862068&gt;&gt;21.103448275862068 inches per day.
Since the rain cannot fall in a fraction of an inch, the rainfall must be rounded to the nearest whole number.
Rounding 21.103448275862068 inches to the nearest whole number gives 21 inches per day.
Therefore, the total rainfall of 612 inches divided by 21 inches per day equals 612/21 = &lt;&lt;612/21=29&gt;&gt;29 days.
Since the rain fell for 29 consecutive days, there would be no rain left to make the days evenly rainy.

        A rope manufacturer has made a rope of 934 meters in length. This rope is supposed to be cut into smaller pieces, each piece being 902 meters in length. After cutting into the maximum possible number of equal pieces, how many meters will the last piece of the rope be?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

The remaining upgraded robots that will not fit in the storage unit are 820 - 625 = &lt;&lt;820-625=195&gt;&gt;195 robots.

        A cloud changes its shape by reducing its water droplets. Initially, there were 516 droplets in the cloud. If the cloud loses water droplets at an equal rate and becomes entirely dry after every 289 droplets, how many droplets will be left when the cloud is dry after the final cycle?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The cloud loses water droplets at an equal rate of 289 droplets per cycle.
The cloud initially had 516 droplets.
After the first cycle, the cloud will have 516 - 289 = &lt;&lt;516-289=227&gt;&gt;227 droplets left.
After the second cycle, the cloud will have 227 - 289 = &lt;&lt;227-289=-62&gt;&gt;0 droplets left (since the cloud cannot have a negative number of droplets).
Therefore, the cloud will be entirely dry after the second cycle, and there will be 0 droplets left.

The number of boxes that can be loaded into 82 trucks is 82*4 = &lt;&lt;82*4=328&gt;&gt;328.

        On a pirate ship, there are 995 gold coins that need to be evenly divided among the 267 pirates. If they split the gold up as evenly as possible, how many gold coins will be left over?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many gold coins each pirate will get, we divide the total number of gold coins by the number of pirates: 995/267 = &lt;&lt;995/267=3.726591759550562&gt;&gt;3.726591759550562. Since we can't have a fraction of a gold coin, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3.

To find out how many gold coins will be left over, we multiply the number of pirates by the number of gold coins each pirate gets and subtract that from the total number of gold coins: 267*3 = &lt;&lt;267\*3=801&gt;&gt;801.

995 - 801 = &lt;&lt;995-801=194&gt;&gt;194 gold coins will be left over.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: After the first wave of children, there are 923 children waiting again.
881 children can go down the slide without any break this time.
The number of children left waiting for their turn is 923 - 881 = &lt;&lt;923-881=42&gt;&gt;42.

        Superhero Iron Punch has to save 442 people from a collapsing building. He can teleport a maximum of 104 people at a time to safety. After teleporting as many full groups as he can, how many people will be left in the building for his last round of rescue?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Iron Punch can teleport 442/104 = &lt;&lt;442/104=4&gt;&gt;4 full groups of people to safety.
4 * 104 = &lt;&lt;4*104=416&gt;&gt;416 people will be teleported in the full groups.
442 - 416 = &lt;&lt;442-416=26&gt;&gt;26 people will be left in the building for the last round of rescue.

        What if there were actually 512 people in the collapsing building instead of 442? After Superhero Iron Punch teleports as many full groups of 104 people as he can to safety, how many people will be left in the building for his last round of rescue now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Iron Punch can teleport 512/104 = &lt;&lt;512/104=5&gt;&gt;5 full groups of people to safety.
5 * 104 = &lt;&lt;5*104=520&gt;&gt;520 people will be teleported in the full groups.
512 - 520 = &lt;&lt;512-520=-8&gt;&gt;512 - 520 is not possible, as there cannot be a negative number of people left in the building.
Therefore, Iron Punch can teleport all 512 people to safety in 5 full groups.
