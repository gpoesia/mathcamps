            Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?

            King Arthur is calculating the costs for restoring his castle. The wall repairs cost 26/22 of his castle's annual budget. Meanwhile, the moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget. Finally, installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget. How much (expressed as a fraction of the castle's annual budget) has King Arthur spent on these projects in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

Wall repairs cost: 26/22 of the budget
Moat renovations cost: 4/29 of the budget
Defensive catapults cost: 11/3 of the budget

Total cost = (26/22) + (4/29) + (11/3)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 22, 29, and 3 is 1887.

So, we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 1887:

Wall repairs cost: (26/22) = (26 * 86) / (22 * 86) = 2236 / 1887
Moat renovations cost: (4/29) = (4 * 65) / (29 * 65) = 260 / 1887
Defensive catapults cost: (11/3) = (11 * 629) / (3 * 629) = 6919 / 1887

Total cost = (2236/1887) + (260/1887) + (6919/1887)

Total cost = (2236 + 260 + 6919) / 1887

Total cost = 9415 / 1887

So, King Arthur has spent 9415/1887 of his castle's annual budget on these projects in total.

            A giraffe at the local zoo has a peculiar eating habit. When it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves, it eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day. If the zoo calculates the weekly feeding amount by multiplying the daily intake by itself (making the result &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;) and then multiplying that with the regular daily intake, how many pounds of acacia leaves should they prepare for the giraffe for a week? Calculate ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26))^2 * ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26)) and provide your answer.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: You have 28/29 of the first set of chocolate bars and 8/22 of the second set of chocolate bars.
To find the total fraction of chocolate bars you have, you need to add the two fractions together.
First, find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 29 and 22 is 638.
Convert the first fraction to have a denominator of 638: 28/29 = (28\*22)/(29\*22) = 616/638
Convert the second fraction to have a denominator of 638: 8/22 = (8\*29)/(22\*29) = 232/638
Add the two fractions together: 616/638 + 232/638 = (616+232)/638 = 848/638
Simplify the fraction: 848/638 = 424/319

            A compass maker is creating some specialty compasses. 

The compass needle is made from a special material. It takes 27/26 of a pound to create one needle. 

If the maker is trying to produce two identical needles, how much material will he require? 

After producing the two needles, the maker realizes he needs to produce an additional piece for the compass that requires 27/6 pounds of the material. 

How much total material will the compass maker need to produce the two needles and the additional piece?

The additional piece requires 27/6 = &lt;&lt;27/6=9/2&gt;&gt;9/2 pounds of material.

            Imagine you're a music producer who is working on a new song. Your resources are divided into different sections.

- First, you dedicate 16/4 hours to composing the music and another 16/29 hours to writing the lyrics. This is your initial time investment for the song (let's call it p).

- Then, you spend 28/13 hours for mixing and mastering the song in addition to the initial time investment (let's call this new total time b).

- Suddenly, a drummer you hired for a session uses 18/4 hours less because he finished his parts quickly.

What is the final time you spent on producing the song, if your total time is expressed as (b - (18 / 4))?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

First, let's find the initial time investment (p) for composing the music and writing the lyrics:

p = 16/4 + 16/29
p = 4 + 16/29
p = 4 + 0.5517 (rounded to 4 decimal places)
p = 4.5517 hours

Next, let's find the total time (b) spent on mixing, mastering, and the initial time investment:

b = p + 28/13
b = 4.5517 + 28/13
b = 4.5517 + 2.1538 (rounded to 4 decimal places)
b = 6.7055 hours

Now, let's find the time saved by the drummer:

18/4 = 4.5 hours

Finally, let's find the final time spent on producing the song:

Final time = b - (18 / 4)
Final time = 6.7055 - 4.5
Final time = 2.2055 hours

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Princess Lily ate 10/12 of the apple pie and 10/29 of the blueberry pie.
To find out how much of the pies she ate combined, we need to add the fractions:
10/12 + 10/29 = (290 + 120) / (12 * 29) = 410 / 348
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
410 / 348 = (410/2) / (348/2) = 205 / 174

            A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspectâ€™s involvement. Calculate the value of f.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

For the first pair of evidence specimens, the ratio of changes (indicator i) is calculated as follows:

i = (26/6) / (25/17)

To simplify this, we can cross-multiply:

i = (26 * 17) / (6 * 25)

i = 442 / 150

i = 2.946666667

For the second pair of evidence specimens, the difference between the two rates (indicator h) is calculated as follows:

h = (18/8) - (17/23)

To simplify this, we can find a common denominator and subtract the fractions:

h = (18 * 23) / (8 * 23) - (17 * 8) / (23 * 8)

h = (414 - 136) / (184)

h = 278 / 184

h = 1.510869565

Now, to find the final evidence factor (indicator f), we multiply indicators h and i:

f = h * i

f = 1.510869565 * 2.946666667

f = 4.454545455

Therefore, the value of the final evidence factor (indicator f) is approximately 4.45.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The gestation period of a lioness is 20/22 of a year, which is approximately 0.9091 years.
The gestation period of a giraffe is 15 years.
The total gestation period of both animals together is 0.9091 + 15 = &lt;&lt;0.9091+15=15.9091&gt;&gt;15.9091 years.
Later in the same year, the lioness is pregnant again and her gestation period reduces by 15/20 of a year compared to the earlier total gestation period of both animals.
The reduction in the gestation period is 15/20 \* 15.9091 = &lt;&lt;15/20\*15.9091=11.931825&gt;&gt;11.931825 years.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The factory initially produces 23/8 tonnes of soap each day. They increase production by an extra 4/20 tonnes, which is equivalent to 1/5 tonnes. So, the new production is 23/8 + 1/5 = &lt;&lt;(23/8) + (1/5)=(115/40 + 8/40)=123/40&gt;&gt;123/40 tonnes.

However, later that same day, they reduce the production by 19/24 tonnes due to a sudden power cut. This reduction is equivalent to 19/24 = &lt;&lt;19/24=0.7916666666666666&gt;&gt;0.7916666666666666 tonnes.

So, the final production for that day is 123/40 - 19/24 = &lt;&lt;(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19/24)=(123/40) - (19</pre>

            You have a paint mixing machine that creates specific shades of color.

The machine starts by mixing 24/8 gallons of red paint. It then pours away 12/8 gallons of the mix. Let 'd' represent the amount of red paint left in the machine.

Finally, the machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color, subtract that from 'd' to find 'x' in gallons, which is the total amount of paint. Find the value of 'x'.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The machine starts with 24/8 = &lt;&lt;24/8=3&gt;&gt;3 gallons of red paint.
The machine pours away 12/8 = &lt;&lt;12/8=1.5&gt;&gt;1.5 gallons of the mix.
So, the amount of red paint left in the machine is 3 - 1.5 = &lt;&lt;3-1.5=1.5&gt;&gt;1.5 gallons.
The machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color.
So, the total amount of paint in the machine is 1.5 - 1/28 = &lt;&lt;1.5-(1/28)=1.5-(0.03571428571428571)=1.4642857142857142&gt;&gt;1.4642857142857142 gallons.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the new amount of mashed bananas needed, we need to multiply the original fraction (459 / 182) by the scaling factor (8 / 4).

First, let's simplify the scaling factor:

(8 / 4) = 2

Now, we multiply the original fraction by the scaling factor:

(459 / 182) * 2 = (459 * 2) / 182

Now, we calculate the product:

459 * 2 = &lt;&lt;459*2=918&gt;&gt;918

So, the new amount of mashed bananas needed is 918 / 182.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 918 and 182 is 2. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

918 / 2 = &lt;&lt;918/2=459&gt;&gt;459
182 / 2 = &lt;&lt;182/2=91&gt;&gt;91

Now, suppose their mom includes an amount of toothpaste for herself to the total - she uses 3/18 oz of toothpaste daily.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

First, let's find the total daily amount of toothpaste used by Sonia and Anthony.

Sonia uses 21/12 oz of toothpaste daily.
Anthony uses 6/27 oz of toothpaste daily.

To add these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 12 and 27 is 108.

Sonia's toothpaste usage in ounces per day with a common denominator is (21/12) * (108/108) = 189/108 oz.
Anthony's toothpaste usage in ounces per day with a common denominator is (6/27) * (108/108) = 24/108 oz.

Now, we can add these two fractions:

Total toothpaste usage by Sonia and Anthony = 189/108 + 24/108 = 213/108 oz.

Next, let's find the total daily amount of toothpaste used by the whole family, including their mom.

Their mom uses 3/18 oz of toothpaste daily.

To add this amount to the total used by Sonia and Anthony, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 108 and 18 is 108.

Their mom's toothpaste usage in ounces per day with a common denominator is (3/18) * (108/108) = 18/108 oz.

Now, we can add this fraction to the total used by Sonia and Anthony:

Total toothpaste usage by the whole family = 213/108 + 18/108 = 231/108 oz.

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9:

Total toothpaste usage by the whole family = (231/9) / (108/9) = 25.666... / 12 oz.

Since we want a simplified fraction, we can round this to the nearest whole number and express it as a fraction:

Total toothpaste usage by the whole family â‰ˆ 26/12 oz.

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

Total toothpaste usage by the whole family â‰ˆ (26/2) / (12/2) = 13/6 oz.

            Let's suppose for a special recipe sandwich, you need to divide a wheel of cheese into 14 equal parts and a pickle jar into 18 equal parts. 

To make one special sandwich, you need 21 parts of the wheel of cheese and 7 parts from the pickle jar.

You've just made these sandwiches and you are down to ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of your original ingredients.

Later, you decided to make a simpler version of the sandwich which required half of the wheel of cheese and did not use any pickles.

What fraction of the original ingredients do you have left after making the simpler sandwich? Calculate the answer by subtracting (2 / 4) from the fraction you had after making the first sandwich.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: After making the first sandwich, you have (7/18 + 21/14) of the original ingredients.

To simplify 21/14, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 7, which gives us 3/2.

So, the fraction of the original ingredients left after making the first sandwich is (7/18 + 3/2).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 2 is 18, so we convert 3/2 to 27/18.

Now, the fraction of the original ingredients left after making the first sandwich is (7/18 + 27/18) = 34/18.

To simplify 34/18, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2, which gives us 17/9.

After making the simpler sandwich, you use half of the wheel of cheese, which is (1/2) of the original ingredients.

To subtract (1/2) from 17/9, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 9 is 18, so we convert 1/2 to 9/18.

Now, the fraction of the original ingredients left after making the simpler sandwich is (17/9 - 9/18).

To subtract these fractions, we can convert 17/9 to 34/18 and then subtract 9/18 from 34/18, which gives us 25/18.

To simplify 25/18, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5, which gives us 5/3.

            Sophia is a researcher who studies sunglasses. She was examining a batch of sunglasses and trying to calculate the average light blocking efficiency.

In the first test, she found that 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays completely, while in the second test, 20 out of every 18 sunglasses also blocked all UV rays.

Sophia decided to add these numbers to her total. Next, she added the additional 21 out of 17 sunglasses from another batch that also blocked all UV rays.

Later, she realized she made a mistake and needed to subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that actually did not block all UV rays.

What is the final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays, according to Sophia's tests and calculations? Please give your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

First test: 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays completely.
This can be simplified to 13/4 = &lt;&lt;13/4=3.25&gt;&gt;3.25 sunglasses per sunglass.

Second test: 20 out of every 18 sunglasses also blocked all UV rays.
This can be simplified to 20/18 = &lt;&lt;20/18=1.1111111111111112&gt;&gt;1.1111111111111112 sunglasses per sunglass.

Additional batch: 21 out of 17 sunglasses blocked all UV rays.
This can be simplified to 21/17 = &lt;&lt;21/17=1.2352941176470588&gt;&gt;1.2352941176470588 sunglasses per sunglass.

Subtracting the sunglasses that did not block all UV rays: 16 out of 30 sunglasses.
This can be simplified to 16/30 = &lt;&lt;16/30=0.5333333333333333&gt;&gt;0.5333333333333333 sunglasses per sunglass.

Adding the first test, second test, and additional batch:
3.25 + 1.1111111111111112 + 1.2352941176470588 = &lt;&lt;3.25+1.1111111111111112+1.2352941176470588=5.59640523875827&gt;&gt;5.59640523875827 sunglasses per sunglass.

Subtracting the sunglasses that did not block all UV rays:
5.59640523875827 - 0.5333333333333333 = &lt;&lt;5.59640523875827-0.5333333333333333=5.0630719054249365&gt;&gt;5.0630719054249365 sunglasses per sunglass.

This can be simplified to 5.0630719054249365/1 = &lt;&lt;5.0630719054249365/1=5.0630719054249365&gt;&gt;5.0630719054249365 sunglasses per sunglass.

Since the final answer should be a simplified fraction, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 5 sunglasses per sunglass.

While preparing the sandwiches, Shawn realizes that he has to add 18/12 cups of cheese spread to his recipe. Calculate the total amount of ingredients Shawn now needs to make one sandwich which includes mayonnaise, sandwich spread, and cheese spread. 

Finally, if Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, how many cups of ingredients will he use in total to make those sandwiches?

Shawn has to add 18/12 = &lt;&lt;18/12=1.5&gt;&gt;1.5 cups of cheese spread to his recipe.

So, Shawn now needs 1.0416666666666667 + 1.5 = &lt;&lt;1.0416666666666667+1.5=2.5416666666666665&gt;&gt;2.5416666666666665 cups of ingredients to make one sandwich.

If Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, he will use 4/4 \* 2.5416666666666665 = &lt;&lt;4/4\*2.5416666666666665=2.5416666666666665&gt;&gt;2.5416666666666665 cups of ingredients per sandwich.

If Shawn makes 4 sandwiches, he will use 2.5416666666666665 \* 4 = &lt;&lt;2.5416666666666665\*4=10.166666666666666&gt;&gt;10.166666666666666 cups of ingredients.

If Shawn makes 6 sandwiches, he will use 2.5416666666666665 \* 6 = &lt;&lt;2.5416666666666665\*6=15.25&gt;&gt;15.25 cups of ingredients.

(22/25) \* (22/8) = (22\*22)/(25\*8) = 484/200 = &lt;&lt;484/200=2.42&gt;&gt;2.42

However, this is not a whole number, and the puzzle requires a whole number answer. Therefore, we need to simplify the fraction.

484/200 = 121/50 = &lt;&lt;121/50=2.42&gt;&gt;2.42

This fraction cannot be simplified further, so the puzzle must have a mistake or require a different approach.

            You solved the first part of the puzzle with the result from multiplying the fractions 22/25 and 22/8. Now, you've come across a key with the number 23/13 etched on it. To open the next door, you need to add the result from the step you just completed to the number on the key. What is the sum of these two values?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The result from the previous step was 121/50 or 2.42.

The number on the key is 23/13.

To add these two values, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 50 and 13 is 650.

So, we convert 121/50 to 1533/650 and 23/13 to 115/650.

Now, we can add the two fractions:

1533/650 + 115/650 = 1648/650 = &lt;&lt;1648/650=2.5354285714285715&gt;&gt;2.5354285714285715

However, this is not a whole number, and the puzzle requires a whole number answer. Therefore, we need to simplify the fraction.

1648/650 = 3296/1300 = &lt;&lt;3296/1300=2.5353846153846154&gt;&gt;2.5353846153846154

This fraction cannot be simplified further, so the puzzle must have a mistake or require a different approach.

### Answer: The sum of the result from the previous step and the number on the key is 3296/1300 or 2.5353846153846154, but this is not a whole number.</pre>

            Previously, you multiplied fractions 22/25 and 22/8 in the first part of the puzzle. Suppose instead of the 22/25 that you initially saw, the actual fraction in the text was 13/25.

(13/25) \* (22/8) = (13\*22)/(25\*8) = 286/200 = &lt;&lt;286/200=1.43&gt;&gt;1.43

However, this is not a whole number, and the puzzle requires a whole number answer. Therefore, we need to simplify the fraction.

First, let's find the total quantity of honey from a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, which is represented by 'p'.

p = (25 / 9) + (25 / 9)

p = 50 / 9
p = &lt;&lt;50/9=5.555555555555555&gt;&gt;5.555555555555555 gallons

Now, let's find the total quantity of honey from a honey storage sub-section with an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey and a bee rearing sub-section, which is represented by 's'.

s = (25 / 9) + (2 / 26) + (25 / 9)
s = (2 * 25) / 9 + (2 / 26)
s = 50 / 9 + (2 / 26)

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions (7/8) and (21/18). The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72.

So, we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

(7/8) = (63/72)
(21/18) = (28/72)

Now, we can add the fractions:

(63/72) + (28/72) = (91/72)

The fraction (91/72) is already in simplest form, as 91 and 72 have no common factors other than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, let's simplify the fractions:

* 15/7 gallons of water per guest = 15/7 = &lt;&lt;15/7=2.142857142857143&gt;&gt;2.142857142857143 gallons
* 15/24 gallons of wine per guest = 15/24 = &lt;&lt;15/24=0.625&gt;&gt;0.625 gallons
* 26/20 gallons of milk per cake = 26/20 = &lt;&lt;26/20=1.3&gt;&gt;1.3 gallons

Now, let's calculate the total amount of liquid consumed by the guests:

* Water: 2.142857142857143 gallons per guest
* Wine: 0.625 gallons per guest
* Total per guest: 2.142857142857143 + 0.625 = &lt;&lt;2.142857142857143+0.625=2.767857142857143&gt;&gt;2.767857142857143 gallons

Next, let's calculate the baker's requirement for milk:

* Milk: 1.3 gallons per cake

Now, let's calculate the total amount of liquid needed for the feast:

* Guests' consumption: 2.767857142857143 gallons per guest
* Baker's requirement: 1.3 gallons per cake
* Total: 2.767857142857143 + 1.3 = &lt;&lt;2.767857142857143+1.3=4.067857142857143&gt;&gt;4.067857142857143 gallons per guest

Therefore, the total amount of liquid needed for the feast is 4.067857142857143 gallons per guest.

            Carlos realized he could be using a more efficient design for his chairs. Instead of using 20/15 units of wood as he was previously, he can now use only 20/8 units for the basic chair design. The larger design with the special feature still requires (24/5) times (7/6) units more wood than the basic chair.

With this more efficient design for the basic chair, how many units of wood would Carlos now need in total to make one of these larger special design chairs? Please express your answer as a simplified fraction.

            Jake is trying to figure out how many grapes he can get from a certain vineyard. 

- The vineyard can usually produce 19/2 baskets of grapes every season. However, due to weather conditions, only 19/29 of the usual amount were produced this season. How many baskets of grapes were produced this season?

- But Jake isn't the only one interested in these grapes. He has to share the grapes with others. He gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes. How many baskets of grapes does he get?

- Out of the grapes that he got, Jake wants to make some grape juice. But he only uses 9/10 of his grapes to make the juice. How many baskets of grapes does he use for the juice?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

1. The vineyard can usually produce 19/2 = &lt;&lt;19/2=9.5&gt;&gt;9.5 baskets of grapes every season. However, due to weather conditions, only 19/29 of the usual amount were produced this season. So, the number of baskets produced this season is 19/2 \* 19/29 = &lt;&lt;(19/2)*(19/29)=3.5&gt;&gt;3.5 baskets.
2. Jake gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes. So, the number of baskets he gets is 3.5 \* 7/11 = &lt;&lt;3.5*(7/11)=2.142857142857143&gt;&gt;2.14 baskets.
3. Out of the grapes that he got, Jake wants to make some grape juice. But he only uses 9/10 of his grapes to make the juice. So, the number of baskets he uses for the juice is 2.14 \* 9/10 = &lt;&lt;2.14*(9/10)=1.926&gt;&gt;1.93 baskets.

            In a beautiful forest, the park rangers recorded that 9 out of every 14 trees were pine trees. They also noticed an exceptional occurrence where 19 out of every 2 trees were birches. If you count all the pine trees and birch trees together, what fraction of the trees in the forest are either pine or birch? Use the formula f = ((9 / 14) + (19 / 2)) to solve this.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The formula provided is incorrect. The correct formula to find the fraction of pine and birch trees in the forest is f = (9/14) + (19/28).

First, we need to find the fraction of birch trees in the forest. Since 19 out of every 28 trees are birches, the fraction of birch trees is 19/28.

Next, we add the fraction of pine trees (9/14) to the fraction of birch trees (19/28) to find the total fraction of pine and birch trees in the forest.

f = (9/14) + (19/28)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 14 and 28 is 28.

So, we convert 9/14 to 18/28 and add it to 19/28.

f = (18/28) + (19/28)

f = 37/28

Therefore, the fraction of trees in the forest that are either pine or birch is 37/28.

            During rainy weather, a small snail moves at a snail-pace covering 17/21 of a meter in an hour. Another slightly faster snail covers 20/24 of a meter in the same time during such weather. 

One rainy day, the first snail started an hour earlier than the second. At the time when the second snail began, a third snail that covers 18/17 of a meter per hour also started moving. 

What is their total distance in meters 1 hour after all three have started moving? Compute the result using the operation ((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) for the first two snails' distance, and multiply this result by (18 / 17) for the total distance , including the third snail.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:
First, let's find the total distance covered by the first two snails in one hour.

The first snail covers 17/21 of a meter in an hour, and the second snail covers 20/24 of a meter in an hour.

To find the total distance covered by both snails in one hour, we add their distances:

(17/21) + (20/24) = (17 \* 24 + 20 \* 21) / (21 \* 24) = (408 + 420) / 504 = 828 / 504 = 1.643253968254 (approximately)

Now, let's find the distance covered by the third snail in one hour.

The third snail covers 18/17 of a meter in an hour.

To find the total distance covered by all three snails in one hour, we multiply the total distance covered by the first two snails by the distance covered by the third snail:

1.643253968254 \* (18/17) = 1.643253968254 \* 1.058823529412 = 1.739999999999 (approximately)

Therefore, the total distance covered by all three snails in one hour is approximately 1.74 meters.

The difference between the original and remaining fabric is 1.7142857142857142 - 0.3103448275862069 = &lt;&lt;1.7142857142857142-0.3103448275862069=1.4039408866995073&gt;&gt;1.4039408866995073 yards.

            In a park, there are some kids lining up for the swings. Part of the waiting line consists of 2/10 of the total number of kids in the park, while another part is made up of 21/4 kids. What is the total number of kids waiting for the swing? Add together 2/10 and 21/4 to find your answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total number of kids waiting for the swing, we need to add the two parts of the waiting line together.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 2/10 and 21/4. The least common multiple of 10 and 4 is 20, so we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 20.

2/10 = (2\*2)/(10\*2) = 4/20
21/4 = (21\*5)/(4\*5) = 105/20

Now we can add the two fractions together:

4/20 + 105/20 = (4+105)/20 = 109/20

So, the total number of kids waiting for the swing is 109/20 of the total number of kids in the park.

To find the total number of kids in the park, we can set up the equation:

2/10 + 21/4 = 109/20

Multiplying both sides by 20 to eliminate the denominator, we get:

4 + 105 = 109

Since we are looking for the total number of kids in the park, we can ignore the left side of the equation and focus on the right side.

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 109.

Since the waiting line consists of 109/20 of the total number of kids in the park, we can find the number of kids waiting for the swing by multiplying the total number of kids by 109/20:

109 \* (109/20) = 11881/20 = 594.05

Since we can't have a fraction of a kid, we can round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the total number of kids waiting for the swing is 595.

After grouping everything, you realized you can only fit 26/27 of them in your display case. How many sets of toothbrushes can you fit in your display case?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's assume the total number of sets of toothbrushes you have is x.

You add 7/15 of a new set to your current collection, so you have x + 7/15 sets.

Your friend gifts you 9 more sets, so you have x + 7/15 + 9 sets.

You can only fit 26/27 of your total sets in your display case, so you have (26/27) \* (x + 7/15 + 9) sets.

Since you want to know how many sets you can fit in your display case, we need to find the value of x that makes the equation true.

Let's set up the equation:

(26/27) \* (x + 7/15 + 9) = 26/27 \* x

Now, we can solve for x:

x + 7/15 + 9 = x

7/15 + 9 = 0

This equation doesn't make sense, so we need to re-evaluate our approach.

Let's try a different approach:

We know that you can only fit 26/27 of your total sets in your display case. So, we can set up the equation:

(26/27) \* (x + 7/15 + 9) = y

where y is the number of sets you can fit in your display case.

Now, we can solve for y:

y = (26/27) \* (x + 7/15 + 9)

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't solve for y directly. However, we can simplify the equation:

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 9)

Now, we can plug in the values for 7/15 and 9:

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 243/27)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 9)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 243/27)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 9)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 243/27)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 9)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 243/27)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 9)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 243/27)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 9)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 243/27)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 9)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 243/27)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 9)

y = (26/27) \* x + (26/27) \* (7/15 + 243/27)

            Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements. 

What does Captain Alfâ€™s final calculation come to? Use these steps and corresponding fractions to find your answer.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

1. Difference in location and distance to the island:
   Distance to the island = 17/2 nautical miles
   Current location = 4/2 nautical miles away from the island
   Difference = 17/2 - 4/2 = &lt;&lt;17/2 - 4/2 = 13/2&gt;&gt;13/2 nautical miles

2. Adjusting for the tide:
   Tide adjustment = 14/9 nautical miles
   Adjusted distance = 13/2 + 14/9 = &lt;&lt;13/2 + 14/9 = 117/18 + 28/18 = 145/18&gt;&gt;145/18 nautical miles

3. Calculating fuel requirements:
   Fuel efficiency = 22/15 nautical miles per gallon

            Let's modify the earlier scenario from Lucas's shirt store. This time, Lucas initially divided 18 shirts equally among his 3 siblings as before. However, later he purchased 29 shirts instead of 27. If he still wants to distribute 1/19 of these new shirts to each sibling, how many more or fewer shirts will each sibling now have compared to before? Calculate the difference using the expression ((18 / 3) - (29 / 19)) and find out the result.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Initially, Lucas had 18 shirts and divided them equally among his 3 siblings, so each sibling got 18/3 = &lt;&lt;18/3=6&gt;&gt;6 shirts.
Later, Lucas bought 29 more shirts and decided to keep only 1/19 of those shirts for each sibling, so each sibling got 29/19 = &lt;&lt;29/19=1.5263157894736843&gt;&gt;1.5263157894736843 shirts.
The difference in the number of shirts each sibling has now as compared to before is (18/3) - (29/19) = &lt;&lt;(18/3)-(29/19)=4.4736842105263155&gt;&gt;4.4736842105263155 shirts.
Since the result is positive, each sibling has more shirts now than before.
### Answer: Each sibling has 4.4736842105263155 more shirts now than before.</pre>

            Callie owns a pen business. Last month, she sold 20 pens for every 15 she produced. At the same time, she sold an additional 16 pens for every 22 she put out for sale. 

Meanwhile, she found that for every 22 pens she advertised, 27 were interested customers. For each 23 pens she produced this week, she was able to sell 8. 

What is the result when she multiplies the ratio of last month's sales to production (20/15 + 16/22) and this week's figure for the ratio of interested customers to production (22/27 * 23/8)? Leave your answer as an unsimplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

Last month's sales to production ratio is (20/15 + 16/22).

This week's ratio of interested customers to production is (22/27 * 23/8).

To find the result when Callie multiplies these two ratios, we can write the expression as:

(20/15 + 16/22) * (22/27 * 23/8)

First, let's simplify the first ratio:

(20/15 + 16/22) = (4/3 + 8/11) = (44/33 + 24/33) = 68/33

Now, let's simplify the second ratio:

(22/27 * 23/8) = (22 * 23) / (27 * 8) = 506 / 216

Finally, let's multiply the two ratios:

(68/33) * (506/216) = (68 * 506) / (33 * 216) = 34368 / 7128

So, the result when Callie multiplies the two ratios is 34368/7128.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The musician spent 30 minutes / 15 songs = &lt;&lt;30/15=2&gt;&gt;2 minutes on each song.

Later that afternoon, his friend Jack also rented a scooter and rode it for 7/17 of an hour. 

How many hours did they both ride scooters in total (expressed as a fraction)? Combine the hours they both rode and simplify the fraction to get the answer.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Josh rode the scooter for 18 + 1/12 = &lt;&lt;18+(1/12)=(18*12+1)/12=217/12&gt;&gt;217/12 hours in total.

Together, they rode the scooter for 217/12 + 7/17 = &lt;&lt;(217/12)+(7/17)=(217*17+7*12)/(12*17)=3659/204&gt;&gt;3659/204 hours in total.
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 17.

            A lamp store owner is doing inventory of all the lamps in his store. He found that he has 4/26 of lamps that are floor lamps, 15/11 that are desk lamps, he also discovered he has 23/28 of table lamps and finally 8/19 of lamps that are decorative. What fraction of his total inventory do these lamps constitute?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the fraction of the total inventory that these lamps constitute, we need to add the fractions of each type of lamp together.

First, we need to find a common denominator for all the fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 26, 11, 28, and 19 is 26*11*28*19 = 149484.

Now, we can convert each fraction to have the same denominator:

* Floor lamps: (4/26) \* (11*28*19/11*28*19) = 4 \* 11 \* 28 \* 19 / 149484 = 21296 / 149484
* Desk lamps: (15/11) \* (26*28*19/26*28*19) = 15 \* 26 \* 28 \* 19 / 149484 = 114240 / 149484
* Table lamps: (23/28) \* (26*11*19/26*11*19) = 23 \* 26 \* 11 \* 19 / 149484 = 124509 / 149484
* Decorative lamps: (8/19) \* (26*11*28/26*11*28) = 8 \* 26 \* 11 \* 28 / 149484 = 61600 / 149484

Now, we can add these fractions together:

21296/149484 + 114240/149484 + 124509/149484 + 61600/149484 = 321645 / 149484

Therefore, the fraction of the total inventory that these lamps constitute is 321645 / 149484.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In a snow fight, Mike threw 9/19 of his snowballs and his friend, John threw 6/8 of his snowballs. After a while, Mike found 4 more snowballs to throw.

The question is, if 'u' represents the number of snowballs thrown by both Mike and John and 'j' is the total number of snowballs Mike had after finding more, how many snowballs did Mike have in total?

Solve the following equations to find the variable 'j':

u = 9/19 + 6/8

j = u + 4/1

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning:

First, let's find the value of 'u' by adding the fractions of snowballs thrown by Mike and John:

u = 9/19 + 6/8

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 19 and 8 is 152. So we convert the fractions to have the same denominator:

u = (9 * 8) / (19 * 8) + (6 * 19) / (8 * 19)

u = 72/152 + 114/152

Now we can add the numerators:

u = (72 + 114) / 152

u = 186/152

Now we simplify the fraction:

u = 93/76

Now that we have the value of 'u', we can find the value of 'j':

j = u + 4/1

j = 93/76 + 4/1

To add these, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 76 and 1 is 76. So we convert the second fraction to have the same denominator:

j = 93/76 + (4 * 76) / (1 * 76)

j = 93/76 + 304/76

Now we can add the numerators:

j = (93 + 304) / 76

j = 397/76

Now we simplify the fraction:

j = 5.2236842105263155

Since the number of snowballs must be a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number:

j â‰ˆ 5

Therefore, Mike had approximately 5 snowballs in total.

The first recipe requires (27 / 3) cups flour and (11 / 7) cups sugar. She determines the ratio of flour to sugar by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar. She then subtracts (21 / 26) from this ratio because that's how many cups of sugar her friend says makes the cookies too sweet. After that, she adds (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio to see how many total cups of flour she will need. How many cups of flour will she have in the end?

However, since the total fraction cannot exceed 1 (which represents a full tank), we need to find the equivalent fraction that represents the total amount of fuel added to the tank.

Since this fraction is greater than 1, it means that the UFO was able to fill more than its full tank during the two stops. However, since the tank cannot hold more than its capacity, the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill is 1.

            Professor Astro is working on his telescope. He believes the power of his telescope is directly proportional to the sum of two fractions. The first fraction is the light gathering power of the lens, which is 24 out of 27. The second fraction is the zooming potential, which is 30 out of 26. So, Professor Astro calculates the sum of these two fractions ((24 / 27) + (30 / 26)). What does he find?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of the two fractions, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 27 and 26 is 702.

So, we convert the first fraction to have a denominator of 702:
(24 / 27) = (24 * 26) / (27 * 26) = 624 / 702

And we convert the second fraction to have a denominator of 702:
(30 / 26) = (30 * 27) / (26 * 27) = 810 / 702

Now we can add the two fractions:
(624 / 702) + (810 / 702) = (624 + 810) / 702 = 1434 / 702

Professor Astro finds that the sum of the two fractions is 1434 / 702.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Upon recalculating his telescope's potential with more accurate data, Professor Astro realizes that the light gathering power of his lens is actually 12 out of 27, not 24 out of 27 as previously calculated. Professor Astro recalculates the sum of these two fractions ((12 / 27) + (30 / 26)). What is the resulting sum now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the sum of the two fractions, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 27 and 26 is 702.

So, we convert the first fraction to have a denominator of 702:
(12 / 27) = (12 * 26) / (27 * 26) = 312 / 702

And we convert the second fraction to have a denominator of 702:
(30 / 26) = (30 * 27) / (26 * 27) = 810 / 702

Now we can add the two fractions:
(312 / 702) + (810 / 702) = (312 + 810) / 702 = 1122 / 702

Professor Astro finds that the sum of the two fractions is 1122 / 702.
