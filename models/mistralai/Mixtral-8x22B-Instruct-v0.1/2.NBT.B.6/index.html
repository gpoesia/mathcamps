        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Initially, there were 66 teenagers + 6 adults = &lt;&lt;66+6=72&gt;&gt;72 people at the party.
The number of guests increased by 62, so there were 72 + 62 = &lt;&lt;72+62=134&gt;&gt;134 people at the party.
An additional group of 52 people joined the party, so there were 134 + 52 = &lt;&lt;134+52=186&gt;&gt;186 people at the party in total.

            In a math class, students have to draw shapes based on certain numeric conditions. One student starts by rotating an angle to form 92 degrees. Then, he rotates the same angle by an additional 84 degrees. This gives him shape 't'. He modifies shape 't' by rotating another 90 degrees and labels this as shape 'l'. Finally, he rotates it by another 66 degrees to form shape 'n'. What is the total degree measure of the rotations made to get shape 'n'?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The student rotates the angle by 92 degrees initially.
He then rotates it by an additional 84 degrees to get shape 't'.
The total rotation for shape 't' is 92 + 84 = &lt;&lt;92+84=176&gt;&gt;176 degrees.
He then rotates shape 't' by another 90 degrees to get shape 'l'.
The total rotation for shape 'l' is 176 + 90 = &lt;&lt;176+90=266&gt;&gt;266 degrees.
Finally, he rotates shape 'l' by another 66 degrees to get shape 'n'.

            Let's change the scenario a bit. Suppose the student does everything as before, rotating an angle to form 92 degrees, and again by an additional of 84 degrees to form shape 't'. Then they modify shape 't' by adding another 90 degrees to form shape 'l'. But this time, instead of rotating an additional 66 degrees for shape 'n', he rotates by 30 degrees. What would be the total degree measure of the rotations made to get to shape 'n' in this case?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The store sells 9 boxes of oranges each day, so on the first day, they have 9 boxes.
On the second day, the seller added 22 more boxes to the total from the previous day, so they have 9+22 = &lt;&lt;9+22=31&gt;&gt;31 boxes.
On the third day, the seller added another 26 boxes to that day's total, so they have 31+26 = &lt;&lt;31+26=57&gt;&gt;57 boxes.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The initial waist measurement was 194 cm.
The designer adds 9 cm to the waist measurement, so the new adjusted waist measurement is 194 cm + 9 cm = &lt;&lt;194+9=203&gt;&gt;203 cm.

            Recall the clothing designer from before. This time, the designer is creating a shirt with a different length of 99 cm. In this design, the chest measurement is defined as the length added by 11 cm. The waist measurement is set as the sum of the two chest measurements. What is the waist measurement of this new shirt design in cm?

The waist measurement is twice the chest measurement, so it is 110 cm \* 2 = &lt;&lt;110\*2=220&gt;&gt;220 cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's denote the number of sandwiches Kevin made as K.
According to the problem, the total number of sandwiches made by Sarah and Kevin is 80 + K.
We are told that this total is 33 more than the number of sandwiches made by Sarah alone, so we can write the equation:
80 + K = 80 + 33
Solving for K, we get:
K = 33
Therefore, Kevin made 33 sandwiches.

            In a painting competition, one artist uses 43 blue strokes and 53 red strokes to complete his painting. Another artist, inspired by the first one, decides to use 67 more strokes in addition to what the first artist used. A third artist doubles the total number of strokes used by the second artist for her painting. How many strokes did the third artist use in her painting?

            Looking at the painting in the gallery, the artist realizes that the painting is not quite balanced. She thinks back to the painting competition, and remembers that if she had originally used 81 blue strokes instead of 53, her painting might have been more harmonious. Keeping all other elements the same, and doubling the total number of strokes for her painting just like before, she wonders how many strokes would there have been in her painting if she had made this change. How many strokes would there have been?
