However, since he cannot divide the doubloons into fractions, he will have to give some crew members an extra doubloon.

To find out how many doubloons each crew member will get, we can round down the number of doubloons per crew member to the nearest whole number, which is 5. Then, we can distribute the remaining 1 doubloon (36 - 7*5 = 1) to one of the crew members.

Therefore, 6 crew members will get 5 doubloons each, and 1 crew member will get 6 doubloons.

To make each individual earring, she will need 7/5 = &lt;&lt;7/5=1.4&gt;&gt;1.4 beads.
Since she wants to make 2 earrings, she will need 2 \* 1.4 = &lt;&lt;2\*1.4=2.8&gt;&gt;2.8 beads in total.

The spell is divided into 6 equal periods, so each period is 59/6 = &lt;&lt;59/6=9.833333333333334&gt;&gt;9.833333333333334 minutes long.
However, since the spell cannot be divided into fractions of a minute, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, each period of the spell is 9 minutes long.
