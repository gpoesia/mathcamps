        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's denote the number of beds donated by the sponsor as x. According to the information given, the number of remaining beds (20) plus the number of donated beds (x) equals the original number of beds (75).

So, we have the equation: 20 + x = 75

To find the value of x, we can solve for x:

x = 75 - 20
x = &lt;&lt;75-20=55&gt;&gt;55

Therefore, the sponsor donated 55 beds.

            Let's revisit the previous situation where bees were settling in a cluster of trees. Suppose we made a mistake earlier and wrongly counted the bees. In fact, originally, there were 72 bees in the cluster of trees.

Now, similar to the previous situation, after some time, the number of bees in the cluster of trees equals the number of bees from the roses and daisies subtracted from this correct number in the cluster.

Given this correction, how many bees are now left in the cluster of trees?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total number of bees in the field is still 25 + 25 = &lt;&lt;25+25=50&gt;&gt;50 bees.
The number of bees in the cluster of trees after some time is the corrected original number of bees in the cluster minus the number of bees in the field.
So, the number of bees in the cluster of trees after some time is 72 - 50 = &lt;&lt;72-50=22&gt;&gt;22 bees.

If originally, the manufacturer had 52 binoculars, but this time only 13 were defective and had to be removed from the stock. The manufacturer maintains their commitment to compensate for defects by producing the same number of binoculars the next day. Now, how many binoculars does the manufacturer have in this case?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: From the previous problem, we know that there were 11 kites sold before the festival started.
So, the number of kites remaining from the initial batch of 91 kites is 91 - 11 = &lt;&lt;91-11=80&gt;&gt;80 kites.
The second booth sold the same number of kites as the number of kites remaining from the initial batch, which is 80 kites.
The second booth initially had 59 kites, so after selling 80 kites, they would have 59 - 80 = &lt;&lt;59-80=-21&gt;&gt;-21 kites left.
However, since it is not possible to have a negative number of kites, this means that the second booth sold more kites than they initially had.
Therefore, the second booth had 0 kites left after these sales.

            A jeweler had 90 rings in their inventory. They sold 25 rings in the morning. In the afternoon, they realized their inventory was 92 rings short of their target for the day. How many rings are they short right now for reaching their target?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The jeweler started with 90 rings and sold 25 in the morning, leaving them with 90-25 = &lt;&lt;90-25=65&gt;&gt;65 rings.
They are 92 rings short of their target for the day, so they need 65+92 = &lt;&lt;65+92=157&gt;&gt;157 rings to reach their target.
Since they currently have 65 rings, they are 157-65 = &lt;&lt;157-65=92&gt;&gt;92 rings short of their target right now.

So, in total, there are 26+22 = &lt;&lt;26+22=48&gt;&gt;48 carrot seeds in your carrot spot.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            You have a vegetable garden with a special spot dedicated to growing carrots. Initially, you planted 26 carrot seeds. A few weeks later, you added 22 more seeds. How many carrot seeds are there in total? 

Now, your neighbor gives you an additional same number of carrot seeds as the ones you initially planted (26 seeds). After adding these seeds too, how many carrot seeds do you have in total?

            In the previous problem, you initially planted 26 carrot seeds in your vegetable garden. But imagine if instead, you initially put 55 carrot seeds. And then a few weeks later, you added the same 22 more seeds. How many carrot seeds would there be in total in that case?

            At a beach party, there are 21 beach balls being played with. Suddenly, another batch of beach balls just as big as the first one arrived. How many beach balls are there at the party now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The question does not provide information on the number of beach balls in the second batch. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the total number of beach balls at the party now.
