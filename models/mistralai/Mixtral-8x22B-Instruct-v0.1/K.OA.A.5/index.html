        A compass starts pointing north, makes a full spin with 3 complete rotations, and then is spun back by 1 rotation in the same direction. How many total spins from its original position is the compass pointing at now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: A full spin is 360 degrees, so 3 complete rotations is 3 \* 360 = &lt;&lt;3\*360=1080&gt;&gt;1080 degrees.
Spinning back by 1 rotation is 360 degrees, so the total degrees spun is 1080 - 360 = &lt;&lt;1080-360=720&gt;&gt;720 degrees.
Since a full spin is 360 degrees, the compass is pointing at 720 / 360 = &lt;&lt;720/360=2&gt;&gt;2 full spins from its original position.

        A truck has 1 headlight on the left. It has another 1 headlight on the right. This makes a set. The truck has another similar set of headlights on the back. 

After going off-road, 3 of the headlights were damaged beyond repair and are now useless. 

How many working headlights does the truck have left now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The truck originally had 4 headlights in total.
After going off-road, 3 of the headlights were damaged beyond repair and are now useless.
Therefore, the truck has 4 - 3 = &lt;&lt;4-3=1&gt;&gt;1 working headlight left now.

        Let's say originally before James and his brother started their actions, there were not 2 but 4 socks under the bed. If James still picks up 1 sock and puts it in the laundry basket, how many socks would be left under the bed then?

        There are 3 birds singing in the forest. Then, 1 bird flies away. After a while, the same number of squirrels come and join the two remaining birds. How many animals are there in total in the forest now?
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: There are 3-1 = &lt;&lt;3-1=2&gt;&gt;2 birds left in the forest.
The same number of squirrels join the birds, so there are 2 squirrels.
There are 2 birds + 2 squirrels = &lt;&lt;2+2=4&gt;&gt;4 animals in total in the forest now.
