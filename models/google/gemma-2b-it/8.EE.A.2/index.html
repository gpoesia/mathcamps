We are given that V = 216 m^3.
We are also given that the width and height are equal.
Therefore, we can write the equation 216 = length * width * height.
Solving for the length, we get length = 216 / width * height.
Substituting the values of V, width and height, we get length = 216 / width * width = 216.

Therefore, the length of the object is inversely proportional to the cube of its length.
If the temperature at the heart of the object is 729 degrees, and the length is x units, then the length in units is inversely proportional to the cube of x, or x^âˆ’3.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of a cuboid is given by the formula V = length * width * height.
We are given V = 8 m^3 and two of the dimensions are the same length. Let x be the length of the side.
Then the width is also x.
Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
8 = x * x = x^2
Therefore, x = 2 m.
The length of a side of the cubical cargo space is 2 m.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = a^3, where a is the length of one edge of the cube.
Therefore, a = &lt;V^(1/3)&gt; = &lt;729^(1/3)&gt; cm.
### Answer: 15 cm</pre>
