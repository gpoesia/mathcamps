    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let x be the length of the third side. Then the two known sides are 828m and 10m.
The perimeter is 934m, so we have:
x + 828m + 10m = 934m
x = 934m - 828m - 10m = &lt;&lt;104m&gt;&gt;104m

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula P = 3s, where P is the perimeter and s is the length of each side.
Substituting the values, we get 537 = 3s.
Solving for s, we get s = 179.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of its three sides.
Therefore, 568 = 110 + 205.
