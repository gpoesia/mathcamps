        In the above comparison you made between 2 and 9, now let's change the second number. Suppose we change the number 9 to 4. Compare them using the symbols &lt;, &gt;, or =. So, the new equation to solve will be:

2 _ 4

        In the previous statement, you compared the numbers 8 and 7. Now consider a different scenario: 

Fill in the blank in the statement 
5 _ 7
with either a &lt;, &gt;, or = sign to compare the numbers. How does this comparison differ from the earlier one?
