        A big grizzly bear feasts on 2726 ounces of salmon during a 58-day summer period. How much salmon does the bear eat each day on average?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The average daily consumption can be calculated by dividing the total amount of food eaten by the number of days it was consumed.
Therefore, the average daily consumption = 2726/58 = &lt;&lt;48.3 ounces&gt;&gt;48.3 ounces of salmon.</pre>

        A farmer has two patches of land. One patch yields 26 carrots and the other yields 16 carrots. If every day for 77 days, the farmer collects the same amount of carrots, how many carrots has the farmer collected in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The farmer collects the same amount of carrots from each patch every day, so the total number of carrots collected in 77 days is the same for both patches.
The total number of carrots collected = 26 carrots from the first patch + 16 carrots from the second patch = &lt;&lt;26+16=42&gt;&gt;42 carrots.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total distance traveled is directly proportional to the speed of the train.
Therefore, the total distance traveled at 68 mph is 68 * 21 = &lt;&lt;68*21=1488&gt;&gt;1488 miles.
The total distance traveled at 28 mph is 28 * 21 = &lt;&lt;28*21=584&gt;&gt;584 miles.
The impact on the total distance traveled is 1488 - 584 = &lt;&lt;1488-584=904&gt;&gt;904 miles.

Therefore, the player needs 58.33 increments to gain the points required to complete the level.</pre>
