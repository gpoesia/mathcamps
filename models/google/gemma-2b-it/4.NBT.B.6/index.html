            A windmill generates 506 units of power per day. Every day, a small village consumes power in increments of 385 units. At the end of the day, after the village has consumed as much power as it can in full increments, how much power is left over?

Therefore, the windmill generates more power than the village consumes, resulting in a power surplus of 506 - 385 = &lt;&lt;121&gt;&gt;121 units of power at the end of the day.

            Following the scenario of the windmill and the small village, let's now consider that the windmill had a great day and managed to generate 506 units of power. However, due to development demands, the daily consumption of the village has increased to 920 units. At the end of the day, with the power being consumed in complete units, how much power is left over?
