            In a math class, students have to draw shapes based on certain numeric conditions. One student starts by rotating an angle to form 92 degrees. Then, he rotates the same angle by an additional 84 degrees. This gives him shape 't'. He modifies shape 't' by rotating another 90 degrees and labels this as shape 'l'. Finally, he rotates it by another 66 degrees to form shape 'n'. What is the total degree measure of the rotations made to get shape 'n'?
