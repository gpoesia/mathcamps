            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The energy drink increased his jogging speed by 50/49 = &lt;&lt;50/49&gt;&gt;50/49 times his original speed.
Without the energy drink, his jogging speed was 4/22 miles per hour.
With the energy drink, his jogging speed was 50/49 * 4/22 = &lt;&lt;50/49 * 4/22=50/49&gt;&gt;50/49 times his original speed.
Therefore, if he continued for 46/30 hours, his jogging speed would be 50/49 * 4/22 * 46/30 = &lt;&lt;50/49 * 4/22 * 46/30=50/49&gt;&gt;50/49.</pre>

How much money will John have in his investment account after a year?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: After a certain period of time, John will have 29 + 20(n) dollars, where n is the number of weeks. 

After a year, the investment account will return 41/11 times 29 + 20(n). 

Therefore, after a year, John's investment account will have:

29 + 20n = 41/11(29 + 20n)

Solving for n, we get:

441 = 1070 + 840n

n = 10

Therefore, after a year, John will have $29 + 20(10) = $140 in his investment account.</pre>

After adding the money he found on the floor, he duplicated the amount of money he had by 43 times, which is 43 * $13/10 = $579/10.
