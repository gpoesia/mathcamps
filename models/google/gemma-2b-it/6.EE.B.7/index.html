        A luxurious watch costs $422. If the manufacturing cost is $200, how much is charged for brand value, sales profits, and other overheads?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The brand value is 422 - 200 = &lt;&lt;422-200=222&gt;&gt;222.
The sales profits are 422 - 200 = &lt;&lt;422-200=222&gt;&gt;222.
The other overheads are 422 - 200 - 222 = &lt;&lt;422-200-222=80&gt;&gt;80.
Therefore, the total cost is 422 + 222 + 80 = &lt;&lt;422+222+80=624&gt;&gt;624.
