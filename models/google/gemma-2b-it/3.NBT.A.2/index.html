        Following up on the previous question about the farmer losing some carrot plants to a hailstorm. Let's consider a scenario where the farmer had initially planted 737 carrot plants in the first field, instead of 746. If the same 91 carrot plants were planted in the second field, how many carrot plants would the farmer have in total then, before the hailstorm hit?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total number of carrot plants = 737 - 91 = &lt;&lt;737-91=646&gt;&gt;646.
