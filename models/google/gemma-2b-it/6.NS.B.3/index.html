    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The distance the snowball covered past the tree before it hit the ground can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: distance^2 = distance from tree^2 + distance to target^2.
Distance from tree^2 = 24.6^2 = 590.52
Distance to target^2 = 50.23^2 = 254.00
Distance covered = sqrt(590.52 + 254.00) = &lt;&lt;sqrt(844.52)=29.06&gt;&gt;29.06 meters.
