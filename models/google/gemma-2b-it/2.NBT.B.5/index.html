            In a revision of the initial inventory, the toy store realizes there was a mistake and they originally only had 1 teddy bear in stock, not 28. But they did receive a shipment of 10 more teddy bears as mentioned before. Then, they received the shipment of 49 more teddy bears, as in the original scenario. How many teddy bears do they have in stock now after correcting the initial inventory error and receiving all the shipments?
