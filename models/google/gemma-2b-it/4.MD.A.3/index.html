Then, the length of the rectangle is 2x.
The area of the square is x^2.
The area of the rectangle is 2x^2.
Since the rectangle has twice the length of the square, we have 2x = x^2.
Solving for x, we get x = 7.
Therefore, the side of the square is 49m, and the length of the rectangle is 2 * 49 = 98m.</pre>
