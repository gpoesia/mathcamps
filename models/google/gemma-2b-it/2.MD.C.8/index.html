        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John started with $73, received $14, so he had $73-14 = &lt;&lt;$73-14=$59&gt;&gt;59 in total.
He then spent $63 on a video game, so he had $59-63 = &lt;&lt;$59-63=$-4&gt;&gt;-4 in total.
Therefore, John has $59 in total after buying the video game.
