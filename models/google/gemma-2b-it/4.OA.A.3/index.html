            A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The number of penguins counted on the first ice floe was 35.
The number of penguins counted on the second ice floe was 598 divided by 26 = &lt;&lt;26&gt;&gt;26.
After taking 33 more penguins into account, she had 35 + 33 - 10 = &lt;&lt;35+33-10&gt;&gt;35+33-10.
The final number of penguins counted was 35+33-10 = &lt;&lt;35+33-10&gt;&gt;35+33-10.

On the other hand, they made a special batch of 13 towels for every towel left after their charity activity and deducted 19 towels from this special batch, calling it their premium collection. They then noted 20 towels were damaged and removed it from this premium collection. 

After this, they deducted 3 more towels from the remaining premium collection and combined it with the total they had after their second batch of production.

            A park contains 43 Velociraptors. Then, the park added another set of dinosaurs which numbered 972, but as it so happens, each of these sections contained 27 dinosaurs.

            There's this mystical ring that, after you perform a special chant, it will grant you powers based on a complex magic formula. If the first step of the magical formula is subtracting 5 from 23 and then multiplying by the number of magical chants you perform, which in this case is 6. After that, the result is multiplied by 7 and again by 1. However, for the final step, you subtract 48 from the result. If you follow these steps, how powerful will the ring's magic be?

            A jewelry maker starts with 38 beads to make a bracelet. However, the number of beads was not right, so she removed a number of beads equal to dividing 560 by 40. However, she thinks her initial count may have been wrong and she may have actually started with 15 more beads than she initially thought. After adjusting the count and removing some beads, she adds one more bead, and then 39 more. How many beads does the jewelry maker have now?

            A wizard casts a spell that produces 882 glimmering lights over a span of 21 days. That's an average of how many lights a day?

In comparison, another wizard casts a spell that produces 460 glowing orbs in 20 days. What is the daily average here?

Now, let's assume that the difference in their daily averages times the second wizard's daily average is a magical constant represented by 'n'. Can you find out what 'n' is?

The difference is approximately equal to the number of days the second wizard worked. Therefore, we can assume that the difference is equal to 'n'.
Hence, n = 422.
So, the daily average of the second wizard is 460/20 = &lt;&lt;460/20=23&gt;&gt;23 lights.</pre>

In parallel, in the packaging department, they have 50 empty boxes. They use 19 of them for another department, leaving them with (50 - 19) boxes.

            A gardener planted 13 Sunflowers in his garden. The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed. By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on and the spots needed, then he doubled that total for no particular reason. How many did he end up with?

            A treasure chest contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds. Unfortunately, 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed. The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest. 

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

What is the value (m) of the remaining treasure?

            The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

            An orange farm produced 2 times the 28 pounds of oranges they typically produce in a single day due to a new method. This production also multiplied by the 15 days of the harvest period. If the farm then added 16 pounds of a rare orange variant to this harvest, how much did the farm produce in total?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The farm produced 2 * 28 = &lt;&lt;2 * 28=56&gt;&gt;56 pounds of oranges in a single day.
The farm produced 56 * 15 = &lt;&lt;56 * 15=840&gt;&gt;840 pounds of oranges in the harvest period.
The farm produced 56 + 16 = &lt;&lt;56+16=72&gt;&gt;72 pounds of a rare orange variant in total.

            A bus has 37 passengers. At the next stop, 20 more passengers get on. Before the bus reaches to the next stop, 44 passengers get off. Now, suppose this remaining number of passengers each pays an $11 fare, but the bus company also deducts a $14 service fee from the total fare. How much revenue does the bus company get?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The number of passengers who get on and off is irrelevant to the total revenue.
Before the bus reaches the next stop, 37+20 = &lt;&lt;37+20=57&gt;&gt;57 passengers remain.
44 passengers get off, so the remaining passengers are 37-57 = &lt;&lt;37-57=-20&gt;&gt;-20.
The bus company collects 37-20 = &lt;&lt;37-20=17&gt;&gt;17 fare from the remaining passengers.
The total revenue is 37+20-44 = &lt;&lt;37+20-44=17&gt;&gt;17.
