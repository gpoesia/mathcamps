        There are 73841 cubic centimeters of air needed to inflate a large beach ball. If we fill the ball up at a rate of 41 cubic centimeters per second, how many seconds will it take to fully inflate the beach ball?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of the ball is given by the formula V = &lt;&lt;(4/3)πr³&gt;&gt;V = &lt;&lt;(4/3)π(10 cm)³&gt;&gt;V = 1000π cm³.
The time taken to fully inflate the ball is given by the formula t = V/r = 1000π cm³/(10 cm/s) = &lt;&lt;1000π/10=100π&gt;&gt; seconds.
