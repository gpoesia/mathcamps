        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of an irregular polygon is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
Therefore, 23m + 67m + 57m + 94m + 93m + 18m + 30m = 419m.
Solving for the missing side, we get 23m + 67m + 57m = 419m - 18m = 401m.
