Reasoning: The weight of the treasure chest is 14.755650000000001 kg. The value of 10.81 kg per seashell is equivalent to 10.81 kg/shell. Therefore, the number of seashells in the treasure chest is equal to 14.755650000000001/10.81 = &lt;&lt;14.755650000000001/10.81&gt;&gt; 16 seashells.

            Following the decrease in the sun's temperature, scientists observe that for every degree decrease, solar energy reaching Earth reduces by 7.6%. How much has the solar energy reduced by, when the sun's temperature dropped from 18.22 million degrees Fahrenheit to 14.558 million degrees Fahrenheit?
