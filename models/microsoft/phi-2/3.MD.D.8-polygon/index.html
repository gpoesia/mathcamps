|user| A group of friends went to a restaurant and ordered a total of 12 pizzas. Each pizza was cut into 8 slices. If each person ate 2 slices, how many people were in the group?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The total number of slices is 12*8 = &lt;&lt;12*8=96&gt;&gt;96 slices.
If each person ate 2 slices, then the number of people in the group is 96/2 = &lt;&lt;96/2=48&gt;&gt;48 people.

|user| A rectangular garden has a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet. If the garden is expanded by increasing both the length and width by the same amount, and the new area of the garden is 600 square feet, what is the increase in length and width?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The original area of the garden is 20*15 = &lt;&lt;20*15=300&gt;&gt;300 square feet.
Let x be the increase in length and width. Then the new length is 20+x and the new width is 15+x. The new area is (20+x)*(15+x) = 600.
Expanding and simplifying, we get x^2 + 35x - 300 = 0.
Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get x = (-35 Â± sqrt(35^2 + 4*300))/2 = (-35 Â± sqrt(1225))/2 = (-35 Â± 35sqrt(5))/2.
Since x must be positive, we take the positive root: x = (-35 + 35sqrt(5))/2.
Therefore, the increase in length and width is approximately 3.5 feet.
### Answer: 3.5

|user| A triangle has sides of length 5cm, 12cm and 13cm. What is the area of the triangle?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The area of a triangle can be calculated using Heron's formula, which states that the area of a triangle with sides of length a, b and c is given by the square root of s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c), where s is the semiperimeter of the triangle, defined as (a+b+c)/2.
In this case, s = (5+12+13)/2 = 15, so the area of the triangle is sqrt(15(15-5)(15-12)(15-13)) = sqrt(15*10*3*2) = sqrt(900) = 30sqrt(2) cm^2.
### Answer: 30sqrt(2)
