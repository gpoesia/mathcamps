|user| A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to plant corn in the field, but he needs to leave a 10-meter-wide border around the field for a fence. How many square meters of the field can he plant with corn?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The farmer needs to subtract the area of the border from the area of the field. The area of the field is 120*80 = &lt;&lt;120*80=9600&gt;&gt;9600 square meters. The area of the border is (120+20)*(80+20) - 120*80 = &lt;&lt;(120+20)*(80+20)-120*80=19200&gt;&gt;19200 square meters. The area of the field that can be planted with corn is 9600-19200 = &lt;&lt;9600-19200=-12000&gt;&gt;-12000 square meters.

|user| A student has a total of $50 in quarters, dimes, and nickels. If she has twice as many quarters as dimes and three times as many nickels as dimes, how many of each coin does she have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let x be the number of dimes. Then the number of quarters is 2x and the number of nickels is 3x. The total value of the coins is 0.25(2x) + 0.10x + 0.05(3x) = $50. Simplifying this equation gives 0.45x = $50, so x = $50/$0.45 = 111.11. Since x must be a whole number, we round down to get x = 111. Therefore, the student has 222 quarters, 222 dimes, and 333 nickels.
### Answer: 222 quarters, 222 dimes, 333 nickels

|user| A farmer has a rectangular field that is 60 meters long and 40 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field, but he only has enough material to build a fence that is 100 meters long. What is the maximum width of the field that the farmer can fence?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The perimeter of the field is 2(60+40) = &lt;&lt;2(60+40)=200&gt;&gt;200 meters.
If the farmer uses 100 meters of material to build the fence, then the remaining material can be used to build a fence that is 100-60 = &lt;&lt;100-60=40&gt;&gt;40 meters long.
The maximum width of the field that the farmer can fence is 40/2 = &lt;&lt;40/2=20&gt;&gt;20 meters.

|user| A company has a total of $10,000 to spend on advertising. They want to spend twice as much on television ads as on radio ads. How much money should they spend on each type of ad?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let x be the amount of money spent on radio ads. Then the amount of money spent on television ads is 2x.
The total amount of money spent on both types of ads is x+2x = 3x.
We know that the total amount of money spent is $10,000, so 3x = 10,000.
Solving for x, we get x = $&lt;&lt;10000/3=3333.33&gt;&gt;3333.33.
Therefore, the company should spend $3333.33 on radio ads and $6666.67 on television ads.
### Answer: $3333.33 for radio ads, $6666.67 for television ads.

|user| A system of equations is given by:
|assistant| x + y = 10
|x - y = 2
### Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together.
x + y + x - y = 10 + 2
2x = 12
x = 6
### Substituting x = 6 into one of the equations, we get:
6 + y = 10
y = 4
### Answer: x = 6, y = 4
###
|user| A system of equations is given by:
|assistant| 2x + 3y = 11
|4x - y = 5
### Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 3 and adding it to the first equation.
2x + 3y + 12x - 3y = 11 + 15
14x = 26
x = 26/14 = 13/7
### Substituting x = 13/7 into one of the equations, we get:
2(13/7) + 3y = 11
3y = 11 - 26/7
3y = (77 - 26)/7
3y = 51/7
y = 17/7
### Answer: x = 13/7, y = 17/7
###
|user| A system of equations is given by:

### Reasoning: We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the second equation by 2 and adding it to the first equation.
3x + 2y + 4x - 2y = 8 + 2
7x = 10
x = 10/7
### Substituting x = 10/7 into one of the equations, we get:
3(10/7) + 2y = 8
2y = 8 - 30/7
2y = (56 - 30)/7
2y = 26/7
y = 13/7

|user| A bakery sells cupcakes for $2 each and muffins for $3 each. In one day, the bakery sells 120 cupcakes and 80 muffins. How much money does the bakery make in one day if it gives a 10% discount on all cupcakes?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The revenue from selling cupcakes is 120 x 2 = &lt;&lt;120*2=240&gt;&gt;240 dollars.
The revenue from selling muffins is 80 x 3 = &lt;&lt;80*3=240&gt;&gt;240 dollars.
The total revenue from selling cupcakes and muffins is 240+240 = &lt;&lt;240+240=480&gt;&gt;480 dollars.
The discount on cupcakes is 10% of 240 = 0.1 x 240 = &lt;&lt;0.1*240=24&gt;&gt;24 dollars.
The revenue from selling cupcakes after the discount is 240 - 24 = &lt;&lt;240-24=216&gt;&gt;216 dollars.
The total revenue from selling cupcakes and muffins after the discount is 216+240 = &lt;&lt;216+240=456&gt;&gt;456 dollars.

|user| A group of friends are playing a game of snowball fight. They each make a certain number of snowballs. The total number of snowballs made by the group is 576. If one friend made twice as many snowballs as another friend, how many snowballs did each friend make?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let x be the number of snowballs made by the friend who made half as many as the other friend. Then the other friend made 2x snowballs. The total number of snowballs made is x+2x=3x=576. Solving for x, we get x=192. Therefore, the friend who made half as many made 192/2=&lt;&lt;192/2=96&gt;&gt;96 snowballs, and the other friend made 2x=384 snowballs.
### Answer: Friend who made half as many made 96 snowballs, and the other friend made 384 snowballs.

###|assistant| Reasoning: Let x be the number of snowballs made by the friend who made half as many as the other friend. Then the other friend made 2x snowballs. The third friend made x/2 snowballs. The total number of snowballs made is x+2x+x/2=3x/2=576. Solving for x, we get x=384. Therefore, the friend who made half as many made 192/2=96 snowballs, the other friend made 2x=384 snowballs, and the third friend made x/2=192 snowballs.

|user| A farmer has a total of 576 chickens and ducks on his farm. The number of chickens is twice the number of ducks. How many chickens and ducks does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of ducks is x. Then the number of chickens is 2x. The total number of chickens and ducks is x+2x=3x. We know that 3x=576, so x=192. Therefore, the farmer has 192 ducks and 384 chickens.
### Answer: 192 ducks, 384 chickens
###
|user| A store sells two types of pens, ballpoint and gel. The ratio of ballpoint pens to gel pens sold is 3:5. If the store sold a total of 320 pens, how many ballpoint pens were sold?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of ballpoint pens sold is 3x. Then the number of gel pens sold is 5x. The total number of pens sold is 3x+5x=8x. We know that 8x=320, so x=40. Therefore, the store sold 3x=&lt;&lt;3*40=120&gt;&gt;120 ballpoint pens.
### Answer: 120 ballpoint pens

|user| A farmer has a total of 576 chickens and ducks. If the number of chickens is 3 times the number of ducks, how many chickens and ducks does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of ducks is x. Then, the number of chickens is 3x.
The total number of chickens and ducks is x + 3x = 4x.
We know that 4x = 576, so x = 144.
Therefore, the farmer has 144 ducks and 3x = 3(144) = 432 chickens.

|user| A store sold a total of 120 items in a day. If they sold twice as many shirts as pants, how many shirts did they sell?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of pants sold is x. Then, the number of shirts sold is 2x.
The total number of items sold is x + 2x = 120.
Combining like terms, we get 3x = 120.
Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 40.
Therefore, the store sold 2x = 2(40) = 80 shirts.
### Answer: 80

|user| A farmer has a total of 60 cows and chickens on his farm. If the number of cows is twice the number of chickens, how many cows does he have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of chickens is x. Then, the number of cows is 2x.
The total number of animals is x + 2x = 60.
Combining like terms, we get 3x = 60.
Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 20.
Therefore, the farmer has 2x = 2(20) = 40 cows.

The total number of employees is x + 3x = 500.
Combining like terms, we get 4x = 500.
Dividing both sides by 4, we find x = 125.
Therefore, the company has 3x = 3(125) = 375 male employees.

|user| A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to plant corn on the field, but he needs to leave a 10-meter-wide border around the field for a fence. How many square meters of the field can he plant with corn?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The area of the field is 120*80 = &lt;&lt;120*80=9600&gt;&gt;9600 square meters.
The area of the border is (120+20)*(80+20) - 120*80 = &lt;&lt;(120+20)*(80+20)-120*80=19200&gt;&gt;19200 square meters.
The area of the corn field is 9600 - 19200 = &lt;&lt;9600-19200=-11200&gt;&gt;-11200 square meters.

|user| A farmer has a triangular field that has a base of 60 meters and a height of 40 meters. He wants to plant corn on the field, but he needs to leave a 5-meter-wide border around the field for a fence. How many square meters of the field can he plant with corn?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The area of the field is (60*40)/2 = &lt;&lt;(60*40)/2=1200&gt;&gt;1200 square meters.
The area of the border is (60+10)*(40+10) - 60*40 = &lt;&lt;(60+10)*(40+10)-60*40=1400&gt;&gt;1400 square meters.
The area of the corn field is 1200 - 1400 = &lt;&lt;1200-1400=-200&gt;&gt;-200 square meters.

|user| Oscar has a bag of marbles that contains 36 red marbles, 24 blue marbles, and 12 green marbles. He wants to divide them equally among his three friends. How many marbles of each color will each friend get?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Oscar has a total of 36+24+12 = &lt;&lt;36+24+12=72&gt;&gt;72 marbles. He will give each friend 72/3 = &lt;&lt;72/3=24&gt;&gt;24 marbles. To find out how many marbles of each color each friend will get, we can use the ratio of the colors. The ratio of red to blue to green is 36:24:12, which can be simplified to 3:2:1. Therefore, each friend will get 3/6 * 24 = &lt;&lt;3/6*24=12&gt;&gt;12 red marbles, 2/6 * 24 = &lt;&lt;2/6*24=8&gt;&gt;8 blue marbles, and 1/6 * 24 = &lt;&lt;1/6*24=4&gt;&gt;4 green marbles.

|user| A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to fence the field with wire. How many meters of wire does he need?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The farmer needs to fence the four sides of the field. The length of the wire needed for the longer sides is 120 meters, and the length of the wire needed for the shorter sides is 80 meters. Therefore, the total length of wire needed is 120 + 120 + 80 + 80 = &lt;&lt;120+120+80+80=400&gt;&gt;400 meters.

|user| A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each. If a customer buys 4 apples and 3 oranges, how much does the customer pay?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The customer pays 4 x $0.50 = $&lt;&lt;4*0.5=2&gt;&gt;2 for the apples, and 3 x $0.75 = $&lt;&lt;3*0.75=2.25&gt;&gt;2.25 for the oranges. Therefore, the customer pays $2 + $2.25 = $&lt;&lt;2+2.25=4.25&gt;&gt;4.25 in total.

            After the city water treatment plant processes 391 million gallons of water during the day and an additional 176 million gallons at night, the nearby factory requests that an additional 303 million gallons be processed for their industrial needs. How many total gallons of water will the plant need to process to meet all these requirements?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The plant already processes 391 million + 176 million = &lt;&lt;391+176=567&gt;&gt;567 million gallons of water. To meet the factory's request, the plant needs to process an additional 303 million gallons. Therefore, the total number of gallons the plant needs to process is 567 + 303 = &lt;&lt;567+303=870&gt;&gt;870 million gallons.

            Suppose after careful review, it was discovered that the city water treatment plant actually processed 438 million gallons of water during the day, and not the originally reported 391 million gallons, while still processing an additional 176 million gallons at night. How many total gallons of water did the plant process considering this revised daytime figure?

|user| A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to fence the field with wire. However, he only has enough wire to fence the perimeter of the field. How many meters of wire does he need?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The perimeter of the field is 2 x (120 + 80) = &lt;&lt;2*(120+80)=400&gt;&gt;400 meters. Therefore, the farmer needs 400 meters of wire.

|user| A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each. If a customer buys 4 apples and 3 oranges, but the store gives a 10% discount on the total purchase, how much does the customer pay?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The customer pays 4 x $0.50 = $&lt;&lt;4*0.5=2&gt;&gt;2 for the apples, and 3 x $0.75 = $&lt;&lt;3*0.75=2.25&gt;&gt;2.25 for the oranges. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is $2 + $2.25 = $&lt;&lt;2+2.25=4.25&gt;&gt;4.25. The discount is 10% of $4.25, which is 0.1 x $4.25 = $&lt;&lt;0.1*4.25=0.425&gt;&gt;0.425. Therefore, the customer pays $4.25 - $0.425 = $&lt;&lt;4.25-0.425=3.825&gt;&gt;3.825 in total.
### Answer: $3.825
###
|user| A car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour. If the car travels for 2.5 hours, but then has to slow down to 40 miles per hour for the next hour due to traffic, how far does the car travel in total?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The car travels 60 x 2.5 = &lt;&lt;60*2.5=150&gt;&gt;150 miles at 60 miles per hour. Then, the car travels 40 x 1 = &lt;&lt;40*1=40&gt;&gt;40 miles at 40 miles per hour. Therefore, the car travels 150 + 40 = &lt;&lt;150+40=190&gt;&gt;190 miles in total.

###|assistant| Reasoning: The amount of money left after paying for salaries and rent is $1,000,000 - $350,000 - $200,000 = &lt;&lt;1000000-350000-200000=550000&gt;&gt;550,000.

|user| A farmer has a total of 60 cows and chickens on his farm. The number of cows is twice the number of chickens. How many cows and chickens does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of chickens is x. Then the number of cows is 2x.
The total number of cows and chickens is x + 2x = 3x.
We know that the total number of cows and chickens is 60, so 3x = 60.
Solving for x, we get x = 20.
Therefore, the farmer has 20 chickens and 2x = 40 cows.
### Answer: The farmer has 40 cows and 20 chickens.

|user| A farmer has a total of 789 chickens and ducks on his farm. If the number of chickens is 3 times the number of ducks, how many chickens and ducks does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let x be the number of ducks. Then the number of chickens is 3x. The total number of chickens and ducks is x+3x=4x, which is equal to 789. Solving for x, we get x=197.25. Since we cannot have a fraction of an animal, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer has 197 ducks and 3*197=591 chickens.
### Answer: 197 ducks, 591 chickens

|user| A store sells a total of 576 items. If the store sells twice as many shirts as pants, and three times as many pants as shoes, how many shirts, pants, and shoes does the store sell?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let x be the number of shoes. Then the number of pants is 3x, and the number of shirts is 2(3x) = 6x. The total number of items is x+3x+6x = 10x. We know that 10x=576, so x=57.6. However, we cannot have a fraction of a shoe, so we round up to 58. Therefore, the store sells 58 shoes, 3(58) = 174 pants, and 6(58) = 348 shirts.

|user| A farmer has a total of 120 chickens and ducks. If the number of chickens is twice the number of ducks, how many chickens and ducks does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of ducks is x. Then, the number of chickens is 2x.
The total number of chickens and ducks is x + 2x = 120.
Combining like terms, we get 3x = 120.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 40.
Therefore, the farmer has 40 ducks and 2x = 2(40) = 80 chickens.
### Answer: The farmer has 80 chickens and 40 ducks.
###
|user| A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each. If a customer buys 4 apples and 3 oranges, how much does the customer spend in total?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $0.50 = $&lt;&lt;4*0.50=2&gt;&gt;2.
The cost of 3 oranges is 3 * $0.75 = $&lt;&lt;3*0.75=2.25&gt;&gt;2.25.
Therefore, the customer spends $2 + $2.25 = $&lt;&lt;2+2.25=4.25&gt;&gt;4.25 in total.
### Answer: The customer spends $4.25 in total.
###
|user| A car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour. How far will the car travel in 3 hours?

|user| A recipe calls for 3 eggs and 2 cups of flour. If you want to make 4 times the recipe, how many eggs and cups of flour do you need?
###|assistant| Reasoning: To make 4 times the recipe, we need to multiply the amounts of eggs and flour by 4.
Therefore, we need 3 * 4 = &lt;&lt;3*4=12&gt;&gt;12 eggs and 2 * 4 = &lt;&lt;2*4=8&gt;&gt;8 cups of flour.
### Answer: We need 12 eggs and 8 cups of flour.

The cost of 3 pants is 3 * $30 = $&lt;&lt;3*30=90&gt;&gt;90.
Therefore, the customer spends $40 + $90 = $&lt;&lt;40+90=130&gt;&gt;130 in total.
### Answer: The customer spends $130 in total.

|user| A farmer has a total of 120 chickens and ducks. If the number of chickens is twice the number of ducks, how many chickens and ducks does the farmer have?
###|assistant| Reasoning: Let's assume the number of ducks is x. Then, the number of chickens is 2x.
The total number of chickens and ducks is x + 2x = 120.
Combining like terms, we get 3x = 120.

|user| A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to plant corn on the field, but he needs to leave a 10-meter-wide border around the field for a fence. How many square meters of the field can he plant with corn?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The area of the field is 120*80 = &lt;&lt;120*80=9600&gt;&gt;9600 square meters. The area of the border is (120+20)*(80+20) - 120*80 = &lt;&lt;(120+20)*(80+20)-120*80=19200&gt;&gt;19200 square meters. The area of the corn field is 9600 - 19200 = &lt;&lt;9600-19200=-11200&gt;&gt;-11200 square meters.
### Answer: -11200

|user| A car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours, then it slows down to 40 km/h for 1 hour, then it speeds up to 80 km/h for 0.5 hour. What is the average speed of the car for the whole trip?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The total distance traveled by the car is 60*2 + 40*1 + 80*0.5 = &lt;&lt;60*2+40*1+80*0.5=160&gt;&gt;160 km. The total time taken by the car is 2+1+0.5 = &lt;&lt;2+1+0.5=3.5&gt;&gt;3.5 hours. The average speed of the car is 160/3.5 = &lt;&lt;160/3.5=45.71&gt;&gt;45.71 km/h.
