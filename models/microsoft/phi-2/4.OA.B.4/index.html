|user| A car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours, then at 80 km/h for 1.5 hours. How far does the car travel in total?
###|assistant| Reasoning: To find the total distance traveled by the car, we need to add the distances traveled at each speed. The distance traveled at a constant speed is given by the formula d = s * t, where d is the distance, s is the speed, and t is the time.
### Answer: The distance traveled at 60 km/h for 2 hours is 60 * 2 = 120 km.
The distance traveled at 80 km/h for 1.5 hours is 80 * 1.5 = 120 km.
The total distance traveled by the car is 120 + 120 = 240 km.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: A factor pair is a pair of numbers that multiply to give a certain number. To find all factor pairs of 81, we can start by listing the factors of 81, which are 1, 3, 9, 27, and 81. Then, we can pair them up in different ways, such as (1, 81), (3, 27), (9, 9), and (27, 3).

|user| A car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours, then at 80 km/h for 1.5 hours. How far does the car travel in total?
###|assistant| Reasoning: To find the total distance traveled by the car, we need to add the distances traveled at each speed. The distance traveled at a constant speed is given by the formula d = s * t, where d is the distance, s is the speed, and t is the time. So, the distance traveled at 60 km/h for 2 hours is 60 * 2 = 120 km, and the distance traveled at 80 km/h for 1.5 hours is 80 * 1.5 = 120 km. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the car is 120 + 120 = 240 km.
### Answer: 240 km

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2 * (l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. So, the perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (15 + 10) = 50 cm.
### Answer: Area: 150 cm^2, Perimeter: 50 cm

###
|user| A car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours, then at 80 km/h for 1.5 hours. How far does the car travel in total?

The distance traveled at 80 km/h for 1.5 hours is 80 x 1.5 = &lt;&lt;80*1.5=120&gt;&gt;120 km. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the car is 120 + 120 = &lt;&lt;120+120=240&gt;&gt;240 km.

|user| A car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours, then at 80 km/h for 1.5 hours. How far does the car travel in total?
###|assistant| Reasoning: The distance traveled by the car is the sum of the distances traveled at each speed. The distance traveled at 60 km/h for 2 hours is 60 km/h x 2 h = &lt;&lt;60*2=120&gt;&gt;120 km. The distance traveled at 80 km/h for 1.5 hours is 80 km/h x 1.5 h = &lt;&lt;80*1.5=120&gt;&gt;120 km. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the car is 120 km + 120 km = &lt;&lt;120+120=240&gt;&gt;240 km.
### Answer: 240 km
