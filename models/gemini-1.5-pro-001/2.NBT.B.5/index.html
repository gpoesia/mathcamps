            Originally, after selling 78 of the 100 new smartphones, Apple Inc. received an additional shipment of 41 new smartphones. But what if instead, the additional shipment contained 61 new smartphones? How many new smartphones would the store have in that case?

As before, after the first day, the store had 100 - 78 = &lt;&lt;100-78=22&gt;&gt;22 new smartphones left.
With the larger shipment, they would then have a total of 22 + 61 = &lt;&lt;22+61=83&gt;&gt;83 new smartphones.
