        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator for 63 and 78 is 546.  We get this by noting that:
 * 63 = 3 * 3 * 7
 * 78 = 2 * 3 * 13
 
 So the least common denominator is 2 * 3 * 3 * 7 * 13 = 546

(74/63) + (91/78) = (74 * 8 / (63 * 8)) + (91 * 7 / (78 * 7)) = (592 / 546) + (637 / 546) = 1229 / 546

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add 471/25 and 73/89. First, we need to find a common denominator: The least common multiple of 25 and 89 is 2225. 
Then we convert our two fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 2225: 471/25 is equivalent to 42019/2225, and 73/89 is equivalent to 1825/2225
Finally, we add our two fractions: 42019/2225 + 1825/2225 = 43844/2225

94/89 = (94*25)/(89*25) = 2350/2225
1/25 = (1*89)/(25*89) = 89/2225

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we must find a common denominator for the two fractions:
- The least common multiple of 20 and 8 is 40
- $\frac{48}{20} = \frac{48\times2}{20\times2} = \frac{96}{40}$
- $\frac{49}{8} = \frac{49\times 5}{8\times 5}=\frac{245}{40}$

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common denominator for 49 and 35 is their least common multiple. 
Since 49 = 7 x 7 and 35 = 7 x 5, their least common multiple is 7 x 7 x 5 = 343. 

We can rewrite 22/49 as 22/49 * 7/7 = 154/343. 
We can rewrite 72/35 as 72/35 * 7/7 = 504/343.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common denominator for 63 and 6 is 126. So, we will convert both fractions to have a denominator of 126: 
(25/63)+(74/6) = (25*2 / 63*2) + (74*21 / 6*21) = (50/126) + (1554/126).
Now, we can add the two fractions: 50/126 + 1554/126 = 1604/126. 
Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 6: 1604/126 = (1604/6) / (126/6) = 267/21.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the sum of two fractions, they must share a common denominator. The least common denominator of 62 and 41 is their product, or 2542.
86/62 is equivalent to (86*41)/(62*41) = 3526/2542.
99/41 is equivalent to (99*62)/(41*62) = 6138/2542.
The sum of 3526/2542 and 6138/2542 is (3526+6138)/2542 = 9664/2542.
This fraction can be simplified to 38/11.

To get a denominator of 1144 for 87/88, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 13: (87 * 13) / (88 * 13) = 1131/1144. To get a denominator of 1144 for 24/13, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 88: (24 * 88) / (13 * 88) = 2112/1144. We can now add the two fractions: 1131/1144 + 2112/1144 = 3243/1144.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 75 and 47 is their product, which is 3525. 
We can rewrite 21/75 as (21*47)/(75*47) = 987/3525
Similarly, we can rewrite 44/47 as (44*75)/(47*75) = 3300/3525.
Therefore, 21/75 + 44/47 = 987/3525 + 3300/3525 = (987+3300)/3525 = 4287/3525.

            Instead of the original problem (77/5 + 4/11), consider a change such that now we are adding 77/5 and 4/79 instead. In the context of the previous word problem, if we were originally adding parts of a recipe, we could consider the change as modifying one part of the recipe. What happens if we modify the recipe in this way, by replacing the quantity we originally added with 4/79?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Replacing 4/11 with 4/79 means we are adding a much smaller quantity to 77/5.  

Think of it like this: if you were originally adding 4/11 of a cup of sugar to a recipe, and then changed it to 4/79 of a cup, you're now using a much smaller amount of sugar.  

This modification would make the overall sum smaller because the fraction 4/79 represents a smaller portion than 4/11.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 57 and 80 is 4560. 
To get a denominator of 4560 for 95/57, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 80: (95 * 80) / (57 * 80) = 7600 / 4560
To get a denominator of 4560 for 28/80, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 57: (28 * 57) / (80 * 57) = 1596 / 4560
Now we can add the two fractions: 7600/4560 + 1596/4560 = 9196/4560

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: You're asking to calculate (23/20 + 82/97) - 7/44. We already know from the previous problem that 23/20 + 82/97 = 3871/1940. 

To subtract fractions, they must also have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 1940 and 44 is 42680. Let's rewrite both fractions with that denominator:

3871/1940 = (3871 * 22)/(1940 * 22) = 85162/42680
7/44 = (7 * 970)/(44 * 970) = 6790/42680

Now we can perform the subtraction: 85162/42680 - 6790/42680 = (85162 - 6790)/42680 = 78372/42680

Finally, let's simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 872: (78372/872) / (42680/872) = 90/49

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 32 and 15 is 480.

*  (15/32) * (15/15) = 225/480
* (65/15) * (32/32) = 2080/480

Therefore, (15/32) + (65/15) = (225/480) + (2080/480) = 2305/480.

This can be simplified to 153/32, or 4 25/32 as a mixed number.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
 49/57 simplifies to 7/9, because both numerator and denominator are divisible by 7.
 89/99 simplifies to 89/99, because there is no common divisor other than 1.
 Finally, (7/9)+(89/99) = (77+89)/99 = 166/99.

 The least common denominator of 245 (5 * 7 * 7) and 72 (2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3) is 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 7 = 17640.
 
 Rewriting our fractions, we get (543 * 72)/(245 * 72) + (27 * 245)/(72 * 245) = 39096/17640 + 6615/17640

(49/37)*(30/30)= 1470/1110
Adding these fractions gives (2146+1470)/1110 = 3616/1110.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
We know from the previous question that ((33/90) + (77/79)) is 9537/7110. 

To subtract 7/89 from 9537/7110, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 7110 and 89 is 632790.

Converting to fractions with a denominator of 632790, we get (9537/7110)*(89/89) = 848793/632790 and (7/89)*(7110/7110) = 49770/632790.

Subtracting these fractions, we get (848793 - 49770)/632790.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator for 90 and 79 is their product, 7110.

Converting to fractions with a denominator of 7110, we get (33/90)*(79/79) = 2607/7110 and (98/79)*(90/90) = 8820/7110.

Adding these fractions, we get (2607 + 8820)/7110.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to put both fractions over a common denominator. The least common denominator for 66 and 2 is 66. So, we need to rewrite 59/2 with a denominator of 66.  We can do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 33: (59/2) * (33/33) = 1947/66.  Now, our problem becomes 1947/66 - 11/66. Subtracting the numerators, we have (1947-11)/66 = 1936/66. This fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 22.  This gives us (1936/22)/(66/22) = 88/3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found out from the previous problem that subtracting 11/66 from 59/2 results in 88/3. So, the problem becomes 63/51 + 88/3. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 51 and 3 is 153.  We can rewrite 63/51 as (63/51)*(3/3) = 189/153. We can rewrite 88/3 as (88/3)*(51/51) = 4488/153.  Now, the problem becomes 189/153 + 4488/153 = (189+4488)/153 = 4677/153. This fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3. This gives us (4677/3)/(153/3) = 1559/51.

We also need to rewrite 11/31 with a denominator of 62: (11/31)*(2/2) = 22/62. Our problem now becomes 649/62 - 22/62. Subtracting the numerators gives us (649-22)/62 = 627/62.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they need to share a common denominator. The least common denominator for 44 and 91 is their product, 4004.  We can rewrite 78/44 as (78*91)/(44*91) = 7098/4004, and we can rewrite 17/91 as (17*44)/(91*44) = 748/4004.  Therefore, 78/44 + 17/91 = 7098/4004 + 748/4004 = 7846/4004, which simplifies to 1961/1001.

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the sum of the first two fractions. We can add the numerators of the fractions because they share a common denominator: 43/4 + 71/4 = (43+71)/4 = 114/4
We can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2: 114/4 = 57/2

Now we need to add 57/2 to 92/79. To do this, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator is 2*79 = 158.  
We can rewrite 57/2 as a fraction with a denominator of 158: (57*79)/(2*79) = 4503/158
We can rewrite 92/79 as a fraction with a denominator of 158: (92*2)/(79*2) = 184/158

Finally, we can add the two fractions: 4503/158 + 184/158 = (4503+184)/158 = 4687/158

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they must share a common denominator. The least common denominator for 4 and 89 is their product, 356. We can rewrite both fractions with this denominator:
- 43/4 is equivalent to (43 * 89) / (4 * 89) = 3827/356
- 71/89 is equivalent to (71 * 4) / (89 * 4) = 284/356

Now we can add the fractions: 3827/356 + 284/356 = (3827 + 284) / 356 = 4111/356

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator for 74 and 27 is their least common multiple.  The prime factorizations are 74 = 2 x 37 and 27 = 3 x 3 x 3, so the least common multiple is 2 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 37 = 1998.  Rewriting each fraction with a denominator of 1998, we get 17/74 = (17 x 27)/(74 x 27) = 459/1998 and 53/27 = (53 x 74)/(27 x 74) = 3922/1998.  Therefore, 17/74 + 53/27 = 459/1998 + 3922/1998 = (459 + 3922)/1998 = 4381/1998.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to subtract 23/29 from 4381/1998. First, we find a common denominator: the least common multiple of 29 and 1998 is their product, 57942.  Rewriting the fractions with this denominator, we have 4381/1998 = (4381 x 29)/(1998 x 29) = 127249/57942 and 23/29 = (23 x 1998)/(29 x 1998) = 45954/57942.  Therefore, 4381/1998 - 23/29 = 127249/57942 - 45954/57942 = (127249 - 45954)/57942 = 81295/57942.

Rewriting each fraction with a denominator of 1998, we get 28/74 = (28 x 27)/(74 x 27) = 756/1998 and 53/27 = (53 x 74)/(27 x 74) = 3922/1998.  Therefore, 28/74 + 53/27 = 756/1998 + 3922/1998 = (756 + 3922)/1998 = 4678/1998.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know from the previous problem that the sum of 60/79 and 53/38 is 6467/3002. To add 5/11 to this sum, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 3002 and 11 is 33022. We rewrite the fractions as follows: (6467/3002) = (6467*11)/(3002*11) = 71137/33022 and (5/11) = (5*3002)/(11*3002) = 15010/33022.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">It seems like you're trying to combine parts of a pie with whole slices, which doesn't quite make sense in a real-world context. 

Think of it this way:

* **Fractions of a pie:** When you have a fraction like 75/86, it represents 75 pieces out of a pie that's been cut into 86 slices.
* **Whole slices:**  60/3 simplifies to 20, which represents 20 whole slices of pie.

You can't directly add &quot;pieces of a pie&quot; to &quot;whole slices.&quot;  

To figure out the total, you'd need to know:

* **How many pieces are in ONE whole pie**  (Is it still 86 pieces per pie?)

Let me know if you can clarify the problem!

Rewrite 38/8 as a fraction with 16 as the denominator: 38/8 is equivalent to (38*2)/(8*2) = 76/16. Therefore the problem becomes 76/16 + 4/16. When you add fractions with the same denominator, you add the numerators and keep the denominator the same, so 76/16 + 4/16 = 80/16. Lastly, simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 16: 80/16 = 5.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The sum of 38/8 and 4/16 was 5.  We need to add 32/64 to that.  First, simplify 32/64 by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 32. This gives us 1/2.  So now we need to add 5 and 1/2.  Since 5 is the same as 5/1, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 1 and 2 is 2. We can rewrite 5/1 as 10/2, so the problem becomes 10/2 + 1/2 = 11/2.

            In the previous problem, we considered the sum of the fractions 38/8 and 4/16 and then added 32/64. Now, instead of 38/8, let's consider 12/8. What would be the new sum if you added 12/8 and 4/16 together?

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, find a common denominator for 12/8 and 4/16. The least common denominator for 8 and 16 is 16. To rewrite 12/8 with a denominator of 16, multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2: (12 * 2) / (8 * 2) = 24/16. Now the problem becomes 24/16 + 4/16.  Adding the numerators and keeping the denominator the same gives us 28/16. Finally, simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4: 28/16 = 7/4.

We can rewrite 67/15 as 4 7/15 and 27/12 as 2 3/12 = 2 1/4
To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator:

From the previous problem, we know 67/15 - 27/12 = 2 13/60

We need to subtract 7/35 from that result:  2 13/60 - 7/35

First, convert the mixed number to a fraction: 2 13/60 = 133/60
* The least common multiple of 60 and 35 is 420
* 133/60 = 931/420
* 7/35 = 84/420
Therefore, the problem becomes: 931/420 - 84/420 = 847/420

* We can rewrite 27/50 as 81/150 (multiply numerator and denominator by 3)
Now we have: 670/150 - 81/150 = 589/150

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  To add fractions, they must have the same denominator. 
The least common denominator of 59 and 94 is their product, which is 5566.
Therefore, 38/59 is equivalent to (38 * 94) / (59 * 94) = 3572/5566.
And, 80/94 is equivalent to (80 * 59) / (94 * 59) = 4720/5566.
Adding these two fractions, we get (3572 + 4720) / 5566 = 8292/5566.
This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 2.
So the simplified sum is 4146/2783.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know from the previous problem that 83/40 + 6/8 = 113/40. 
First, simplify 24/64 by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 8: 24/64 = (24/8)/(64/8) = 3/8
Next, find a common denominator for 113/40 and 3/8. The least common denominator is 40. Rewrite 3/8 as a fraction with a denominator of 40: 3/8 = (3*5)/(8*5) = 15/40
Now the problem becomes 113/40 - 15/40
Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can simply subtract the numerators: (113-15)/40 = 98/40

To get a denominator of 72 in the second fraction, multiply both numerator and denominator by 9: (6*9)/(8*9) = 54/72.
Now the summation can be written as 332/72 + 54/72.
Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can simply add the numerators: (332 + 54)/72 = 386/72

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 69 and 61 is their least common multiple, which is 1407. 

We can rewrite both fractions with this denominator: 
* (37/69) * (21/21) = 777/1407
* (67/61) * (23/23) = 1541/1407

Now we can add the fractions: 777/1407 + 1541/1407 = 2318/1407

This can be simplified to 1159/703.

First, find a common denominator for 6474 and 92.  Both numbers are divisible by 2, so let's simplify: 6474/2 = 3237 and 92/2 = 46.  The least common denominator for 3237 and 46 is their product: 3237 * 46 = 148902.  

Now, rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:

- (7665/6474) * (46/46) = 352590/148902
- (71/92) * (1614/1614) = 114594/148902 

Finally, add the fractions: 352590/148902 + 114594/148902 = 467184/148902

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:  467184/2 = 233592 and 148902/2 = 74451

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: From the previous calculation, we know that (33/23) - (12/75) = 2199/1725. Now we need to add this to 24/81.

First, find a common denominator for 1725 and 81:
* The least common multiple of 1725 and 81 is 139725
* We can rewrite 2199/1725 as (2199 * 81) / (1725 * 81) = 178119 / 139725
* We can rewrite 24/81 as (24 * 1725) / (81 * 1725) = 41400 / 139725

Now, the operation becomes: (178119 / 139725) + (41400 / 139725)

Performing the addition: (178119 + 41400) / 139725 = 219519 / 139725

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know from the previous problem that the sum of 19/30 and 75/77 is 3713/2310.  To add 1/88 to this, we need a common denominator. 

The least common denominator for 2310 and 88 is their least common multiple.  Notice that 2310 is divisible by 11 (2310/11 = 210) and 88 is divisible by 11 (88/11 = 8). So, the least common multiple is (210 * 88) = 18480

Now we can add the fractions:

3713/2310 + 1/88 = (3713 * 8)/ (2310 * 8) + (1 * 210)/(88 * 210) = 29704/18480 + 210/18480 = 29914/18480

This fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

29914/18480 = (29914/2)/(18480/2) = 14957/9240

We get:

19/30 + 75/68 = (19 * 34)/(30 * 34) + (75 * 15)/(68 * 15) = 646/1020 + 1125/1020 = 1771/1020

 Notice that the only difference between A and B is in the first fraction: (80/30) instead of (55/30).

 Therefore, the new result B will be greater than the original result A by 25/30. 
 
 To find the exact value of B, we can simplify 25/30 to 5/6 and add it to A:

*  We can rewrite 71/86 as (71 * 21) / (86 * 21) = 1491 / 1806

Now we can add the fractions: 5934/1806 + 1491/1806 = 7425/1806

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1: 7425 / 1806 = 2475/602

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  From the previous problem, we know the sum of 69/21 and 71/86 is 2475/602. Now we need to add this to 86/62.

First, simplify 86/62 by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2: 86/62 = 43/31.

Next, find the least common denominator for 602 and 31, which is 18662.

* Rewrite 2475/602 as (2475 * 31) / (602 * 31) = 76725/18662
* Rewrite 43/31 as (43 * 602) / (31 * 602) = 25886 / 18662

Finally, add the fractions: 76725/18662 + 25886/18662 = 102611/18662

Next, convert each fraction to have this least common multiple as the denominator: 26/90 = 338/1170 and 50/26 = 2250/1170.
The sum of the two fractions is thus 338/1170 + 2250/1170 = 2588/1170.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already calculated the sum of 26/90 and 50/26 to be 1294/585. To subtract 92/89 from this, we need to find a common denominator for 585 (3 x 3 x 5 x 13) and 89. The least common multiple is 52065 (3 x 3 x 5 x 13 x 89).
We convert our fractions to have this denominator: 1294/585 = 1151710/52065 and 92/89 = 52065/52065.
Finally, we perform the subtraction: 1151710/52065 - 52065/52065 = 1099645/52065.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's compare the second fractions in each sum. Notice that 50/26 is greater than 1 (since the numerator is larger than the denominator), while 50/38 is less than 1. 

Therefore, the sum of 26/90 and 50/26 will be greater than the sum of 26/90 and 50/38.

To find the simplified fraction for the second sum, first find the least common multiple of the denominators 90 and 38, which is 1710. Then convert each fraction: 26/90 = 494/1710 and 50/38 = 2250/1710.

Their sum is 494/1710 + 2250/1710 = 2744/1710.

Simplifying by dividing by the greatest common divisor, 2, gives 1372/855.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Both fractions can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. 
The greatest common divisor of 80 and 98 is 2. So, 80/98 simplifies to (80/2)/(98/2) = 40/49.
The greatest common divisor of 92 and 82 is 2. So, 92/82 simplifies to (92/2)/(82/2) = 46/41.
Therefore, the sum of the two fractions is 40/49 + 46/41 = (40*41 + 46*49)/(49*41) = 3894/2009.

Now we need to add this result to 42/99.  To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 1760 and 99. The least common multiple of 1760 and 99 is 174240.

We can rewrite 2681/1760 as (2681 * 99) / (1760 * 99) = 265419 / 174240

And we can rewrite 42/99 as (42 * 1760) / (99 * 1760) = 73920 / 174240

* To add these we need a common denominator.  The least common denominator is 15:  (54*15)/15 + 31/15 = 810/15 + 31/15
* This gives us 841/15

* We know from the previous problem that 54/1 + 62/30 = 841/15.
* We need to subtract 53/41 from this result: 841/15 - 53/41 
* To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 15 and 41 is their product, 615.
* Rewriting the fractions with the common denominator: (841 * 41) / (15 * 41) - (53 * 15) / (41 * 15) = 34481/615 - 795/615
* Now we can subtract: (34481 - 795) / 615 = 33686/615

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common denominator for 29 and 7 is their product, which is 203.
To get a denominator of 203 for 85/29, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 7: (85 * 7) / (29 * 7) = 595/203
To get a denominator of 203 for 47/7, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 29: (47 * 29) / (7 * 29) = 1363/203
Finally, we add the two fractions: 595/203 + 1363/203 = 1958/203

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know from the previous problem that 85/29 + 47/7 = 1958/203. Now we need to add 81/42 to this result.

First, find a common denominator for 1958/203 and 81/42. The least common denominator for 203 and 42 is 8526.

To get a denominator of 8526 for 1958/203, multiply both numerator and denominator by 42: (1958 * 42) / (203 * 42) = 82236/8526

To get a denominator of 8526 for 81/42, multiply both numerator and denominator by 203: (81 * 203) / (42 * 203) = 16443/8526

Finally, add the two fractions: 82236/8526 + 16443/8526 = 98679/8526

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the weight of the oranges to the weight of the apples. 
First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common denominator for 64 and 7 is their product, which is 448.
To get a denominator of 448 for 85/64, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 7: (85 * 7) / (64 * 7) = 595/448
To get a denominator of 448 for 47/7, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 64: (47 * 64) / (7 * 64) = 3008/448
Finally, we add the two fractions: 595/448 + 3008/448 = 3603/448 pounds
