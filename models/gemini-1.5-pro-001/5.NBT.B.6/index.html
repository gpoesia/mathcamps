            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We will use the same approach as before. Dividing the total number of lamps produced (now 7668) by the number of operating days (37) will give us the daily production rate.
7668 lamps / 37 days = 207.24 lamps/day (approximately).
Since we can't have a fraction of a lamp, we can round to the nearest whole number.

            The slide in the amusement park is being redesigned, and its new length is 3769 inches. The waves are still placed every 56 inches. How many waves will the redesigned slide have now?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can find the number of waves by dividing the new length of the slide by the distance between each wave: 3769 inches / 56 inches/wave = 67.3 waves. Since we can't have a fraction of a wave, we round down to the nearest whole number. 
### Answer: 67 waves
