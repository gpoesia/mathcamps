        Steve started with 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days. Then he received an extra 11 dollars. John started with 18 dollars but then he spent the same amount of money as Steve had. John found 25 dollars on the street. How much money does John have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Steve spent 38/8 = &lt;&lt;38/8=4.75&gt;&gt;4.75 dollars each day for 8 days.
So, John also spent 4.75 dollars, leaving him with 18-4.75 = &lt;&lt;18-4.75=13.25&gt;&gt;13.25 dollars.
After finding more money, John has 13.25+25 = &lt;&lt;13.25+25=38.25&gt;&gt;38.25 dollars.

        You have $45 in your wallet. You find a coin on the street worth $27/30. How much money do you have in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the value of the coin to the amount of money you already have. That means we need to calculate $45 + $27/30. 
Since $27/30 is less than $1, the total amount of money you have will be a little bit more than $45, but less than $46.

        After picking up the coin worth $27/30, you find another pile of coins. This pile of coins is worth $5/36. How much money do you have in total now?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: You started with $45 and then found a coin worth $27/30, bringing your total to $45 27/30. Now, we need to add the value of the new pile of coins, $5/36, to this amount. 

Adding the fractions separately, we get 27/30 + 5/36. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 30 and 36 is 180. 

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 180, we get (27/30) * (6/6) = 162/180 and (5/36) * (5/5) = 25/180.

Adding these fractions, we get 162/180 + 25/180 = 187/180. This is equivalent to 1 7/180

Adding this to the whole dollar amount, we get $45 + $1 7/180

        Instead of finding a coin worth $27/30, you actually found a coin worth $43/30 when you went to the currency exchange. Now, how much money do you have in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First we need to figure out how much money $43/30 represents. Since 30/30 equals 1, we know that $43/30 is more than one dollar because 43 is greater than 30. 
We can rewrite $43/30 as a mixed number: $1 13/30. 
Adding that to the initial $45 we get: $45 + $1 13/30 = $46 13/30

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the loose change to John's existing bank account. This means we need to calculate 17 + 8/37.
We can express 17 as a fraction with 37 as the denominator: 629/37.
Therefore, the total amount of money John has is 629/37 + 8/37 = 637/37.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John completes 637/37 tasks, and he earns $22 per task.
Therefore, he earns a total of (637/37) * $22 = $374 from the tasks.
To find the total amount of money he has, we add his earnings to his existing money: $374 + $637/37 = $14265/37

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the loose change to John's corrected bank account balance. This means we need to calculate 7 + 8/37.
We can express 7 as a fraction with 37 as the denominator: 259/37
Therefore, the total amount of money John has is 259/37 + 8/37 = 267/37.

One day, she decided to detour and added an extra 32/24 miles to her regular bike route. How many miles in total did she travel after adding the extra traveling distance?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First find the total distance of her regular bike route: 47/50 + 31 = &lt;&lt;47/50+31=31.94&gt;&gt;31.94 miles.
Then multiply that distance by the number of days she rode her bike to find the total distance she traveled on those days: 31.94 x 28 = &lt;&lt;31.94*28=894.32&gt;&gt; 894.32 miles.
Then add the distance of her detour to find her total distance traveled after the detour: 894.32 + 32/24 = &lt;&lt;894.32+32/24=895.65&gt;&gt;895.65 miles

        John drank a special energy drink that increased his jogging speed. After the energy drink, he was able to jog 50/49 miles per hour faster. One day, he had a speed of 4/22 miles per hour without the use of the energy drink. After consuming the energy drink, at what rate would he jog if he continued for 46/30 hours?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
First, find John's increased speed: 50/49 + 4/22 = 1298/1078 miles per hour.
Let's simplify 1298/1078 by dividing by the greatest common factor of 1298 and 1078 (which is 2): 1298/2 = 649 and 1078/2 = 539, so his increased speed is 649/539 miles per hour.
To find the distance he covers in 46/30 hours, we multiply his increased speed by the time: (649/539) * (46/30) = 30054/16170 miles.
Now, let's simplify 30054/16170 by dividing by the greatest common factor of 30054 and 16170 (which is 6): 30054/6 = 5009 and 16170/6 = 2695, so the simplified distance is 5009/2695 miles.

        A truck driver starts his route with 9 gallons of gas in his tank. He stops at a station and adds to this tank another 21/36 gallons of gas. Later, he stops at another station and adds another 26/42 gallons of gas. How many gallons of gas total does the truck driver have now in his tank?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the amount of gas in the tank at the start to the amount added at each stop:  9 + 21/36 + 26/42.

First, we need to simplify our fractions. Both 21 and 36 share a common factor of 3: 21/3 = 7, and 36/3 = 12, so 21/36 simplifies to 7/12.

Both 26 and 42 share a common factor of 2: 26/2=13, and 42/2 = 21, so 26/42 simplifies to 13/21.

Now our problem is: 9 + 7/12 + 13/21. To add these numbers, we need to convert our fractions to a common denominator. The least common denominator for our fractions is 84. 

7/12 is equivalent to 49/84 (because 7 * 7 = 49, and 12 * 7 = 84).
13/21 is equivalent to 52/84 (because 13 * 4 = 52, and 21 * 4 = 84).
9 is equivalent to 756/84 (because 9 * 84 = 756). 

Now our problem is: 756/84 + 49/84 + 52/84.
This is equal to 857/84, or 10 17/84.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know from the previous problem that the truck driver has 10 17/84 gallons of gas in his tank. To find out how many miles he can drive, we need to multiply this amount by the number of miles per gallon: 10 17/84 * 35. 

First, we need to convert our fraction into a decimal. 17/84 equals 0.2023 (rounded to the nearest ten thousandth).

        In the previous problem, we calculated how much fuel the truck driver had after adding 21/36 gallons and 26/42 gallons to 9 original gallons. 

Suppose now we mistakenly thought that the second stop was dispensing fuel faster and he actually added 26/4 gallons instead of 26/42 gallons in the second stop. If he still had the original 9 gallons to start with and added the 21/36 gallons in the first stop as per the original scenario, how much fuel would the truck driver have now in his truck after making both stops?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can solve this by following a similar process as the original problem: 9 + 21/36 + 26/4. 

We already know 21/36 simplifies to 7/12. 

We can simplify 26/4 to 13/2 (because 26/2 = 13 and 4/2 = 2).

Now our problem is 9 + 7/12 + 13/2. To add these, we need to convert to a common denominator. The least common denominator for our fractions is 12.

13/2 is equivalent to 78/12 (because 13 * 6 = 78 and 2 * 6 = 12).
9 is equivalent to 108/12 (because 9 * 12 = 108).

Now our problem is 108/12 + 7/12 + 78/12.
This is equal to 193/12, or 16 1/12.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First find the total John has after mowing the lawn: 6 + 47/8.  We can write 6 as 48/8, so 48/8 + 47/8 = 95/8 dollars.
Then add the amount his dad gave him: 95/8 + 41/10. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 40. So, 95/8 is equivalent to 475/40, and 41/10 is equivalent to 164/40.
Finally, 475/40 + 164/40 = 639/40 dollars.

How far is the supermarket from his work?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how far the supermarket is from work, we need to subtract the distance the supermarket is closer to his work from the distance between John's house and work.

This means we need to calculate (17/3) - (25/41).

To subtract fractions, they need a common denominator.  The least common denominator for 3 and 41 (since they are both prime numbers) is their product: 3 * 41 = 123.

Let's convert each fraction to have the denominator 123:
* (17/3) * (41/41) = 697/123
* (25/41) * (3/3) = 75/123

Now we can subtract: (697/123) - (75/123) = 622/123

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Similar to the previous problem, we need to subtract the new distance the supermarket is closer to his work from the distance between John's house and work.

Again, John's house is (17/3) miles from work. 

We need to calculate (17/3) - (25/46).

The least common denominator for 3 and 46 is their product: 3 * 46 = 138

Convert each fraction to have the denominator 138:
* (17/3) * (46/46) = 782/138
* (25/46) * (3/3) = 75/138

        John wants to save some money to buy a video game. The game costs $40, but John already has $29. 

Every week, John is able to save 20/48 of the money he needs. 

After a certain period of time, he decides to put all his savings so far into an investment account. The account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested after a year. 

How much money will John have in his investment account after a year?

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
First find how much more money John needs to save: $40 - $29 = $11.
Then divide the amount John needs by his savings each week to find how many weeks it will take him to save enough: $11 / ($20/48) = 26.4 weeks.
Since we only care about whole weeks, we can round this up to 27 weeks because in week 27 John will have definitively saved enough money. 
We know he saves $20/48 per week so over 27 weeks, he will have saved: 27 * ($20/48) = $11.25.
We then multiply this amount by the return the investment account promises: $11.25 * (41/11) = $41.25
So, after one year, John will have $41.25 in his investment account.

        Now, let's consider a different scenario. Suppose Maria initially starts with 36/3 euros in her pocket instead of 13/3 euros. After buying the same candy bar that costs 32/15 euros, how much money would Maria have left then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we simplify 36/3, which equals 12 euros.
Then we need to bring 12 to a fraction with the same denominator as 32/15: 12 is equivalent to 180/15.
Finally, we subtract the price of the candy bar from Maria's initial amount: 180/15 - 32/15 = 148/15 euros.

        There are two containers of juice. The first one contains 23/35 gallon. The second one contains 50/41 gallon. 

After mixing the two containers of juice together, it was transferred into a bottle which can hold 28 gallons. 

How much space is left in the bottle after subtracting 11/19 gallon which was drunk by a customer?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
* **Step 1: Find the total juice after mixing.**
   - Add the fractions (23/35) + (50/41) = (943/1435) + (1750/1435) = 2693/1435 gallons.

* **Step 2: Calculate the remaining juice after the customer.**
   - Subtract the drunk amount from the total: (2693/1435) - (11/19) = (2693/1435) - (855/1435) = 1838/1435 gallons.

* **Step 3: Convert gallons to a mixed number for easier comparison.**
   - 1838/1435 gallons is equal to 1 403/1435 gallons.

* **Step 4:  Determine the remaining space in the bottle.**
   - Since the bottle holds 28 gallons and there's a bit more than 1 gallon of juice left, the remaining space is a little less than 27 gallons. 

### Answer: A little less than 27 gallons.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

        John bought a drone that can fly 3 kilometers, but when it's carrying a delivery package, it can only fly 50 / 43 kilometers less. When the drone is attached with an additional booster, it can fly an additional 47 / 15 kilometers. How far can the drone fly with the package and the additional booster attached?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
First find how many kilometers less the drone can fly with a package: 50 / 43 = &lt;&lt;50/43=1.16&gt;&gt;1.16 kilometers.
Then subtract that number from the drone's normal flying distance to find how far it can fly with a package: 3 - 1.16 = &lt;&lt;3-1.16=1.84&gt;&gt;1.84 kilometers.
Then add the additional distance the booster allows the drone to fly to find the total distance: 1.84 + 47 / 15 = &lt;&lt;1.84+47/15=4.97&gt;&gt;4.97 kilometers.

        Richard bought a bottle of wine that had 33 ounces in it. He drank 33/48 of the wine. In the morning, he drank a cup of orange juice that contained 26/30 of a liter. After a few hours, he drank a bottle of water that contained 2/36 of a liter. What is the total volume of the liquid he consumed?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
* **Wine:** Richard drank (33 ounces) * (33/48) = 22.375 ounces of wine.
* **Orange Juice:** A liter is approximately 33.814 ounces, so he drank (33.814 ounces) * (26/30) = 29.367 ounces of orange juice.
* **Water:** He drank (33.814 ounces) * (2/36) = 1.878 ounces of water.
* **Total:** In total, he drank 22.375 + 29.367 + 1.878 = 53.62 ounces of liquid.

### Answer: 53.62 ounces.

        John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days. He began noticing that his apples lasts about as long as 48 ounces of apple juice, which he happens to consume every 42 days. Calculate the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John consumes 17 pounds of apples every 8 days, meaning his apple consumption rate is 17 pounds / 8 days = 2.125 pounds/day.
He consumes 48 oz of apple juice every 42 days, meaning his apple juice consumption rate is 48 oz / 42 days = 1.143 oz/day
The ratio of John's apple to apple juice consumption rate is 2.125 pounds/day : 1.143 oz/day
To simplify the ratio, we convert pounds to ounces (1 pound = 16 oz). This makes the ratio 34 oz/day : 1.143 oz/day, which simplifies to approximately 29.75 : 1.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First find how much money Clara spent on ice cream: 25/6 = $&lt;&lt;25/6=4.17&gt;&gt;4.17.
Then subtract the price of the ice cream from her initial amount of money to find how much money she had left: $30 - $4.17 = $&lt;&lt;30-4.17=25.83&gt;&gt;25.83.
Then multiply her remaining money by 11/21 to find out how much she spent on the book: $25.83 x 11/21 = $&lt;&lt;25.83*11/21=13.48&gt;&gt;13.48

        You have 27/6 gallons of water in a tank. You then pour out 5/40 gallons of water from the tank. As you noticed the tank seems low, you add 21/26 gallons more. How many gallons of water are in the tank after all those actions?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
 Let's simplify the fractions first to make the calculations easier. 
 * 27/6 gallons simplifies to 9/2 gallons.
 * 5/40 gallons simplifies to 1/8 gallons.
 * 21/26 gallons cannot be simplified further.

Now, let's calculate the amount of water remaining after pouring out some:
 * 9/2 - 1/8 = 36/8 - 1/8 = 35/8 gallons

Finally, let's add the amount of water poured back in:
 * 35/8 + 21/26 = (35*13)/(8*13) + (21*4)/(26*4) = 455/104 + 84/104 = 539/104 gallons

Let's calculate the amount of water remaining after pouring out 5/19 gallons:
*  9/2 - 5/19 = (9*19)/(2*19) - (5*2)/(19*2) = 171/38 - 10/38 = 161/38 gallons

Finally, let's add the amount of water poured back in:
* 161/38 + 21/26 = (161*13)/(38*13) + (21*19)/(26*19) = 2093/494 + 399/494 = 2492/494 gallons. 

This can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 2: 
* 2492/494 = 1246/247 gallons

        A turtle travels at a speed of 19/6 feet per second. How far, in feet, would the turtle travel in 24 seconds if it starts 20 feet ahead from the starting point?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The turtle travels (19/6)*24 = &lt;&lt;(19/6)*24=76&gt;&gt;76 feet in 24 seconds.
Since the turtle starts 20 feet ahead, it will have traveled 76+20 = &lt;&lt;76+20=96&gt;&gt;96 feet from the starting point.

        In our earlier calculation, we were considering the distance the turtle travelled in 24 seconds. What happens if we reconsider, and instead calculate the turtle's distance covered in 33 seconds from the same starting point that was 20 feet ahead? How many feet would the turtle travel in total then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: In 33 seconds, the turtle travels (19/6)*33 = &lt;&lt;(19/6)*33=104.5&gt;&gt;104.5 feet.
Adding the 20 feet head start, the turtle would travel a total of 104.5+20 = &lt;&lt;104.5+20=124.5&gt;&gt;124.5 feet.
