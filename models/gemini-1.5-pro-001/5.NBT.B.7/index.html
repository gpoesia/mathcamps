            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 

1. **Visualize:** Imagine the giraffe's journey as two sides of a right triangle. The northward walk is one leg, the eastward walk is the other, and the distance from the starting point is the hypotenuse.

2. **Pythagorean Theorem:**  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the starting point after the first two walks: aÂ² + bÂ² = cÂ² 
   * a = 42.53 miles (north)
   * b = 28.9 miles (east)
   * c =  âˆš(42.53Â² + 28.9Â²) = âˆš(2607.0409) â‰ˆ 51.06 miles 

3. **Retracing:** The giraffe walks 60.5 miles back towards its starting point. Since this is longer than the distance from the starting point (51.06 miles), we know it passes its starting point.

4. **Final Calculation:**  Subtract the distance from the starting point (51.06 miles) from the distance retraced (60.5 miles) to find how far past the starting point the giraffe is: 60.5 miles - 51.06 miles = 9.44 miles
