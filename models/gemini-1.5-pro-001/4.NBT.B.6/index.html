The remainder represents the leftover cookies. We can find the remainder by  multiplying the number of orphanages by the number of cookies each received, and subtracting that from the total number of cookies: 928 - (186 * 4) = &lt;&lt;928-(186*4)=184&gt;&gt;184

            In the previously mentioned scenario, consider that the baker only baked 173 cookies instead of 928. He still plans on distributing equal amounts of cookies to the 186 orphanages.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the baker only has 173 cookies, and 173 is less than the number of orphanages (186), he can't even give a full set to one orphanage.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The company can fill 473/22 = &lt;&lt;473/22=21.5&gt;&gt;21.5 containers.
Since we can't have half a container, the company can fill 21 containers.
That means 21*22 = &lt;&lt;21*22=462&gt;&gt;462 gallons of juice are used to fill up the containers.
Therefore, 473-462 = &lt;&lt;473-462=11&gt;&gt;11 gallons of juice will be left.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The company can fill 599/22 = &lt;&lt;599/22=27.23&gt;&gt;27.23 containers.
Since we can't have a fraction of a container, they can fill 27 containers.
This means they used 27*22 = &lt;&lt;27*22=594&gt;&gt;594 gallons of juice to fill up all the containers. 
Therefore, they have 599-594 = &lt;&lt;599-594=5&gt;&gt;5 gallons of juice left over.

To find the remainder, multiply the number of full bags (7) by the capacity of each bag (119): 7 * 119 = 833

This means there is 1 complete cluster and 0.22 of another cluster. Since we can't have a fraction of a cluster, we focus on the whole number, which is 1.
One cluster contains 446 stars, so 544 total stars - 446 stars in the cluster = &lt;&lt;544-446=98&gt;&gt;98 stars remain ungrouped.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  First, we'll find how many full nights of viewing are needed by dividing the total members by the telescope's capacity: 759 members / 228 members/night = 3.33 nights. 
Since we can't have a fraction of a night, we know there will be 3 full nights of viewing.
Next, we need to determine how many members will be on the final, partially filled, night.  We multiply the number of full nights by the telescope's capacity:  3 nights * 228 members/night = 684 members.
Finally, subtract the number of members viewing on the full nights from the total number of members to find the number of members viewing on the final night: 759 members - 684 members = 75 members.

Multiplying the number of full nights by the telescope capacity: 2 nights * 228 members/night = 456 members.

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to determine the highest multiple of 205 that is less than or equal to 691. This represents the maximum number of packs we can fill. 205 x 3 = 615 and 205 x 4 = 820, so the highest multiple is 615, meaning we can fill 3 complete packs. 
To find the remaining bulbs, we subtract the number of bulbs used in the packs from the total number of bulbs: 691 total bulbs - 615 bulbs in packs = 76 bulbs unpacked.

The largest multiple of 205 less than 739 is 615 (3 x 205 = 615).
Subtracting this from the total number of bulbs gives us: 739 - 615 = 124.

            A windmill generates 506 units of power per day. Every day, a small village consumes power in increments of 385 units. At the end of the day, after the village has consumed as much power as it can in full increments, how much power is left over?

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find the remainder when 506 (total power) is divided by 385 (power consumed in each increment). 
This means the leftover power is 506 - 385 = &lt;&lt;506-385=121&gt;&gt;121 units.

            Following the scenario of the windmill and the small village, let's now consider that the windmill had a great day and managed to generate 506 units of power. However, due to development demands, the daily consumption of the village has increased to 920 units. At the end of the day, with the power being consumed in complete units, how much power is left over?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  The windmill only generated 506 units of power, which is less than the village's consumption of 920 units. Therefore, there wouldn't be any power left over. In fact, the village would experience a power shortage.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, find the number of full buses by dividing the total students by the bus capacity: 530 students / 144 students/bus = 3 full buses with some students leftover. 
Then, multiply the number of full buses by the bus capacity to find the number of students on the full buses: 3 buses * 144 students/bus = 432 students.
Finally, subtract the number of students on full buses from the total number of students to find the number of students on the last bus: 530 total students - 432 students = 98 students.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many full matches can be filled, we divide the total players by the number of players per match: 923 players / 383 players/match = &lt;&lt;923/383=2.41&gt;&gt; 2.41 matches.
Since we can only have whole matches, this means 2 matches will be completely filled.
Two full matches would hold 2 matches * 383 players/match = &lt;&lt;2*383=766&gt;&gt; 766 players.
Subtracting the players in filled matches from the total players gives us the number of players left waiting: 923 players - 766 players = &lt;&lt;923-766=157&gt;&gt; 157 players.

Since we can only have complete matches, only 1 match will be filled entirely.
One full match accommodates 383 players.

We can only have a whole number of swing sets, so we round down to 27 swing sets.
This means 27 swing sets * 34 kids/swing set = &lt;&lt;27*34=918&gt;&gt;918 kids can swing at once.

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
First find the average rainfall per day: 612 inches / 29 days = 21.10 inches/day (rounded to two decimal places).
The remainder when 612 is divided by 29 represents the extra inches of rain beyond what would make an even distribution: 612 % 29 = 5 inches.
To make the days evenly rainy, we would need to remove this excess rain.

To find the length of the last piece, we multiply the decimal part of the previous division by the length of each smaller piece: 0.035 * 902 meters = &lt;&lt;0.035*902=31.57&gt;&gt;31.57 meters.

            If the dairy farm increased its production and started producing 729 liters of milk each day instead of 561 liters, how many liters of milk would be left over each day after filling the 550-liter containers?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  With the increased production, we again need to find the remainder after dividing the new total milk produced (729 liters) by the container size (550 liters).
The leftover milk would be 729 - 550 = &lt;&lt;729-550=179&gt;&gt;179 liters. However, since each container holds 550 liters, we need to account for the fact that a portion of that leftover milk could fill another container.
Therefore, the actual leftover milk is 179 - 550 = &lt;&lt;-371=-371&gt;&gt;-371 liters. Since we get a negative value, this means that all the leftover milk can fit into another container, with some space remaining.  We need to find the difference between the container's capacity and this negative value to find the actual remaining space.
The actual leftover milk is 550 - 371 = &lt;&lt;550-371=179&gt;&gt;179 liters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the farmer only has 11 carrots, which is less than the capacity of a single box, he won't be able to fill any boxes. 
Therefore, all 11 carrots will be left unpacked.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We calculate the total number of batches they can make: 580 slices / 18 slices/batch = &lt;&lt;580/18=32.22&gt;&gt;32.22 batches. 
Since they can't make a fraction of a batch, they can make 32 full batches.
They use 32 batches * 18 slices/batch = &lt;&lt;32*18=576&gt;&gt; 576 slices of bread.
They will have 580 slices - 576 slices = &lt;&lt;580-576=4&gt;&gt; 4 slices left.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: With a larger group size, it's possible that all 976 tourists could fit in the first group, leaving no one for a second group. Let's check:

* Since 726 (the group size) is larger than 976 (the number of tourists), all the tourists can fit in one group. 
* This means there would be no tourists left for a last group.
