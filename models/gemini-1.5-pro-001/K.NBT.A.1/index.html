            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's use a variable to represent the unknown:

* Let 'x' be the number of letters Sean wrote yesterday.

We know:

* Sean wrote a total of 17 letters.
* This total is equal to the number he wrote yesterday (x) plus 10.

We can set up an equation: 
x + 10 = 17

To solve for x, we need to isolate it.  We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:
x + 10 - 10 = 17 - 10

This simplifies to:
x = 7

### Answer: Sean wrote 7 letters yesterday.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: After the first hour, the robot has used its initial 10 units of energy. 
To run for a second hour, it needs an additional 'w' units, and the total energy used becomes 10 + w.
Since the total energy for 2 hours is 13 units, we have the equation 10 + w = 13.
Solving for 'w', we get w = 13 - 10 = 3 units.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let 'x' be the original number of letters in James' mailbox. 
He received 7 more letters, so the total became x + 7.
We know this total is equal to 10 letters: x + 7 = 10
To find the original number (x), subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 10 - 7 = 3

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know that (e + 6) equals the total number of strings, which is 10. 
To find the value of 'e', we need to solve the equation: e + 6 = 10
Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get: e = 10 - 6 = 4
Therefore, 'e' is equal to 4, which represents the number of broken strings.
