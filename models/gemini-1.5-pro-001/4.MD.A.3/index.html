        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can calculate the perimeter as follows: 2 * length + 2 * width.
In this case, the perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * 21m + 2 * 37m = 42m + 74m = 116m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).
In this case, the length is 42m and the width is 40m. 
Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (42m + 40m) = 2 * 82m = 164m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all four sides of the rectangle. We can use the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width). Therefore the perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (24m + 20m) = 2 * 44m = 88m.
