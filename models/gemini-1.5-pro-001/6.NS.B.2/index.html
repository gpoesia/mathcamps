        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  With 10489 animals in 5130 cages, we perform the division: 10489 animals / 5130 cages = &lt;&lt;10489/5130 = 2.04&gt;&gt; 2.04 animals per cage (approximately). 

This is much lower than the previous scenario.  The more cages you have with the same number of animals, the fewer animals will be in each cage on average.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We can find the distance traveled each day by dividing the total distance (31470 feet) by the number of days (1406 days): 31470 feet / 1406 days = 22.38 feet/day (approximately).
### Answer: 22.38 feet/day (approximately)
