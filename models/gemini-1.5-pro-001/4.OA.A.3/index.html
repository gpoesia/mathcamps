            A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Penguins on the second ice floe:** 598 penguins / 26 ice floes = &lt;&lt;598/26=23&gt;&gt;23 penguins per ice floe.
2. **Increase in penguins on the first ice floe:** 35 penguins + 49 penguins = &lt;&lt;35+49=84&gt;&gt;84 penguins.
3. **Estimated total on the first ice floe:** 84 penguins + 33 penguins = &lt;&lt;84+33=117&gt;&gt;117 penguins.
4. **Adjusted total on the first ice floe:** 117 penguins - 10 penguins = &lt;&lt;117-10=107&gt;&gt;107 penguins.
5. **Penguins at base camp:** 20 adult penguins + 14 chicks = &lt;&lt;20+14=34&gt;&gt;34 penguins.
6. **Total penguins counted:** 107 penguins + 23 penguins + 34 penguins = &lt;&lt;107+23+34=164&gt;&gt;164 penguins.

            The penguin biologist made a mistake when she was adding the extra penguins for her new survey. Instead of counting 33 more penguins, she actually only counted 19 more. After realizing this, she recalculates the total penguins, still subtracting by 10, due to her initial overestimation. With the same population at her base camp (20 adults and 14 chicks), how many penguins was she now considering?

1. **Penguins on the second ice floe:** This remains unchanged at 23 penguins per ice floe.
2. **Increase in penguins on the first ice floe:** This remains at 35 penguins + 49 penguins = 84 penguins.
3. **Corrected estimated total on the first ice floe:** 84 penguins + 19 penguins = 103 penguins
4. **Adjusted total on the first ice floe:** 103 penguins - 10 penguins = 93 penguins.
5. **Penguins at base camp:** This remains at 20 penguins + 14 penguins = 34 penguins.
6. **Total penguins counted:** 93 penguins + 23 penguins + 34 penguins = 150 penguins.

            If a cloud releases 47 millimeters of rainfall per hour over a one hour period, and the average cloud typically releases 775 millimeters of rainfall over the course of 31 hours, find the amount of rainfall from the following condition. 

Subtract 22 from the average rainfall of the typical cloud per hour then multiply this by 23. Add this result to a constant cloud factor of 42. Add this new result to the hourly rainfall of the initial cloud and subtract 2 from it. What is the resultant millimeters of rainfall?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, find the average rainfall per hour of a typical cloud: 775 millimeters / 31 hours = 25 millimeters/hour.

Next, subtract 22 from the average rainfall per hour of a typical cloud: 25 millimeters/hour - 22 millimeters/hour = 3 millimeters/hour

Then, multiply the previous result by 23: 3 millimeters/hour * 23 = 69 millimeters.

Next, add the constant cloud factor of 42 to the previous result: 69 millimeters + 42 millimeters = 111 millimeters.

Now, add the result to the hourly rainfall of the initial cloud: 111 millimeters + 47 millimeters/hour = 158 millimeters.

Finally, subtract 2 from the previous result to find the resultant millimeters of rainfall: 158 millimeters - 2 millimeters = 156 millimeters.

We're keeping the same calculations from the previous problem for the average cloud:

* Average rainfall per hour of a typical cloud: 775 millimeters / 31 hours = 25 millimeters/hour.
* Subtracting 22: 25 millimeters/hour - 22 millimeters/hour = 3 millimeters/hour.
* Multiplying by 23: 3 millimeters/hour * 23 = 69 millimeters.
* Adding the constant cloud factor: 69 millimeters + 42 millimeters = 111 millimeters.

Now, instead of 47 millimeters/hour, we're using the new rainfall of 15 millimeters/hour:

* Adding the new rainfall amount: 111 millimeters + 15 millimeters/hour = 126 millimeters.
* Subtracting 2: 126 millimeters - 2 millimeters = 124 millimeters.

            At the zoo, there were 2 trips being hosted. Each trip was allowed to see 2 animals. However, each animal had 3 baby animals with them, making the number of animals seen per trip multiplied by 3. If each baby animal could be photographed 21 times, how many photos could be taken in total?

Additionally, their zorbcraft has a hidden compartment that contains 50 energy crystals and 6 extra lumino-gems, and they plan to add the upcoming energy crystals to this compartment as well. How many items (including both energy crystals and lumino-gems) would be in the zorbcraft's compartment at that time?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The zorbcraft currently has 50 energy crystals + 6 lumino-gems = &lt;&lt;50+6=56&gt;&gt;56 items in the compartment.
The extraterrestrial being will have 50 + 20 = &lt;&lt;50+20=70&gt;&gt;70 energy crystals after receiving more.
They'll then have 70 energy crystals + 6 lumino-gems = &lt;&lt;70+6=76&gt;&gt;76 items in the compartment.

            A park contains 43 Velociraptors. Then, the park added another set of dinosaurs which numbered 972, but as it so happens, each of these sections contained 27 dinosaurs. This meant the actual number of new dinosaur types added was less. After calculating the new dinosaur types, they found out that the number of Velociraptors was more. They found the difference and multiplied this difference by 7, as each of the Velociraptors laid 7 new eggs that week. How many total eggs were laid by the Velociraptors that week?

            The height of a window frame is calculated as the sum of 925 divided by 37 and 26 inches. The width of the window is 11 inches greater than the height.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to calculate the height of the window frame: 925 / 37 = 25 inches, and 25 + 26 = 51 inches.
Next, we can calculate the width of the window: 51 + 11 = 62 inches.
Now we can calculate the circumference of the window: (2 * 62) + 51 = 175 inches.
Finally, we can calculate the size of the glass required for the window: 175 - 32 = 143 inches.

            Suppose that there was an error in the original measurements. The height of the window frame is instead calculated as the sum of 925 divided by 37 and 16 inches, not 26 inches. Recalculating with these new measurements, what would be the size of the glass required for the window now?

With the corrected measurement, the height of the window frame is: 925 / 37 = 25 inches, and 25 + 16 = 41 inches.
The width of the window is then: 41 + 11 = 52 inches.
The circumference of the window would be: (2 * 52) + 41 = 145 inches.
Finally, the size of the glass required for the window would be: 145 - 32 = 113 inches.

He then decides to make a new batch of chocolate using a special recipe. This recipe calls for a total of 38 grams of cocoa, but subtraction the weight of one piece from the 176g bars, plus an additional 26 grams of sugar.

Simultaneously, the chocolatier decides to create another batch of chocolates that needs a total of 38 grams of cocoa and 18 grams of milk.

First find the weight of each piece from the 176g bar: 176 grams / 8 pieces = &lt;&lt;176/8=22&gt;&gt;22 grams/piece.
Then subtract the weight of one piece from the 176g bar: 176 grams - 22 grams = 154 grams.
Now, calculate the total weight of the second batch: 154 grams + 26 grams + 38 grams = 218 grams.
Then, calculate the total weight of the third batch: 38 grams + 18 grams = 56 grams.
Finally, find the difference in weight between the two batches: 218 grams - 56 grams = 162 grams.

            In a different scenario, suppose the jewelry maker initially had 50 beads instead of 38. She still removed a number of beads equal to 560 divided by 40. Afterwards, she realized she might have actually started with 15 more beads than she originally thought. After correcting her count and removing some beads, she added one more bead, and then 39 more beads. How many beads does the jewelry maker have now in this case?

First find the number of beads removed: 560 / 40 = &lt;&lt;560/40=14&gt;&gt;14 beads.
Then add the 15 beads she may have started with: 50 + 15 = &lt;&lt;50+15=65&gt;&gt;65 beads.
Then subtract the beads that were removed: 65 - 14 = &lt;&lt;65-14=51&gt;&gt;51 beads.
Then add the one bead: 51 + 1 = &lt;&lt;51+1=52&gt;&gt;52 beads.

After the third round you sacrificed 30 gold coins but the number of emeralds and sapphires remained unchanged because they are independent of the number of gold coins.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: They add 350 marshmallows / 7 hours = &lt;&lt;350/7=50&gt;&gt;50 marshmallows to each hour of production.

Their intended increase in production per hour is 4.17 packs + 6 packs = &lt;&lt;4.17+6=10.17&gt;&gt;10.17 packs.
However, due to limitations, their actual increase is 10.17 packs - 4.13 packs = &lt;&lt;10.17-4.13=6.04&gt;&gt;6.04 packs per hour.

In comparison, another wizard casts a spell that produces 460 glowing orbs in 20 days. What is the daily average here?

Now, let's assume that the difference in their daily averages times the second wizard's daily average is a magical constant represented by 'n'. Can you find out what 'n' is?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the first wizard's daily average**

The first wizard produces 882 lights / 21 days = &lt;&lt;882/21=42&gt;&gt; 42 lights per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the second wizard's daily average**

The second wizard produces 460 orbs / 20 days = &lt;&lt;460/20=23&gt;&gt; 23 orbs per day.

**Step 3:  Calculate the difference in daily averages**

The difference in their daily averages is 42 - 23 = &lt;&lt;42-23=19&gt;&gt; 19.

**Step 4: Calculate the magical constant 'n'**

The magical constant 'n' is the difference in their daily averages (19) times the second wizard's daily average (23), so n = 19 * 23 = &lt;&lt;19*23=437&gt;&gt; 437.

To create a limited edition candy, they take a piece of the Special Mix, add 7 uniquely crafted sweets, then combine this with one of each flavor from their 20 different flavored candies (excluding 19 of them so it's not too overwhelming).

* **Complete Special Mix:** Adding the extra goodies, the Special Mix totals 55 + 43 = 98 components.
* **Enhanced Mix:**  Adding the unique sweets brings the total to 98 + 7 = 105 components.
* **Near Final Count:** Including one of each of the other flavors means adding 20 - 19 = 1 more component, for a total of 105 + 1 = 106 components.

* **Revised Special Mix Base:** With the Jawbreaker adjusted, the Special Mix base becomes 14 (Sugar Rush) + 25 (Candy Twirl) + 23 (Jawbreaker) = 62 ingredients.
* **Revised Complete Special Mix:** Adding the extra goodies results in 62 + 43 = 105 components. 
* **The Remaining Steps:**  Notice that from this point onward, the steps to create the limited edition candy are identical to the original problem. We add the unique sweets (+7), the single extra flavor (+1), and remove the experimental sweets (-3).

* **Therefore, the change in the Jawbreaker's ingredients only affects the Special Mix base. The final count is still 105 + 7 + 1 - 3 = 110 components.

            The previous problem had us determine the total number of police officers on duty under certain conditions. Now, let's imagine a slightly different scenario.

Like the previous situation, there were still 32 officers assigned to the north district and 33 sent to the south. The number for the downtown district was also the same, at 29. However, this time around, only 21 officers from the total force were transferred elsewhere instead of the original scenario's subtraction. A week later, an additional 22 officers, fewer than the 39 from the original scenario, were brought in for a different assignment. That same day, another addition of 14 officers was made, just like with the initial series of events. 

New question: How many officers total were on duty by the end of the day in this amended scenario?

            A toothpaste factory produces 26 tubes of toothpaste every hour. On Sundays, they work for 7 hours and produce additional 8 tubes of toothpaste. So, in one Sunday, they produce ((26 * 7) + 8) tubes.

The following Monday, they continue their production by adding another 31 tubes to their Sunday's total.

In parallel, in the packaging department, they have 50 empty boxes. They use 19 of them for another department, leaving them with (50 - 19) boxes.

The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is calculated by adding the packaged boxes number with Monday's production.

On Tuesday, they produced an additional 48 tubes of toothpaste. What is the total number of produced toothpaste tubes until Tuesday, inclusive?

            Now consider instead that the star had only 38 neutrons initially, and then it gains only 4 more. This total number is then multiplied by 10, for a lower energy output. During an explosion, it still releases additional energy equivalent to 6 plus 25. Now, how much total energy does the star emit?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First find the total number of neutrons after the increase: 38 + 4 = &lt;&lt;38+4=42&gt;&gt; 42 neutrons.
Then multiply that number by 10 to find the energy output after the multiplication: 42 * 10 = &lt;&lt;42*10=420&gt;&gt; 420 energy units.
Then add 6 and 25 to find the energy released during the explosion: 6 + 25 = &lt;&lt;6+25=31&gt;&gt; 31 energy units.
Finally, sum the two amounts of energy to find the total energy emitted by the star: 420 + 31 = &lt;&lt;420+31=451&gt;&gt; 451 energy units.
### Answer: 451 energy units.

            A gardener planted 13 Sunflowers in his garden. The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed. By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on and the spots needed, then he doubled that total for no particular reason. How many did he end up with?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to break down this word problem step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Calculate the additional sunflowers needed**
   - 37 times the number of petals: 37 * 5 = 185
   - Subtract 18: 185 - 18 = 167 sunflowers

* **Step 2: Calculate the total sunflowers after subtracting 10**
   - 167 sunflowers - 10 sunflowers = 157 sunflowers

* **Step 3: Calculate the total sunflowers after adding the initial amount**
   - 157 sunflowers + 13 sunflowers = 170 sunflowers

* **Step 4: Calculate the number of spots needed for the orchids**
   - 92 orchids / 23 orchids per spot = 4 spots

* **Step 5: Calculate the total number of plants and spots**
   - 170 sunflowers + 4 spots = 174

            After all of his calculations and planting, the gardener discovered an error in his original calculations: instead of 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, it should have been 47 times the number of petals on one sunflower, minus 18.

* **Step 1: Calculate the additional sunflowers needed (corrected)**
   - 47 times the number of petals: 47 * 5 = 235
   - Subtract 18: 235 - 18 = 217 sunflowers

* **Step 2: Calculate the total sunflowers after subtracting 10**
   - 217 sunflowers - 10 sunflowers = 207 sunflowers

* **Step 3: Calculate the total sunflowers after adding the initial amount**
   - 207 sunflowers + 13 sunflowers = 220 sunflowers

* **Step 4: Calculate the number of spots needed for the orchids (unchanged)**
   - 92 orchids / 23 orchids per spot = 4 spots

* **Step 5: Calculate the total number of plants and spots**

            A treasure chest contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds. Unfortunately, 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed. The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest. 

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

What is the value (m) of the remaining treasure?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of real stones in the first chest.**

* Total stones: 23 emeralds + 30 diamonds = 53 stones
* Real stones: 53 stones - 39 fake stones = 14 stones (y = 14)

**Step 2: Calculate the value (g) of the first chest.**

* y * y - 37 = g 
* 14 * 14 - 37 = g
* 196 - 37 = g
* g = 159

**Step 3: Calculate the number of rubies (x) each pirate receives.**

* Rubies per pirate: 540 rubies / 45 pirates = 12 rubies/pirate

**Step 4:  Calculate the total number of rubies left after the division (x).**

* Total rubies left: (12 rubies/pirate * 45 pirates) - 3 rubies = 537 rubies (x = 537)

**Step 5: Calculate the new value after subtracting the remaining rubies.**

* New value: g - x = 159 - 537 = -378

**Step 6: Calculate the count (s) of pearls and zirconias left.**

* Total pearls and zirconias: 23 pearls + 11 zirconias = 34 pieces
* Remaining pieces: 34 pieces - 9 damaged pieces = 25 pieces (s = 25)

**Step 7: Calculate the final value (m) of the remaining treasure.**

* Final value (m): -378 - 25 = -403

If they corrected their mistake and subtracted 3 from 35 instead, and then multiplied by the previously calculated daily increase, what would be the corrected calculated number of sightings?

            A photographer took 34 shots at a wedding but decided to remove 19 of them because they were out of focus. The next day he took an additional 21 shots at a different event. Then, he decided to add to this collection, 23 more shots he took on a third event. Similarly, another photographer took 880 shots at a large event and decided to select every 40th shot for his collection. What is the total number of shots in their collections combined?

* The second clock ticks 279 times in 31 minutes, so it ticks at a rate of 279/31 = &lt;&lt;279/31=9&gt;&gt;9 ticks per minute.

**Step 3: Add 34 to the rate of the second clock.**

* Adding 34 to the second clock's rate gives us 9 + 34 = &lt;&lt;9+34=43&gt;&gt;43 ticks per minute.

**Step 4: Multiply the first clock's rate by 35.**

* Multiplying the first clock's rate by 35 gives us 12 * 35 = &lt;&lt;12*35=420&gt;&gt;420.

**Step 5: Subtract 41 from the result in Step 4.**

* Subtracting 41 from the result in Step 4 gives us 420 - 41 = &lt;&lt;420-41=379&gt;&gt;379.

**Step 6: Subtract the adjusted rate of the second clock from the result in Step 5.**

* Subtracting the adjusted rate of the second clock (43 ticks per minute) from the result in Step 5 gives us 379 - 43 = &lt;&lt;379-43=336&gt;&gt;336.

            In the previous question about clocks, the second clock actually ticks 279 times in just 2 minutes, not 31 minutes. Re-calculate the rate of ticks per minute for this clock and add 34 to it. As before, calculate the tick rate for the first clock, then multiply it by 35 and subtract 41. Finally, subtract this modified rate of the second clock from the manipulated rate of the first clock. What is the new result?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem with the updated information:

**Step 1: Calculate the rate of the first clock.**

* This remains unchanged from the previous problem: 504 ticks / 42 minutes = 12 ticks per minute.

**Step 2:  Calculate the NEW rate of the second clock.**

* The second clock now ticks 279 times in 2 minutes, so its rate is 279 / 2 = 139.5 ticks per minute. 

**Step 3: Add 34 to the NEW rate of the second clock.**

* Adding 34 gives us 139.5 + 34 = 173.5 ticks per minute.

**Step 4: Multiply the first clock's rate by 35.**

* 12 ticks per minute * 35 = 420

**Step 5: Subtract 41 from the result in Step 4.**

* 420 - 41 = 379

**Step 6: Subtract the adjusted rate of the second clock from the result in Step 5.**

* 379 - 173.5 = 205.5

            The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down your friend's calculations step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculating remaining squares for hours**

* They started with 37 squares for hours and completed 32, leaving 37 - 32 = 5 squares.
* Their subsequent calculations (5 + 42 - 37) don't change this result. 
* They need 5 more squares to represent the hours.

**Step 2: Adding squares for minutes and seconds**

* They want to add 25 squares for minutes and 28 for seconds. 
* This totals 25 + 28 = 53 squares.

**Step 3: Adjusting the total**

* They added 41 and 28 to the 25 squares for minutes, totaling 25 + 41 + 28 = 94.
* Then they added 17 more, resulting in 94 + 17 = 111 squares. 
* Due to material constraints, they reduced this number by 23: 111 - 23 = 88 squares.

**Step 4: Final calculation**

* They need to add the squares for hours (5) to the adjusted total (88): 88 + 5 = 93 squares.

            Suppose we revisit the scenario of the bus ride. This time, imagine that instead of 37 passengers initially on the bus, there were only 28 passengers. Then, the bus picked up 20 more passengers at the next stop, but 44 passengers get off before the next stop. The remaining passengers each pay a bus fare of $11, but the company also deducts a $14 service fee from the total fares. How much revenue does the bus company get in this situation?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
* Initially, with 28 passengers, the bus picked up 20 more, bringing the total to 28+20 = &lt;&lt;28+20=48&gt;&gt;48 passengers.
* With 44 passengers disembarking, there were 48-44 = &lt;&lt;48-44=4&gt;&gt;4 passengers left on the bus.
* These 4 passengers each paid $11, resulting in a total fare collection of 4*$11 = &lt;&lt;4*11=44&gt;&gt;$44.
* However, after the $14 service fee deduction, the bus company's final revenue was $44-$14 = &lt;&lt;44-14=30&gt;&gt;$30.

            Let's reconsider the original scenario where the reserve started with ginger giraffes. But this time assume that the reserve initially had 42 ginger giraffes instead of 16. They again brought in the same number of golden giraffes as the ginger ones. Later, they decided to add another group of 46 greyish giraffes. What would be the total number of giraffes in the reserve now under this new scenario?

            Continuing from the previous scenario, consider that the turtle realizes that it originally miscalculated the daily travel distance. Instead of swimming 11 leagues plus 10 a day, it actually swam 11 leagues plus 17 leagues a day. After multiplying that daily total by 16 for the week, and subtracting the over-calculated 41 leagues, how much did the turtle actually swim in the originally estimated week?
