            Let's consider a new scenario. Suppose initially, James only had 1 helicopter from his birthday party and was able to buy 1 more from the toy storeâ€” not 2 as in the previous situation. After receiving these new helicopters, Rebecca again gave away the same number of helicopters that James already had. How many helicopters does Rebecca have now?

Rebecca gives away the same number of helicopters that James has, which is 2, leaving her with 4-2 = &lt;&lt;4-2=2&gt;&gt;2 helicopters.
