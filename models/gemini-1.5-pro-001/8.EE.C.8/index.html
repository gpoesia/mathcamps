            Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's solve this system of equations using the elimination method. We will eliminate 'q' from the equations.

1. **Multiply Equation 1 by 4:** 
   (40 * s * 4) - (91 * q * 4) = 37 * 4
   This simplifies to: 160s - 364q = 148

2. **Multiply Equation 2 by 31:**
   (30 * s * 31) + (12 * q * 31) = 121 * 31
   This simplifies to: 930s + 372q = 3751

3. **Add the modified equations together:**
   (160s - 364q) + (930s + 372q) = 148 + 3751
   This simplifies to: 1090s = 3899

4. **Solve for 's':**
   s = 3899 / 1090
   s = 3.577

5. **Substitute the value of 's' back into either original equation to solve for 'q'. Let's use Equation 1:**
   (40 * 3.577) - (91 * q) = 37
   143.08 - (91 * q) = 37
   - (91 * q) = 37 - 143.08
   - (91 * q) = -106.08
   q = -106.08 / -91
   q = 1.166

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is s = 3.577 and q = 1.166.

Let's solve this system of equations using elimination.  Multiply the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 4:
(1) 24b + 264m = 1080
(2) 316m - 24b = 192

Add the two equations together to eliminate b:
580m = 1272

Solve for m:
m = 1272 / 580 = 2.2

Substitute the value of m back into either original equation to solve for b. Let's use the first equation:
4b + 44 * 2.2 = 180

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To solve for two unknowns, we need two equations. This system of equations can be solved using elimination.

1. **Multiply the equations to match a coefficient:**  Let's match the 'g' coefficients. 
   - Multiply the first equation by 29:  
     (42 * o - 15 * g = 28) * 29  =&gt;  1218 * o - 435 * g = 812
   - Multiply the second equation by 15: 
     (47 * o + 29 * g = 141) * 15  =&gt;  705 * o + 435 * g = 2115 

2. **Add the two new equations:** Notice the 'g' coefficients now cancel out.
    (1218 * o - 435 * g = 812) + (705 * o + 435 * g = 2115)  =&gt; 1923 * o = 2927

3. **Solve for 'o':** Divide both sides by 1923.
    o = 2927 / 1923 = 1.5221... â‰ˆ 1.52

4. **Substitute 'o' back into either original equation to solve for 'g':** Let's use the first original equation.
    42 * 1.52 - 15 * g = 28
    63.84 - 15 * g = 28
    -15 * g = -35.84
    g = -35.84 / -15 = 2.3893... â‰ˆ 2.39

1. **Multiply equations to match coefficients:**  We'll multiply the first equation by -6 and the second equation by 1 to make the 'o' coefficients cancel out:

   - First equation * -6:  (-72v + 36o) = -126
   - Second equation * 1:    (76v - 45o) = 50

2. **Add the equations together:** 
    (-72v + 36o) + (76v - 45o) = -126 + 50
    This simplifies to: 4v - 9o = -76

3. **Solve for 'v':**
    4v = 9o - 76
    v = (9o - 76) / 4

4. **Substitute 'v' into one of the original equations:** Let's use the first original equation:
    12 * ((9o - 76) / 4) - 6o = 21

5. **Simplify and solve for 'o':**
    27o - 228 - 6o = 21
    21o = 249
    o = 249 / 21
    o = 11.86 (approximately)

6. **Substitute the value of 'o' back into the equation for 'v':**
    v = (9 * 11.86 - 76) / 4
    v = (106.74 - 76) / 4

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's solve this system of equations using elimination. We can multiply the first equation by -2 and the second equation by 75 to make the coefficients of 'f' have opposite signs:

-2 * (75f + 25g) = -2 * 138  -&gt;  -150f - 50g = -276
75 * (2f + 90g) = 75 * 143   -&gt;  150f + 6750g = 10725

Now, we can add the two equations together:
(-150f - 50g) + (150f + 6750g) = -276 + 10725
This simplifies to: 6700g = 10449

Dividing both sides by 6700 gives us:
g = 10449 / 6700 = 1.56

Now that we know the value of g, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for f. Let's use the first equation:
75f + 25 * 1.56 = 138
75f + 39 = 138
75f = 99
f = 99 / 75 = 1.32

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is f = 1.32 and g = 1.56.

Let's solve this system of equations using the substitution method.

Step 1: Solve the first equation for 'y'.
194 = 4y + 14n
4y = 194 - 14n
y = (194 - 14n) / 4

Step 2: Substitute this expression for 'y' into the second equation.
7 = 65n - 79 * ((194 - 14n) / 4)

Step 3: Simplify and solve for 'n'.
7 = 65n - (15326 - 1106n) / 4
28 = 260n - 15326 + 1106n
15354 = 1366n
n = 15354 / 1366 = 11.24

Step 4: Substitute the value of 'n' back into the equation for 'y'.
y = (194 - 14 * 11.24) / 4
y = (194 - 157.36) / 4
y = 36.64 / 4 
y = 9.16

Let's solve for *l* in the first equation:
146 = 28 * g + 26 * l
146 - 28 * g = 26 * l
(146 - 28 * g) / 26 = l

Let's substitute this expression for *l* into the second equation:
6 = 41 * l - 53 * g
6 = 41 * ((146 - 28 * g) / 26) - 53 * g
6 = (5986 - 1148 * g) / 26 - 53 * g
156 = 5986 - 1148 * g - 1378 * g
156 = 5986 - 2526 * g
-5830 = -2526 * g
5830 = 2526 * g
5830 / 2526 = g
2.31 = g

Now, we'll substitute the value of g back into the equation we derived for *l*:
l = (146 - 28 * g) / 26
l = (146 - 28 * 2.31) / 26
l = (146 - 64.68) / 26
l = 81.32 / 26

To solve for *p* and *y*, we'll use the elimination method. 

First, let's multiply Equation 1 by -7 and Equation 2 by 56 to make the coefficients of *y* opposites:

1) -7 * (20p + 56y) = -7 * 90  =&gt;  -140p - 392y = -630
2) 56 * (89p + 7y) = 56 * 98  =&gt;  4984p + 392y = 5488

Now, add the two equations together:

(-140p - 392y) + (4984p + 392y) = -630 + 5488

This simplifies to:

4844p = 4858

Divide both sides by 4844 to solve for *p*:

p = 4858 / 4844 = 62/61

Now, substitute the value of *p* back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for *y*. Let's use Equation 1:

20 * (62/61) + 56y = 90

Simplify and solve for *y*:

1240/61 + 56y = 90
56y = 90 - 1240/61
56y = 4250/61

Let's solve for 'd' in the second equation:

72k - 352 + 253k = 17

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's solve this system of equations using the elimination method. 

1. **Multiply the equations to make the coefficients of one variable opposites.** 
   - Multiply the first equation by 10: 
     730h - 330d = 480
   - Multiply the second equation by 33:
     330d + 462h = 3003

2. **Add the two equations together to eliminate 'd':**
   (730h - 330d) + (330d + 462h) = 480 + 3003
   1192h = 3483

3. **Solve for 'h':**
   h = 3483 / 1192 = 2.925

4. **Substitute the value of 'h' back into either original equation to solve for 'd'. Let's use the second equation:**
   10d + 14 * 2.925 = 91
   10d + 40.95 = 91 
   10d = 50.05
   d = 5.005

Therefore, d = 5.005 and h = 2.925

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can use the elimination method to solve for *q* and *e*. 

First, we can multiply the top equation by 30 and the bottom equation by -43 to make the *q* coefficients have opposite signs:

1)  30 * (43q - 44e = 29)  ---&gt;  1290q - 1320e = 870
2) -43 * (30q + 43e = 130)  ---&gt;  -1290q - 1849e = -5590 

Adding the two equations together, we get:

-3169e = -4720

Dividing both sides by -3169, we find the value of *e*:

e = -4720 / -3169 = 1.49

Now we can substitute this value of *e* back into either original equation to solve for *q*. Let's use the first equation:

43q - 44(1.49) = 29

Simplifying:

43q - 65.56 = 29

Adding 65.56 to both sides:

43q = 94.56

Dividing both sides by 43, we find the value of *q*:

q = 94.56 / 43 = 2.2

109 - (37 * a) = (6 * r)
(109 - (37 * a))/6 = r

Now, we can substitute this value of *r* into the first equation:

1. The sum of the weights of 42 units of 'g' and 12 units of 'q' equals 169 kg.
2. The weight of 12 units of 'q' minus the weight of 50 units of 'g' results in 19 kg.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's denote the weight of one unit of grain 'g' as 'x' and the weight of one unit of grain 'q' as 'y'. We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

Equation 1: 42x + 12y = 169 
Equation 2: 12y - 50x = 19

We can solve this system of equations using either substitution or elimination. We'll use elimination here:

1. **Multiply Equation 2 by -1:** This will allow us to eliminate 'y' when we add the equations together.
   -12y + 50x = -19

2. **Add the modified Equation 2 to Equation 1:**
   (42x + 12y) + (-12y + 50x) = 169 - 19
   92x = 150

3. **Solve for 'x':**
   x = 150 / 92 
   x = 1.63 (approximately)

4. **Substitute the value of 'x' back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for 'y'.** We'll use Equation 1:
   42(1.63) + 12y = 169
   68.46 + 12y = 169
   12y = 100.54
   y = 8.38 (approximately)

Therefore, one unit of grain 'g' weighs approximately 1.63 kg, and one unit of grain 'q' weighs approximately 8.38 kg.

(62)(37s - 11v = 54)  -&gt;  2294s - 682v = 3348
(-11)(82s - 62v = 41)  -&gt;  -802s + 682v = -451

Now, we can add the two equations together, effectively eliminating 'v':

(2294s - 682v) + (-802s + 682v) = 3348 - 451

This simplifies to:

1492s = 2897

Dividing both sides by 1492, we find the value of 's':

s = 2897 / 1492 = 1.941

Now, we can substitute this value of 's' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'v'. Let's use the first equation:

37 * 1.941 - 11 * v = 54

Simplifying:

71.817 - 11v = 54

Subtracting 71.817 from both sides:

-11v = -17.817

Finally, dividing both sides by -11 gives us the value of 'v':

v = -17.817 / -11 = 1.6197

Let's solve for *z* in the second equation:
78z - 48c = 48
78z = 48 + 48c
z = (48 + 48c) / 78
z = (8 + 8c) / 13

Now let's substitute *z* in the first equation:

41c + 5 * (8 + 8c) = 151
41c + 40 + 40c = 151
81c = 111
c = 111 / 81
c = 37 / 27

Now we can find the value of z:
z = (8 + 8 * (37/27)) / 13
z = (8 + 296/27) / 13

Let's solve this system of equations using the substitution method.

1. **Solve for 'i' in the second equation:**
   7i + 76c = 148
   7i = 148 - 76c
   i = (148 - 76c) / 7

2. **Substitute this value of 'i' into the first equation:**
   60c - 91 * ((148 - 76c) / 7) = 7

3. **Simplify and solve for 'c':**
   60c - (91 * 148)/7 + (91 * 76c)/7 = 7
   420c - 1908 + 6836c = 49
   7256c = 1957
   c = 1957 / 7256
   c = 0.27

4. **Substitute the value of 'c' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'i'. Let's use the second equation:**
   7i + 76 * 0.27 = 148
   7i + 20.52 = 148
   7i = 127.48
   i = 127.48 / 7

Now, substitute this expression for *e* into equation (1):

3) Substitute: 71*v - 37*((184 - 76*v)/41) = 69

Simplify and solve for *v*:

4) Multiply both sides by 41: 2911*v - 37*(184 - 76*v) = 2829

Let's represent the given information as equations:

To solve for g and z, we can use a method called elimination.

            Alex's and Brad's baskets contained c cherries and f figs respectively. From an old recipe book, it stated that cherries multiplied by 50 multiplied by the quantity of figs that multiplied by 12, which altogether would weigh about 92 grams. Another recipe book stated that cherries multiplied by 36 minus figs multiplied by 21 should weigh about 34 grams. Can you find the quantity of cherries (c) and figs (f)? Use the following system of equations to solve:

50c + 12f = 92
36c - 21f = 34.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's solve for 'c' in the first equation:
50c = 92 - 12f
c = (92 - 12f) / 50.

Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:
36 * [(92 - 12f) / 50] - 21f = 34.

Simplify and solve for 'f':
(3312 - 432f) / 50 - 21f = 34
3312 - 432f - 1050f = 1700
-1482f = -1612
f = -1612 / -1482 = 1.09 (approximately).

Now, substitute the value of 'f' back into the equation for 'c':
c = (92 - 12 * 1.09) / 50
c = (92 - 13.08) / 50
c = 78.92 / 50 = 1.58 (approximately).

Therefore, Alex had approximately 1.58 cherries and Brad had approximately 1.09 figs.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
To solve for two unknowns, we need two equations, which we have. Let's use elimination to find the values of u and d.

1. **Multiply the equations to match coefficients:**  We'll multiply the top equation by 85 and the bottom equation by 75 to make the 'd' coefficients have opposite signs:
   - (87u - 75d = 7) * 85  -&gt;  7395u - 6375d = 595
   - (85d - 82u = 54) * 75  -&gt; -6150u + 6375d = 4050

2. **Add the equations together:**
   - (7395u - 6375d = 595) + (-6150u + 6375d = 4050) 
   - This simplifies to: 1245u = 4645

3. **Solve for 'u':**
   - Divide both sides by 1245: 
   - u = 4645 / 1245
   - u = 3.73 (approximately)

4. **Substitute 'u' back into either original equation to solve for 'd':** Let's use the first original equation:
   - 87(3.73) - 75d = 7
   - 324.51 - 75d = 7
   - -75d = -317.51
   - d = -317.51 / -75
   - d = 4.23 (approximately)

Using these equations, can you figure out the values of i and a for him?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can solve for the unknowns 'a' and 'i' using simultaneous equations. Let's represent the first equation as Equation 1: 75a - 4i = 42 and the second equation as Equation 2: 10i + 13a = 160.

To solve for 'a', let's multiply Equation 1 by 5 and Equation 2 by 2:

Equation 1 * 5: 375a - 20i = 210
Equation 2 * 2: 20i + 26a = 320

Now, add the modified equations together:

(375a - 20i) + (20i + 26a) = 210 + 320
401a = 530
a = 530 / 401
a = 1.32 (approximately)

Now, substitute the value of 'a' back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for 'i'. Let's use Equation 1:

75 * 1.32 - 4i = 42
99 - 4i = 42
-4i = 42 - 99
-4i = -57
i = -57 / -4

   - (27 * c - 18 * p = 13) * 37   -&gt;  999c - 666p = 481

2. **Add the equations:** Notice that the 'p' terms cancel out:

     2331c = 3775

3. **Solve for 'c':** Divide both sides by 2331:

To solve for y and z, we can use elimination. Multiplying the second equation by -12, we get:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
Let's rearrange the second equation to make it easier to solve for one variable:
(23*h) = 124 - (11*p)

Now, let's substitute the value of (23*h) from the rearranged second equation into the first equation:
(124 - (11*p)) - (46*p) = 58

Simplifying the equation:
124 - 11p - 46p = 58
124 - 57p = 58

Moving the constant term to the right side:
-57p = 58 - 124
-57p = -66

Solving for p:
p = -66 / -57
p = 1.16 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now that we know p = 1.16, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for h. Let's use the first equation:

(23 * h) - (46 * 1.16) = 58
23h - 53.36 = 58

Moving the constant term to the right side:
23h = 58 + 53.36
23h = 111.36

Solving for h:
h = 111.36 / 23
h = 4.84 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is h = 4.84 and p = 1.16.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To solve for the values of d and f, we can use the elimination method. 

1. **Multiply equations to match coefficients:** We can multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of 'f' have opposite signs and the same magnitude.
   - Equation 1 * 7: (19d + 6f = 120) * 7  =&gt;  133d + 42f = 840
   - Equation 2 * 3: (90d - 42f = 69) * 3 =&gt; 270d - 126f = 207

2. **Add the modified equations:** Add the two equations obtained in the previous step to eliminate 'f':
   - (133d + 42f) + (270d - 126f) = 840 + 207 
   -  403d = 1047

3. **Solve for 'd':** Divide both sides of the equation by 403 to isolate 'd':
   - 403d / 403 = 1047 / 403
   - d = 2.6

4. **Substitute 'd' into either original equation to solve for 'f':** Let's substitute 'd = 2.6' into the first original equation:
   - 19(2.6) + 6f = 120
   - 49.4 + 6f = 120

5. **Solve for 'f':** 
   - 6f = 120 - 49.4
   - 6f = 70.6
   - f = 70.6 / 6
   - f = 11.77

Therefore, the values of d and f are: 
d = 2.6 and f = 11.77

1. **Multiply equations to match coefficients:**  We'll eliminate 'r' by matching its coefficients. 
   - Multiply the first equation by 52: 
     (42 * m + 55 * r) * 52 = 127 * 52  
     2184 * m + 2860 * r = 6604 
   - Multiply the second equation by 55:
     (66 * m - 52 * r) * 55 = 44 * 55
     3630 * m - 2860 * r = 2420

2. **Add the modified equations:**
   (2184 * m + 2860 * r) + (3630 * m - 2860 * r) = 6604 + 2420
   5814 * m = 9024

3. **Solve for 'm':**
   m = 9024 / 5814
   m = 1.55

4. **Substitute 'm' into either original equation to solve for 'r':** Let's use the first equation:
   42 * 1.55 + 55 * r = 127
   65.1 + 55 * r = 127
   55 * r = 61.9

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's solve this system of equations using the elimination method.  We can multiply the top equation by 57 and the bottom equation by -31 to make the 'n' coefficients cancel out when we add the equations together:

```
(31n + 64w = 120) * 57  --&gt;  1767n + 3648w = 6840 
(57w + 71n = 173) * -31  --&gt;  -1767n - 1767w = -5363
```

Now, adding the two equations, we get:

```
1881w = 1477 
```

Dividing both sides by 1881 gives us:

```
w = 1477/1881 = 0.785 
```

Now that we know 'w', we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for 'n'. Let's use the first original equation:

```
31n + 64(0.785) = 120
```

Simplifying:

```
31n + 50.24 = 120
```

Subtracting 50.24 from both sides:

```
31n = 69.76
```

Dividing both sides by 31:

```
n = 69.76 / 31 = 2.25

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's solve this system of equations using the elimination method. We can start by simplifying the equations.
 Divide the first equation by 2: 36a + 13u = 56. 

Multiply the simplified first equation (36a + 13u = 56) by 77: 2772a + 1001u = 4312.
Multiply the second equation (76u - 77a = 31) by 36: 2736u - 2772a = 1116.

Now, add both transformed equations: 
(2772a + 1001u) + (2736u - 2772a) = 4312 + 1116.
This simplifies to: 3737u = 5428.

Therefore, u = 5428 / 3737 = 1.4525.

Substitute the value of u back into the simplified first equation: 36a + 13 * 1.4525 = 56.
This simplifies to: 36a = 37.1175.

Therefore, a = 37.1175 / 36 = 1.0311.

4. **Substitute 'n' to find 'b':** Substitute the value of 'n' (2.15) into either of the original equations to solve for 'b'. Let's use the first equation:

   - 116.1 + 18b = 143

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
Let's solve for 'z' in the second equation:
60z = 13 + 42f
z = (13 + 42f) / 60

Now, substitute this value of 'z' into the first equation:
45f + 42 * ((13 + 42f) / 60) = 101

Simplify and solve for 'f':
45f + (546 + 1764f) / 60 = 101
2700f + 546 + 1764f = 6060
4464f = 5514
f = 5514 / 4464
f = 1.235

Now, substitute the value of 'f' back into the equation for 'z':
z = (13 + 42 * 1.235) / 60
z = (13 + 51.87) / 60
z = 64.87 / 60
z = 1.081

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is f = 1.235 and z = 1.081.

Let's solve this system of equations using elimination. 

1. **Multiply equations to match coefficients:**
   - Multiply the first equation by 58:  
     (26 * p - 21 * u) * 58 = 6 * 58  =&gt; 1508p - 1218u = 348
   - Multiply the second equation by 21: 
     (15 * p + 58 * u) * 21 = 83 * 21 =&gt; 315p + 1218u = 1743

2. **Add the equations to eliminate 'u':**
   (1508p - 1218u) + (315p + 1218u) = 348 + 1743
   1823p = 2091

3. **Solve for 'p':**
   p = 2091 / 1823 
   p = 1.15

4. **Substitute 'p' back into either original equation to solve for 'u'. Let's use the first one:**
   26 * 1.15 - 21 * u = 6
   29.9 - 21u = 6

Let's solve for 'n' first. 

1. Multiply the first equation by 8: (92*n - 38*s = 62) * 8  =&gt;   736*n - 304*s = 496
2. Multiply the second equation by 38: (59*n + 8*s = 75) * 38  =&gt;   2242*n + 304*s = 2850
3. Add the modified equations together: 
    736*n - 304*s = 496
    2242*n + 304*s = 2850
    ------------------
    2978*n = 3346
4. Isolate 'n' by dividing both sides by 2978: n = 3346/2978 =&gt;  n = 1.1236

Now let's substitute the value of 'n' back into either original equation to solve for 's'.  We'll use the first equation:

1. 92 * 1.1236 - 38 * s = 62
2. Simplify: 103.5472 - 38*s = 62
3. Subtract 103.5472 from both sides: -38*s = -41.5472
4. Isolate 's' by dividing both sides by -38: s = -41.5472 / -38 =&gt; s = 1.0933

            Solving the following pairs of simultaneous equations, what would be the values for e and z? The equations are: 87 * z - 35 * e = 63 and 81 * z + 58 * e = 154.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To solve for 'e' and 'z', we can use the elimination method. First, we multiply the first equation by 81 and the second equation by -87:

(81)*(87z - 35e) = (81)*63   ---&gt;  6963z - 2835e = 5103 
(-87)*(81z + 58e) = (-87)*154  ---&gt; -6963z - 5046e = -13418

Adding the two equations eliminates 'z', allowing us to solve for 'e':

-7881e = -8315
e = -8315 / -7881 = 1.055

Substituting the value of 'e' (1.055) into either of the original equations, we can solve for 'z'. Let's use the first equation:

87z - 35(1.055) = 63
87z - 36.925 = 63
87z = 99.925
z = 99.925 / 87 = 1.149

Therefore, the solution to the simultaneous equations is e = 1.055 and z = 1.149.

Let's solve this system of equations using the elimination method. 

1. **Multiply the equations to make the coefficients of one variable opposites.**  We'll target the 'b' variable. Multiply the first equation by -18 and the second equation by 69:

   ```
   (-18) * (69b - 50o) = (-18) * 55  ---&gt;  -1242b + 900o = -990 
   (69) * (41o + 18b)  = (69) * 85   ---&gt;   2829o + 1242b = 5865 
   ```

2. **Add the two equations together.** Notice that the 'b' terms cancel out:

   ```
   (-1242b + 900o) + (2829o + 1242b) = -990 + 5865
   3729o = 4875
   ```

3. **Solve for 'o':**

   ```
   o = 4875 / 3729 
   o = 1.31 (approximately)
   ```

4. **Substitute the value of 'o' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'b'.** Let's use the first original equation:

   ```
   69b - 50(1.31) = 55
   69b - 65.5 = 55
   69b = 120.5
   b = 120.5 / 69

(33k - 41f = 31) * -10  =&gt;  -330k + 410f = -310

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for n:
n = 58l - 31

Now we can substitute this expression for 'n' into the second equation:

Combining like terms:
103 = 131l - 31

Add 31 to both sides:
134 = 131l

Divide both sides by 131 to isolate l:
l = 134 / 131

Now that we know l = 134/131, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for n. Let's use the first equation:
31 = 58 * (134/131) - n

Simplify:
31 = 7772/131 - n

Subtract 7772/131 from both sides:

    (1073y - 1036j) + (700y + 1036j) = 1443 + 3248
    1773y = 4691

3. **Solve for 'y':**
    y = 4691 / 1773
    y = 2.65

4. **Substitute 'y' back into either original equation to solve for 'j':**
    Let's use the first original equation: 29y - 28j = 39
    29(2.65) - 28j = 39
    76.85 - 28j = 39
    -28j = -37.85
    j = -37.85 / -28
    j = 1.35

Therefore, the values that satisfy the system of equations are y = 2.65 and j = 1.35.

1. (38) * [(85 * n) - (54 * t)] = (38) * 41  -&gt;  3230n - 2052t = 1558
2. (54) * [(38 * t) + (30 * n)] = (54) * 126 -&gt;  2052t + 1620n = 6804

Now, add the two equations together to eliminate 't':

(3230n - 2052t) + (2052t + 1620n) = 1558 + 6804

This simplifies to:

4850n = 8362

Divide both sides by 4850 to solve for 'n':

n = 8362 / 4850 = 1.724

Now that we have the value of 'n', substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for 't'. Let's use the first equation:

(85 * 1.724) - (54 * t) = 41

Simplify and solve for 't':

146.54 - 54t = 41

We can express the given information as a system of equations:

75u - 69q = 5
48u + 25q = 140

To solve for u and q, we can use elimination. Multiplying the top equation by 25 and the bottom equation by 69, we get:

1875u - 1725q = 125
3312u + 1725q = 9660

Adding the two equations together, we eliminate q:
5187u = 9785

Dividing both sides by 5187, we solve for u:
u = 1.886

We can substitute this value of u back into either of the original equations to solve for q. Let's use the first equation:
75(1.886) - 69q = 5

Simplifying and solving for q, we get:

141.45 - 69q = 5
-69q = -136.45
q = 1.978

To solve for two unknowns, we need two equations, which we have. Let's solve for 'v' in terms of 'x' in the first equation:

1. **Isolate 'v' in the first equation:**
   (20 * v) + (17 * x) = 149
   20v = 149 - 17x
   v = (149 - 17x) / 20

2. **Substitute this value of 'v' into the second equation:**
   (24 * x) - (49 * ((149 - 17x) / 20)) = 22

3. **Simplify and solve for 'x':**
   (24 * x) - (7251/20) + (833x/20) = 22
   (480x - 7251 + 833x)/20 = 22
   1313x - 7251 = 440
   1313x = 7691
   x = 7691 / 1313
   x = 5.86 (approximately)

4. **Substitute the value of 'x' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'v'. Let's use the first equation:**

To solve for two unknowns, we need to eliminate one unknown to solve for the other.  Let's eliminate 'o' by multiplying the first equation by 48 and the second equation by 55:

(6c + 55o = 112) * 48  =&gt;  288c + 2640o = 5376
(55c - 48o = 36) * 55   =&gt;  3025c - 2640o = 1980

Now, add the two equations together:
(288c + 2640o = 5376) + (3025c - 2640o = 1980)  =&gt;  3313c = 7356

To solve for u and w, we can use the method of elimination. 

1. **Multiply the equations by appropriate constants** so that the coefficients of one of the variables in both equations are opposites.  We can multiply the top equation by 71 and the bottom equation by -8:

   (71) * (8w + 68u) = (71) * (170) 
   (-8) * (71w - 94u) = (-8) * (8)

   This simplifies to:
   568w + 4828u = 12070
   -568w + 752u = -64

2. **Add the two equations together.** Notice that the 'w' terms cancel out:

   (568w + 4828u) + (-568w + 752u) = 12070 - 64
   5580u = 12006

3. **Solve for 'u'** by dividing both sides by 5580:

   u = 12006 / 5580
   u = 2.15

4. **Substitute the value of 'u' back into either of the original equations** to solve for 'w'. Let's use the first original equation:

   8w + 68 * 2.15 = 170
   8w + 146.2 = 170

5. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**

   8w = 23.8

Let's solve this system of equations using elimination.  Multiplying the top equation by -97 and the bottom equation by 8 gives us: 

-6596*r - 776*f = -8924 
776*f + 2944*r = 1456

Adding the two equations, we get:

-3652*r = -7468

Dividing both sides by -3652 gives us:

r = 2.045

Plugging in r = 2.045 into the first equation:

68*2.045 + 8*f = 92

Simplifying: 

139.06 + 8*f = 92

Subtracting 139.06 from both sides and then dividing both sides by 8, we get:

f = -5.8825

            Given the equations below, find the values of r and d:

For the first equation, consider 67 apples, each worth d dollars, and 37 ragdolls, each worth r dollars. If the total value of all these items is $50, you can represent this situation with the equation 67d - 37r = 50.

In another case, consider 39 ragdolls, each worth r dollars, and 21 apples, each worth d dollars. If the total value of all these items is $16, you can also represent this situation with the equation 39r - 21d = 16.

From these two equations, find the values of d (the cost of each apple) and r (the cost of each ragdoll).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
We will use elimination to solve for *d* and *r*. 

1. **Multiply the equations to match coefficients:**  We need to make either the *d* or *r* coefficients have opposite signs in the two equations. Let's target the *d* coefficient. 
   - Multiply the first equation (67d - 37r = 50) by 21.
   - Multiply the second equation (39r - 21d = 16) by 67.

   This gives us:
   - 1407d - 777r = 1050 
   - 2613r - 1407d = 1088

2. **Add the equations:** Notice that the *d* coefficients now cancel out when we add the equations:
   - (1407d - 777r) + (2613r - 1407d) = 1050 + 1088
   -  1836r = 2138

3. **Solve for r:**
   - r = 2138 / 1836
   - r = 1.165

4. **Substitute r back into either original equation to solve for d:** Let's use the first original equation (67d - 37r = 50):
   - 67d - 37(1.165) = 50
   - 67d - 43.105 = 50
   - 67d = 93.105
   - d = 1.39 

Therefore, each apple costs $1.39 and each ragdoll costs $1.165.

            To find the values of x and a, solve the following system of simultaneous linear equations: 

First equation: 163 equals 50 times x plus a
Second equation: 24 equals 98 times x minus 84 times a.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
Let's express the two equations in a standard form. 
First equation:  50x + a = 163
Second Equation: 98x - 84a = 24

We can use the elimination method to solve for x and a. To eliminate 'a', let's multiply the first equation by 84 and add it to the second equation:

```
(50x + a = 163) * 84 --&gt;  4200x + 84a = 13692
                               98x - 84a = 24
-----------------------------------------------
                             4298x       = 13716
```

Now we have an equation with just 'x'. Solving for x:
x = 13716 / 4298 = 3.2

Now that we know x = 3.2, we can substitute it into either of the original equations to solve for 'a'. Let's use the first equation:

50 * 3.2 + a = 163
160 + a = 163
a = 163 - 160 = 3

Therefore, x = 3.2 and a = 3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's solve this system of equations using the elimination method. We can start by multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of 'b' have opposite signs:

1. (67p + 18b = 110) * 2  =&gt; 134p + 36b = 220
2. (82b - 44p = 58) * 3   =&gt; 246b - 132p = 174

Now, we can add the two equations together to eliminate 'p':

(134p + 36b) + (246b - 132p) = 220 + 174

This simplifies to:

282b = 394

Now, we can solve for 'b':

b = 394 / 282 = 1.4

Now that we know 'b', we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for 'p'. Let's use the first equation:

67p + 18(1.4) = 110

Simplifying:

67p + 25.2 = 110

67p = 84.8

p = 84.8 / 67 = 1.266

* Equation 1:  63c - 36e = 27
* Equation 2: 8c + 32e = 69

Let's simplify Equation 1 by dividing both sides by 9:
* Equation 1 (simplified): 7c - 4e = 3

Now, let's manipulate the equations to eliminate one variable. We can multiply Equation 1 (simplified) by 8 and Equation 2 by -7:

* Equation 1 (simplified, multiplied by 8): 56c - 32e = 24
* Equation 2 (multiplied by -7): -56c - 224e = -483

Adding the two modified equations together, we get:

-256e = -459

Now, solve for e:

e = -459 / -256 
e = 1.8 (rounded to one decimal place)

Substitute the value of e back into either of the original equations to solve for c. Let's use Equation 2:

8c + 32 * 1.8 = 69
8c + 57.6 = 69
8c = 11.4

To solve for two unknowns, we need two equations, which we have.  There are a couple of ways to solve this.  Let's use elimination:

1. **Multiply equations to match coefficients:** We'll match the 'p' coefficients.

     (26x + 29p = 107) * 51  =&gt;  1326x + 1479p = 5457

2. **Add the equations together:**  Notice the 'p' terms cancel out:

To solve for two unknowns, we need two equations, which we have. There are a couple of ways to solve this, one being substitution, the other being elimination. For this case, we will use elimination. 

Let's multiply the first equation by 23, and the second equation by -26 so that the o terms will cancel out:

(81 * o) + (26 * n) = 163  ---&gt;  23 * [(81 * o) + (26 * n) = 163]  ---&gt;  (1863 * o) + (598 * n) = 3749
(87 * n) + (23 * o) = 143  ---&gt;  -26 * [(87 * n) + (23 * o) = 143]  ---&gt;  (-2262 * n) + (-598 * o) = -3718

Now we can add the two equations together:

     (1863 * o) + (598 * n) = 3749
+   (-598 * o) + (-2262 * n) = -3718
---------------------------------------
      (1265 * o) +         0       = 31

Solving for o, we get:
o = 31 / 1265 = 0.0245 

We can now plug this value of o back into either of the original equations to solve for n. Let's use the first equation:

(81 * 0.0245) + (26 * n) = 163
1.9845 + (26 * n) = 163
26 * n = 161.0155
n = 161.0155 / 26 = 6.193

Therefore:
o = 0.0245
n = 6.193

### Answer: o = 0.0245, n = 6.193

To solve for *w* and *s*, we can use elimination. Let's multiply the first equation by 61 and the second equation by -46:

(46 * s - 61 * w = 2) * 61 =&gt; 2806 * s - 3721 * w = 122
(61 * s + 67 * w = 178) * -46 =&gt; -2806 * s - 3082 * w = -8188

Now, let's add the two equations:

(2806 * s - 3721 * w) + (-2806 * s - 3082 * w) = 122 - 8188
-6803 * w = -8066

We can now solve for *w*:

w = -8066 / -6803 = 1.1856

Now that we know *w*, we can plug it back into either of the original equations to solve for *s*. Let's use the first equation:

46 * s - 61 * 1.1856 = 2
46 * s - 72.3276 = 2
46 * s = 74.3276
s = 74.3276 / 46 = 1.6158

Let's solve this system of equations using the elimination method. 

1. **Multiply the equations to match coefficients:**  We'll eliminate 'k' first. Multiply the first equation by -8 and the second equation by 51:

   (51) * (39i + 8k = 193) =&gt; 1989i + 408k = 9843

2. **Add the equations:**

2. **Substitute this expression for 'l' into the first equation:**

To solve for 'f' and 'h', we can use elimination method:

1. **Multiply equation 1 by -29 and equation 2 by 8 to eliminate 'f':**

   (-29) * (8f + 39h = 66)  =&gt;  -232f - 1131h = -1914
   (8)  * (29f + 46h = 119)  =&gt;   232f + 368h = 952

2. **Add the two resulting equations to eliminate 'f':**

   -232f - 1131h = -1914
    232f +  368h =   952
   -----------------------
            -763h = -962

3. **Solve for 'h':**

   h = -962 / -763 = 1.26

4. **Substitute the value of 'h' (1.26) into either original equation to solve for 'f'. Let's use equation 1:**

   8f + 39 * 1.26 = 66
   8f + 49.14 = 66
   8f = 16.86
   f = 2.11

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's solve this system of equations using elimination.  We can multiply the top equation by 69 and the bottom equation by 23 to make the b coefficients have opposite values:

```
69 * (22b + 23k) = 69 * 109 --&gt; 1518b + 1587k = 7521
23 * (62k - 69b) = 23 * 14 --&gt; 1426k - 1587b = 322 
```

Now, we can add the two equations together, eliminating 'b':

```
(1518b + 1587k) + (1426k - 1587b) = 7521 + 322
3013k = 7843
```

Dividing both sides by 3013:

```
k = 7843 / 3013 = 2.6
```

Now that we know k = 2.6, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for 'b'. Let's use the first original equation:

```
22b + 23 * 2.6 = 109
22b + 59.8 = 109
22b = 49.2
b = 49.2 / 22 = 2.2

Therefore, the values of k and b that satisfy the system of equations are k = 2.6 and b = 2.2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To solve for r and q, we can use the method of elimination.

1. **Multiply the equations by necessary multiples** such that the coefficients of one of the variables in both equations are opposites. In this case, we can multiply the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 58:

   (76) * (58r + 12q = 147)  -&gt;  4408r + 912q = 11172
   (58) * (97q - 76r = 76)   -&gt;  5626q - 4408r = 4408

2. **Add the two equations together.** Notice that the 'r' terms cancel out:

   4408r + 912q = 11172
   -4408r + 5626q = 4408
   ------------------
   6538q = 15580

3. **Solve for q:**

   q = 15580 / 6538 = 2.38 (approximately)

4. **Substitute the value of q back into either original equation** to solve for r. Let's use the first equation:

   58r + 12 * 2.38 = 147
   58r + 28.56 = 147
   58r = 118.44
   r = 118.44 / 58 = 2.04 (approximately)

Therefore, the values are approximately r = 2.04 and q = 2.38.

Let's solve this system of equations using the elimination method.  We can eliminate 'k' by multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, then adding the two resulting equations.

Equation 1 * 2: (47 * v - 3 * k) * 2 = 10 * 2  ---&gt;  94 * v - 6 * k = 20
Equation 2 * 3: (73 * v + 2 * k) * 3 = 128 * 3  ---&gt; 219 * v + 6 * k = 384

Now, add the two modified equations:
(94 * v - 6 * k) + (219 * v + 6 * k) = 20 + 384
313 * v = 404

Solving for 'v':
v = 404 / 313 
v = 1.29

Substitute the value of 'v' (1.29) into either of the original equations to solve for 'k'. Let's use the first original equation:

47 * 1.29 - 3 * k = 10
60.63 - 3 * k = 10
-3 * k = 10 - 60.63
-3 * k = -50.63
k = -50.63 / -3
k = 16.88

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is v = 1.29 and k = 16.88

Let's represent the given information as equations:

Equation 1:  89p - 41q = 60
Equation 2:  27p + 91q = 124

We can solve for 'p' and 'q' using elimination:

1. **Multiply Equation 1 by 91 and Equation 2 by 41** to make the coefficients of 'q' have opposite signs:
   - Equation 1 * 91:  8099p - 3731q = 5460
   - Equation 2 * 41:  1107p + 3731q = 5084

2. **Add the two modified equations** to eliminate 'q':
   - (8099p - 3731q) + (1107p + 3731q) = 5460 + 5084
   - 9206p = 10544

3. **Solve for 'p':**
   - p = 10544 / 9206 
   - p = 1.145

4. **Substitute the value of 'p' (1.145) into either of the original equations** to solve for 'q'. Let's use Equation 1:
   - 89(1.145) - 41q = 60
   - 101.905 - 41q = 60
   - -41q = -41.905
   - q = -41.905 / -41
   - q = 1.022

Therefore, the values of p and q are approximately 1.145 and 1.022, respectively.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We can use elimination to solve for one of the variables.  Multiply the second equation by -8/3 so that the 'd' coefficients cancel out when we add the two equations. 

-(8/3)*(27*u + 36*d) = (71)*(-8/3)
This simplifies to:
-72*u - 96*d = -568/3

Now we have the following two equations:
1) 88*u - 96*d = 12
2) -72*u - 96*d = -568/3

Add the two equations together. Note that the 'd' terms cancel out:
16*u = -532/3

Solve for u:
u = (-532/3) / 16
u = -33.25 / 16
u = -2.078125

Now, substitute this value of u back into either of the original equations to solve for d. Let's use the first equation:

(88 * -2.078125) - (96 * d) = 12
-183.075 - 96*d = 12
-96*d = 195.075

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To solve for f and n, we can use the method of elimination.
Let's multiply the second equation by -9 to make the coefficients of 'f' in both equations cancel out:
-9 * (3n - 2f) = -9 * 70 
Simplifying the equation:
-27n + 18f = -630
Now we have two equations:
1) 20n - 18f = 9
2) -27n + 18f = -630
Adding the two equations, we get:
-7n = -621
Solving for n:
n = -621 / -7 = 88.71
Now, substitute the value of n back into either of the original equations to solve for 'f'.
Let's use the first equation: 20n - 18f = 9
20 * 88.71 - 18f = 9
1774.2 - 18f = 9
-18f = 9 - 1774.2
-18f = -1765.2
f = -1765.2 / -18 = 97.51
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is f = 97.51 and n = 88.71.

   (22j + 37l = 76) * -97 =&gt;  -2134j - 3589l = -7372

2. **Add the equations:** Now, add the two equations together. Notice that the 'j' terms cancel out:

   l = -4446 / -3435 = 1.3

4. **Substitute 'l' to find 'j':** Substitute the value of 'l' (1.3) back into either of the original equations to solve for 'j'. Let's use the first equation:

To solve for one variable, we can manipulate one of the equations to express one variable in terms of the other, and then substitute it into the second equation. Let's solve for *u* in the first equation:
74u + 11w = 116
74u = 116 - 11w
u = (116 - 11w) / 74 

Now, we can substitute this expression for *u* into the second equation:
66 * ((116 - 11w) / 74) - 68w = 21
(7656 - 726w) / 74 - 68w = 21
7656 - 726w - 5032w = 1554
6102 = 5758w
w = 6102 / 5758 = 1.06

Now we can substitute the value of *w* back into either of the original equations to solve for *u*. Let's use the first equation:

1. **Multiply the equations to match coefficients:** We'll multiply the top equation by 63 and the bottom equation by 32 to make the 'e' coefficients have opposite signs:
   - (68u + 32e = 174) * 63  =&gt;  4284u + 2016e = 10962 
   - (63e - 69u = 1) * 32  =&gt;   2016e - 2208u = 32

2. **Add the equations together:**
   (4284u + 2016e = 10962) + (2016e - 2208u = 32)  =&gt;  2076u = 10994

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's solve this system of equations using elimination. First, we can multiply the top equation by 24 and the bottom equation by -57 to make the coefficients of 'p' have opposite signs:

```
24 * (57p + 4n = 129)  ---&gt;  1368p + 96n = 3096
-57 * (24p + 39n = 154)  ---&gt; -1368p - 2223n = -8778 
```

Now, we can add the two equations together:

```
1368p + 96n = 3096
-1368p - 2223n = -8778
----------------------
-2127n = -5682
```

Dividing both sides by -2127, we get:

```
n = -5682 / -2127 = 2.67
```

Now that we know the value of 'n', we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to solve for 'p'. Let's use the first equation:

```
57p + 4(2.67) = 129
57p + 10.68 = 129
57p = 118.32
p = 118.32 / 57 = 2.08

Let's solve this system of equations using elimination:

1. **Simplify the equations:** Divide the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 2:
   - 33z - 22y = 16
   - 30y + 7z = 58

2. **Multiply to match coefficients:** Multiply the first equation by -15 and the second equation by 11 to make the 'z' coefficients cancel out:
   - 495z + 330y = -240 
   - 330y + 77z = 638

3. **Add the equations:**

4. **Solve for z:** Divide both sides by -418:
    z = -398 / 418 = -199/209

5. **Substitute to find y:** Substitute the value of z back into any of the original equations. Let's use the first original equation: 
   66 * (-199/209) - 44y = 32
   -13034/209 - 44y = 32
   -44y = 32 + 13034/209

1. **Solve for 't' in the second equation:**
   69h + 11t = 124
   11t = 124 - 69h
   t = (124 - 69h) / 11

2. **Substitute the value of 't' in the first equation:**

3. **Simplify and solve for 'h':**

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
To solve for two variables, we need to form two equations with one variable and solve them. 
Let's multiply the second equation by 61/12:
 ((16*61/12 * h) - (12* 61/12 * o)) = (9 * 61/12) which simplifies to (81.33 * h) - (61 * o) = 45.75
Let's subtract the modified second equation from the first equation:
((79 * h) - (61 * o)) - ((81.33 * h) - (61 * o)) = 9 - 45.75
This simplifies to -2.33*h = -36.75
Solving for h, we get h = -36.75/-2.33 = 15.77
Substituting the value of h back into the original second equation to solve for o:
(16 * 15.77) - (12 * o) = 9
This simplifies to 252.32 - (12 * o) = 9
Further simplification leads to 12 * o = 243.32
Solving for o, we get o = 243.32/12 = 20.28
Therefore, the solutions to the system of equations are h = 15.77 and o = 20.28.

(4y + 56s = 139) * 15 --&gt; 60y + 840s = 2085
(65y - 90s = 16) * -8 --&gt; -520y + 720s = -128

Adding the modified equations:
(60y + 840s = 2085) + (-520y + 720s = -128) --&gt; -460y + 1560s = 1957

Now we have: 
-460y + 1560s = 1957

Let's solve this equation for 'y':
-460y = -1560s + 1957
y = (1560s - 1957) / 460
y = 3.4s - 4.25

Substitute this value of 'y' into any of the original equations to solve for 's'. Let's use the first original equation:

4(3.4s - 4.25) + 56s = 139
13.6s - 17 + 56s = 139
69.6s = 156
s = 2.24

Now, substitute the value of 's' back into the equation for 'y':

y = 3.4 * 2.24 - 4.25

Let's call the first equation Equation 1 and the second equation Equation 2.

**Step 1: Eliminate 'z'**

*   Multiply Equation 1 by 45:  (42d - 4z) * 45 = 75 * 45  =&gt;  1890d - 180z = 3375
*   Multiply Equation 2 by 4: (40d + 45z) * 4 = 162 * 4 =&gt; 160d + 180z = 648

**Step 2: Add the modified equations**

(1890d - 180z) + (160d + 180z) = 3375 + 648
2050d = 4023

**Step 3: Solve for 'd'**
d = 4023 / 2050 
d = 1.962

Let's use Equation 1:
42 * 1.962 - 4z = 75
82.404 - 4z = 75
-4z = 75 - 82.404

Let's solve this system of equations using elimination. First, we can simplify both equations: 
Equation 1: 21o + 12a = 71 (divide both sides by 2)
Equation 2: 21a + 3o = 37.5 (divide both sides by 2)

Now, multiply Equation 2 by -4 to make the 'o' coefficients cancel each other out:
Equation 2 (modified): -84a - 12o = -150

Add the modified Equation 2 to Equation 1:
21o + 12a = 71
-84a - 12o = -150
------------------
-63a = -79

Solving for 'a':
a = -79 / -63 = 1.25

Substitute the value of 'a' (1.25) back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for 'o'. Let's use Equation 1:
21o + 12(1.25) = 71
21o + 15 = 71
21o = 56
o = 56 / 21 = 2.67

(23 * d) - (52 * 1.315) = 7
23 * d - 68.38 = 7
23 * d = 75.38
d = 75.38 / 23
d = 3.28

### Answer: d = 3.28, w = 1.315

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's solve this system of equations using elimination. 

1. **Multiply the equations to match coefficients of one variable:**  We'll aim to eliminate 'n'. 
   - Multiply the first equation by 47: 
     (47 * 71 * z) + (47 * 60 * n) = 47 * 184  
     This simplifies to: 3317z + 2820n = 8648
   - Multiply the second equation by 60:
     (60 * 52 * z) - (60 * 47 * n) = 60 * 19
     This simplifies to: 3120z - 2820n = 1140

2. **Add the modified equations to eliminate 'n':**
    (3317z + 2820n) + (3120z - 2820n) = 8648 + 1140
    This simplifies to: 6437z = 9788

3. **Solve for 'z':**
    z = 9788 / 6437
    z = 1.52

4. **Substitute the value of 'z' back into either original equation to solve for 'n'.** Let's use the first equation:
    (71 * 1.52) + (60 * n) = 184
    107.92 + 60n = 184
    60n = 76.08
    n = 76.08 / 60
    n = 1.27

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is z = 1.52 and n = 1.27.

### Answer: z = 1.52, n = 1.27

            Given the following system of equations, find the values of e and z:

70 * e + 90 * z = 189 
99 * z - 84 * e = 20

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's solve for *z* in the first equation. 
Subtracting 70*e from both sides, we get: 90*z = 189 - 70*e
Dividing both sides by 90, we get: z = (189-70*e)/90
Now, let's substitute this value of *z* into the second equation: 99 * ((189-70*e)/90) - 84*e = 20
Simplifying, we get: 207.9 - 77*e - 84*e = 20
Combining like terms: -161*e = -187.9
Dividing both sides by -161, we get the value of e: e = 1.167
Now, we can substitute this value of e back into either of the original equations to solve for z. Let's use the first equation: 70 * 1.167 + 90 * z = 189
Simplifying: 81.69 + 90*z = 189
Subtracting 81.69 from both sides: 90*z = 107.31
Dividing both sides by 90, we get the value of z: z = 1.192

1. **Multiply equations to match coefficients:**  We'll eliminate 'o' by multiplying equation 1 by -11 and equation 2 by 26:

   (-11) * (26o - 44f = 95)  -&gt;  -286o + 484f = -1045
   (26) * (87f + 11o = 169)  -&gt;  2262f + 286o = 4394

2. **Add the equations together:**

   (-286o + 484f = -1045)

Let's solve this system of equations using the elimination method. We'll eliminate 'z' first:

1. **Multiply equations to match 'z' coefficients:** 
   Multiply the first equation by 3: (40z - 20p = 51) * 3  =&gt;  120z - 60p = 153
   Multiply the second equation by -20: (6z + 58p = 165) * -20  =&gt;  -120z - 1160p = -3300

2. **Add the modified equations to eliminate 'z':**
   (120z - 60p) + (-120z - 1160p) = 153 - 3300
   This simplifies to -1220p = -3147

3. **Solve for 'p':**
   p = -3147 / -1220 = 2.58

4. **Substitute 'p' back into either original equation to solve for 'z':**
   Let's use the first equation: 40z - 20 * 2.58 = 51
   Simplify: 40z - 51.6 = 51
   Add 51.6 to both sides: 40z = 102.6
   Solve for 'z': z = 102.6 / 40 = 2.565

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is z = 2.565 and p = 2.58.

1. **Multiply the second equation by -29 to make the *f* coefficients have opposite signs:**

  (-29) * (3 * *f*) + (-29) * (10 * *s*) = (-29) * 93 
  -87*f - 290*s = -2797

2. **Now we have the following system of equations:**

  71*s - 89*f = 5
  -290*s - 87*f = -2797

3. **Add the two equations together to eliminate *f*:**

  (71*s - 290*s) + (-89*f - 87*f) = 5 - 2797
