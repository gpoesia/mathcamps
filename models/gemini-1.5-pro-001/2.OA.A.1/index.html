            There are originally 97 dinosaurs in a natural history museum's exhibit. However, the curator decides to add 'k' more of these prehistoric creatures to the exhibit. The total number of dinosaurs in the exhibit now reaches 98. Can you find out how many new dinosaurs the curator added?

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many dinosaurs the curator added (represented by 'k'), we need to figure out the difference between the original number of dinosaurs and the new total. 

This can be represented by the equation: 97 + k = 98

To isolate 'k', we subtract 97 from both sides of the equation: 97 + k - 97 = 98 - 97

This simplifies to k = 1

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let 'x' be the total number of dolls Lily has. After donating 5, she has x - 5 dolls left. We know this amount is equal to 52. So, we have the equation x - 5 = 52. To solve for x, we add 5 to both sides of the equation: x - 5 + 5 = 52 + 5. This simplifies to x = 57.

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since 24 animals were removed from the initial number, *s*, and 75 remained, we can set up the equation: s - 24 = 75. 
To find *s*, the initial number of animals, we add 24 to both sides of the equation: s - 24 + 24 = 75 + 24, giving us s = 75 + 24.
Therefore, s = 99.
