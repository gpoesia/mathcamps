        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know from the previous problem that (25/4)/(16/6) = 75/32.  To multiply this result by 19/6, we perform the following calculation: (75/32)*(19/6) = (75*19)/(32*6). Before multiplying, we can simplify by canceling common factors: 75 shares a common factor of 3 with 6, and 32 shares a common factor of 2 with 6.  Simplifying gives us (25*19)/(16*2) = 475/32.

Calculating the final result: (5*5)/(9*2) = 25/18.

We found that (5/27)*(15/2) = 25/18.
Now, we need to square that result: (25/18)*(25/18) = (25*25)/(18*18).
There are no common factors to simplify, so we calculate the result directly: (25*25)/(18*18) = 625/324.

Let's break down the calculation step-by-step:

1. Simplify within the multiplication: (10/25) can be simplified to 2/5, and (20/4) simplifies to 5/1.
2. This gives us: (2/5) * (5/1)
3. Multiply the numerators and the denominators: (2 * 5) / (5 * 1) = 10/5
4. Simplify the fraction: 10/5 = 2

Comparing this to the previous result of 12/5, we see that changing the '12' to a '10' in the original problem results in a simpler answer and a whole number.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the inverse of that fraction. Therefore: 
(28/16) / (27/24) = (28/16) * (24/27)

Now we can simplify by canceling common factors:
(28/16) * (24/27) = (7/4) * (8/9)

Finally, multiply the numerators and denominators:
(7/4) * (8/9) = (7*8)/(4*9) = 56/36

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators. So, (9/3) * (27/28) = (9*27) / (3*28). 
We can simplify this by recognizing that 9 is a factor of both 9 and 27, and 3 is a factor of both 3 and 27. Simplifying gives us: (9*27)/(3*28) = (1*9)/(1*28/3). 
This further simplifies to 9/(28/3).
Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of that fraction:  9/(28/3) = 9 * (3/28)

We can simplify further by cancelling the common factor of 3: (3 * 3 / 7) * (5 / 3 * 2) = (3 / 7) * (5 / 2)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's simplify each fraction before multiplying:
(9/7) remains as it is.
(25/21) can be simplified as 5*5 / 3*7

Now our multiplication is: (9/7) * (5*5 / 3*7) 
We can simplify by cancelling the common factor of 7: (9 / 7) * (5 * 5 / 3 * 7) = (9/1) * (5*5 / 3*7) = (9/1) * (25/21)
Now, multiply the numerators and the denominators: (9 * 25) / (1 * 21) = 225 / 21

Finally, simplify the resulting fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:  (225/3) / (21/3) = 75/7

First, we perform the divisions: 30/7 and 16/19. Note that these fractions don't simplify to whole numbers, so we'll keep them as fractions.
Next, we multiply the two fractions. Remember that to multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (top numbers) and the denominators (bottom numbers). 
Finally, we simplify the resulting fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator and dividing both by it.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the inverse of that fraction. Therefore:
 
 (28 / 1) / (30 / 27) = (28 / 1) * (27 / 30)
 
 We can then simplify by canceling common factors:
 
 (28 / 1) * (27 / 30) = (2 * 14 / 1) * (3 * 9 / 3 * 10) = (14 / 1) * (9 / 10)
 
 Multiplying the numerators and denominators gives us:
 
 (14 / 1) * (9 / 10) = 126 / 10
 
 Simplifying the fraction, we get:
 
 126 / 10 = 63 / 5

1. We know from the previous problem that c = 4. 
2. Substitute c with 4 in the formula: ((21 divided by 9) multiplied by 4).
3. Calculate the division within the parentheses: 21 divided by 9, which simplifies to the fraction 7/3.
4. Now we have: (7/3) multiplied by 4.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know from the previous problem that ((21 / 16) / (27 / 23)) is equal to 161/144.
 
 To square this fraction, we need to multiply it by itself:
 
 (161/144)^2 = (161/144) * (161/144) 
 
 This results in:
 
 (161 * 161) / (144 * 144) = 25921 / 20736

 6 / (27/23) 
 
 Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal:
 
 6 * (23/27) = (6*23)/27
 
 Now, we can simplify by canceling common factors:
 
 (6*23)/27 = (2*3*23)/(3*9) = (2*23)/9

Let's calculate the new expression: (13 / 3) * (7 / 25). 
Unlike the previous problem, (13 / 3) does not simplify to a whole number. So, we multiply the numerators and the denominators directly: (13 * 7) / (3 * 25) = 91 / 75.

This fraction cannot be simplified further as there are no common divisors for 91 and 75 other than 1. 

Comparing to the previous result of 7/5, we see that changing (15/3) to (13/3) leads to a different final result and doesn't allow for simplification into a whole number in the intermediary steps. This highlights how even small changes in the numbers can significantly impact the outcome of calculations.

            Following the previous problem, consider that you got an answer x from calculating (20 / 10) * (10 / 1). Now, evaluate z by multiplying your previous answer x with the fraction (19 / 15). Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know from the previous problem that x = 20.  So, we need to calculate 20 * (19/15).
This can be simplified by first calculating 20 * 19 = 380, and then dividing by 15: 380/15.
Both 380 and 15 are divisible by 5, so we can simplify the fraction: (380/5)/(15/5) = 76/3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its inverse. Therefore: 
 (7/2) / (25/10) = (7/2) * (10/25)

We can simplify before multiplying:
 (7/2) * (10/25) = (7/1) * (2/5)

Now we multiply the numerators and the denominators:
 (7/1) * (2/5) = 14/5

Before calculating this, notice that 144 is divisible by 4: 144/4 = 36.  Therefore, we can simplify our calculation to 145*27/(36*4) = (145*27)/144 = 3915/144.  Finally, we see that both 3915 and 144 are divisible by 3: 3915/3 = 1305 and 144/3 = 48. So, the simplified fraction is 1305/48.

Next we can simplify (25/10) by dividing the numerator and denominator by 5: (25/10) = (25/5)/(10/5) = 5/2. 
Then, we can multiply the simplified fractions: (6/5)*(5/2) = (6*5)/(5*2).

If the initial fraction, 75/32, represented dividing something like cookies amongst a group, multiplying by 29/23 could signify that the initial share, represented by 75/32, is further divided or multiplied by a factor of 29/23. This could mean, for instance, that each person originally slated to receive a portion of the 75/32 share now receives 29/23 of that original portion.

            After solving the previous problem, now evaluate the new expression ((25 / 8) * (29 / 4)). This means we have changed the second fraction from (3 / 4) to (29 / 4).

Under the previous scenario where the fractions referred to sharing or dividing amongst a group, consider what would happen if the proportions you multiplied with were changed to this new ratio. 

Write the result of ((25 / 8) * (29 / 4)) as a simplified fraction and reflect on the impact of this change in the real-world scenario.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Multiplying the numerators, we get 25 * 29 = 725. Multiplying the denominators, we have 8 * 4 = 32. So the resulting fraction is 725/32.

In the context of our scenario of dividing items among people, increasing the second fraction from 3/4 to 29/4 significantly impacts the outcome.  Instead of having 75 units to divide, we now have 725 units. This could mean, for example, that instead of sharing 75 cookies amongst 32 people, we're now dealing with 725 cookies amongst the same number of people. This dramatically changes the portion each person receives, highlighting how even small adjustments to proportions can have substantial effects in real-world distributions.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its inverse. Therefore:
(29 / 10) / (18 / 16) = (29 / 10) * (16 / 18)
We can simplify by canceling common factors: (29 / 5) * (8 / 9)
Multiplying the numerators and denominators: (29 * 8) / (5 * 9) = 232 / 45

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators. So, (15/12) * (27/3) = (15 * 27) / (12 * 3)
This simplifies to 405/36. 
Both 405 and 36 are divisible by 9, simplifying the fraction to 45/4.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Jeremy's previous result was 45/4.  He now needs to multiply this by 22/14:  (45/4) * (22/14). 
This becomes (45 * 22) / (4 * 14) = 990/56.
We can simplify this by recognizing both the numerator and denominator are divisible by 2. This gives us 495/28.
Both 495 and 28 are divisible by 7, giving us a final simplified fraction of 70/4.
