    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: This is a trick question! You cannot add oranges and apples together to get a single total amount of fruit because they are different types of fruit. You can, however, determine the total number of fruits. 

Add the number of oranges and apples to find the total number of fruits: 20 + 15.7 = 35.7

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Adding the hundredths digits: 3 + 0 = 3
Adding the tenths digits: 9 + 2 = 11, carry-over the 1 
Adding the ones digits: 1(carry-over) + 3 + 1 = 5
Adding the tens digits: 8 + 1 = 9

Therefore, 83.93 + 13.2 = 97.13

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know from the previous problem that 83.93 + 13.2 = 97.13.  Now we subtract 60.07 from that sum.

Subtracting the hundredths digits: 3 - 7 requires borrowing, so we borrow 1 from the tenths place (making it 0) and add 10 to the hundredths place (making it 13). 13-7 = 6
Subtracting the tenths digits: 0 - 0 = 0
Subtracting the ones digits: 7 - 0 = 7
Subtracting the tens digits: 9 - 6 = 3

Therefore, 97.13 - 60.07 = 37.06

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Align the numbers by their decimal places, adding a .0 to 53:

53.0

Adding the tenths digits: 0 + 2 = 2
Adding the ones digits: 3 + 3 = 6
Adding the tens digits: 5 + 1 = 6

        If instead of 35.512, you had 42, how would the sum change when you add it to 49.926?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

Since we are adding a larger number (42) instead of 35.512, the sum will increase. 
The original sum was 85.438, so the new sum is 85.438 + 6.488 = &lt;&lt;85.438+6.488=91.926&gt;&gt; 91.926

        Follow-up question:

Previously, we subtracted 67.145 from 69.872, which was part of the original problem. Now, instead of subtracting from 77.32 like before, imagine there were actually 85 oranges to begin with.

Subtract the result you obtained in the first step from these 85 oranges. What is the new result?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Previously, we found that 69.872 - 67.145 = 2.727

        After finding the difference between 86.348 and 62.79, what would you get if you added that difference to itself?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: As we found before, 86.348 - 62.79 = 23.558.  Adding this difference to itself, we get 23.558 + 23.558 = 47.116
### Answer: 47.116

        If instead of 62.79, there were only 48 originally, what would be the new difference now when it is subtracted from 86.348?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The new difference is found by subtracting 48 from 86.348: 86.348 - 48 = 38.348
### Answer: 38.348
