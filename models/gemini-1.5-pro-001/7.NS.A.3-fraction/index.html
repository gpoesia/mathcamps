            Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, Carla expected to grow (22/3)*(22/19) = (22*22)/(3*19) = 484/57 cucumbers per plant. 
After adjusting her production, she expects to grow (484/57)*(23/17) = (484*23)/(57*17) = 11132/969 cucumbers per plant.
We can simplify 11132/969 to 1236/107

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
First find how many kg of grapes Pierre had left after eating some: 19/4 kg - 7/25 kg = (19*25 - 7*4)/(4*25) kg = (475-28)/100 kg = 447/100 kg
Then add the amount his mother gave him to find the total amount he has: 447/100 kg + 30/9 kg = (447*9 + 30*100)/(100*9) kg = (4023+3000)/900 kg = 7023/900 kg
Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 9: 7023/900 kg = (7023/9)/(900/9) kg = 780.33/100 kg = 7.8033 kg

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  First, find a common denominator for the fractions: 22, 29, and 3. The least common multiple is their product, 1914.
Next, rewrite each fraction with the common denominator: 
* Wall repairs: (26/22) * (87/87) = 2262/1914
* Moat renovations: (4/29) * (66/66) = 264/1914
* Catapults: (11/3) * (638/638) = 7018/1914

Now, add the fractions together: (2262/1914) + (264/1914) + (7018/1914) = 9544/1914

Finally, simplify the fraction: 9544/1914 = 44/9

            A giraffe at the local zoo has a peculiar eating habit. When it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves, it eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day. If the zoo calculates the weekly feeding amount by multiplying the daily intake by itself (making the result &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;) and then multiplying that with the regular daily intake, how many pounds of acacia leaves should they prepare for the giraffe for a week? Calculate ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26))^2 * ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26)) and provide your answer.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to calculate how much the giraffe eats when it's fed 25/19 lbs, which is (25/19)*(30/26) = 750/494 lbs.
Then we square this amount: (750/494)^2 = 562500/244036 lbs.
Finally, we multiply the squared amount by the regular daily intake to find the weekly amount: (562500/244036) * (25/19) = 14062500/4636684 lbs. This can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 4, resulting in approximately 3.01 lbs.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total length of materials needed, we need to add the length of the yarn and the length of the beads: (11/3) + (8/30).

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common denominator for 3 and 30 is 30. To get a denominator of 30 for the first fraction, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 10: (11/3) * (10/10) = (110/30)

Now we can add the two fractions: (110/30) + (8/30) = (118/30)

Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2: (118/30) Ã· (2/2) = (59/15). 

Therefore, Lara needs 59/15 feet of materials to make the necklace.

            Lara was pleased with her initial necklace design, but she decided she wants to add some larger beads to the necklace. These larger beads require an additional (24/17) feet of yarn. How many total feet of material will Lara now need to finish her necklace with the added beads?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the length of yarn required for the larger beads to the initial length of materials Lara needed for her necklace.  

This means adding (59/15) + (24/17).

First, we need to find the least common denominator for 15 and 17, which is 255. We get equivalent fractions with a denominator of 255:

- (59/15) * (17/17) = (1003/255)
- (24/17) * (15/15) = (360/255)

Now we can add the fractions: (1003/255) + (360/255) = (1363/255)

The fraction cannot be simplified further, so Lara needs 1363/255 feet of material to complete her necklace.

            Lara realized that she made a slight miscalculation. The amount of smaller beads she wants to add to the necklace extends its length by (8/28) feet not by (8/30) feet as she initially thought. Given this new information, how many total feet of material will Lara need to make her necklace, before adding the larger beads?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the length of yarn, (11/3) feet, and the adjusted length of smaller beads, (8/28) feet.

First, simplify the fraction representing the length of the smaller beads: (8/28) = (2/7)

Next, find a common denominator for (11/3) and (2/7). The least common denominator is 21.

Convert both fractions to have the common denominator: 
* (11/3) * (7/7) = (77/21)
* (2/7) * (3/3) = (6/21)

Now, add the two fractions: (77/21) + (6/21) = (83/21)

Therefore, Lara needs 83/21 feet of material for the yarn and smaller beads.

To find the difference, we subtract the distance traveled by Plane B from the distance traveled by Plane A:  24/11 - 26/27 
To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 11 and 27 is 297.
We convert both fractions to have a denominator of 297:  (24/11) * (27/27) - (26/27) * (11/11) = 648/297 - 286/297
Now we can subtract: 648/297 - 286/297 = 362/297

6/4 is equivalent to 24/16, so the total rate at which the candles burn is 24/16+14/16 = 38/16 inches per hour.

            Imagine you're a music producer who is working on a new song. Your resources are divided into different sections.

- First, you dedicate 16/4 hours to composing the music and another 16/29 hours to writing the lyrics. This is your initial time investment for the song (let's call it p).

- Then, you spend 28/13 hours for mixing and mastering the song in addition to the initial time investment (let's call this new total time b).

- Suddenly, a drummer you hired for a session uses 18/4 hours less because he finished his parts quickly.

What is the final time you spent on producing the song, if your total time is expressed as (b - (18 / 4))?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the calculation step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the initial time investment (p):**
   - Composing: 16/4 hours = 4 hours
   - Lyrics: 16/29 hours 
   - p = 4 + 16/29 hours

2. **Calculate the total time before the drummer's adjustment (b):**
   - b = p + 28/13 hours
   - b = (4 + 16/29) + 28/13 hours

3. **Calculate the drummer's time reduction:**
   - Reduction: 18/4 hours = 4.5 hours

4. **Calculate the final time spent:**
   - Final time: b - 4.5 hours
   - Final time: ((4 + 16/29) + 28/13) - 4.5 hours 

To get the final answer, let's simplify the expression:

-  ((4 + 16/29) + 28/13) - 4.5 
-  = 4 + 16/29 + 28/13 - 4.5
-  = 16/29 + 28/13 - 0.5 
-  = (208 + 812 - 377) / 377
-  = 643 / 377

            In addition to the colored pencils Marta uses for her art projects, she also has a pack of special metallic colored pencils. She uses 8 of these special pencils every 6 days. Adding these two amounts together, how many colored pencils in total does Marta use over an 11-day period? 

To find this, you need to add the fraction of colored pencils she uses from the previous problem to the amount of metallic pencils she uses. Evaluate this by performing the operation (8 / 6) + ((20 / 11) * (23 / 26)) and write your answer as a simplified fraction.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, find the total number of metallic colored pencils Marta uses over 11 days: (8 pencils / 6 days) * 11 days = 88/6 pencils.
Next, simplify the fraction representing the metallic pencils: 88/6 = 44/3
Now, add that fraction to the fraction representing the regular colored pencils Marta uses: (44/3) + (230/143) 
To add these fractions, find a common denominator: (44*143)/(3*143) + (230*3)/(143*3) = 6292/429 + 690/429
Finally, add the numerators together: (6292 + 690)/429 = 6982/429

            A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspectâ€™s involvement. Calculate the value of f.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Calculate indicator i**

* Specimen 1 decreases by 26 out of 6 units, which can be represented as a fraction: 26/6
* Specimen 2 decreases by 25 out of 17 units, represented as a fraction: 25/17 
* To find the ratio (indicator i), divide the first fraction by the second: (26/6) / (25/17) = (26/6) * (17/25) = 221/75

**Step 2: Calculate indicator h**

* Specimen 3 increases by 18 out of 8 units, represented as a fraction: 18/8
* Specimen 4 increases by 17 out of 23 units, represented as a fraction: 17/23
* To find the difference (indicator h), subtract the second fraction from the first: (18/8) - (17/23) = (207/92) - (68/92) = 139/92

**Step 3: Calculate indicator f**

* Multiply indicator i (221/75) by indicator h (139/92): (221/75) * (139/92) = 30719/6900

Later in the same year, a lioness is pregnant again but this time her gestation period reduces by 15/20 of a year compared to the earlier total gestation period of both animals. How long will it take for the lioness to give birth this second time?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we simplify the fraction representing the lioness's gestation period: 20/22 = 10/11 of a year.
Then, we calculate the total gestation period for both animals: 10/11 years + 15 years = 15 10/11 years.
Next, we determine the reduction in gestation period for the lioness: (15/20) * (15 10/11) years = 11 1/4 years.
Finally, we subtract the reduction from the initial total gestation period to find the new gestation period for the lioness: 15 10/11 years - 11 1/4 years = 4 29/44 years.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First find the total increase in production: 4/20 tonne = 1/5 tonne
Then, convert 1/5 to a fraction with a denominator of 8: 1/5 * 8/8 = 8/40
Add this increase to the daily production: 23/8 + 8/40 = 115/40 + 8/40 = 123/40 tonnes
Then, convert 19/24 to a fraction with a denominator of 40: 19/24 * 5/5 = 95/120
Simplify the fraction 95/120: 95/120 = 19/24
Then, convert 19/24 to a fraction with a denominator of 40: 19/24 * 5/5 = 95/120
Simplify the fraction 95/120: 95/120 = 19/24
Then, convert 19/24 to a fraction with a denominator of 40: 19/24 * 5/5 = 95/120
Simplify the fraction 95/120 again: 95/120 = 19/24
Finally, subtract this decrease from the increased production: 123/40 - 19/24 = 369/120 - 95/120 = 274/120 tonnes.
Simplify the fraction 274/120: 274/120 = 137/60 tonnes
Thus, the factory produces 137/60 tonnes of soap that day after the adjustments.

            Suppose, while creating the paint mixture you started with the revised amount of 24/8 gallons of red paint. However, this time instead of adding 1/28 gallon blue pigment, you added 1/21 gallon of blue pigment to adjust the color. 

Subtract this newer amount of blue pigment from 'd' to find 'x' in gallons, which is the total amount of paint. What is the value of 'x' now?

We know from the previous problem that 'd' (the amount of red paint after pouring some away) is 1.5 gallons. 
To find 'x', we subtract the new amount of blue pigment: x = 1.5 - 1/21 = 29/14 gallons.

We can simplify this by canceling common factors before multiplying. Notice that 182 is divisible by 2 twice (2*91=182), and 8 is divisible by 2 three times (2*2*2=8). We can also cancel a factor of 2 from the 4 in the denominator. This gives us: (459*2*2)/(91*2). 
We can cancel the remaining factor of 2 in the numerator and denominator, leaving: (459*2)/91.

            Sonia uses 21/12 oz of toothpaste to brush her teeth every day. Her brother Anthony uses less toothpaste, just 6/27 oz daily. Add both quantities of toothpaste to get the total daily amount used by Sonia and Anthony.

Now, suppose their mom includes an amount of toothpaste for herself to the total - she uses 3/18 oz of toothpaste daily.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, find a common denominator for Sonia's and Anthony's toothpaste usage: 21/12 and 6/27. The least common denominator is 108.
Then, convert each fraction to have the denominator of 108:
**(21/12) * (9/9) = 189/108**
**(6/27) * (4/4) = 24/108**

Now, add the fractions representing Sonia's and Anthony's toothpaste usage:
189/108 + 24/108 = 213/108

Next, find a common denominator for the total toothpaste usage by Sonia and Anthony (213/108) and their mom's usage (3/18). The least common denominator is 108.
Convert their mom's toothpaste usage to have a denominator of 108:
**(3/18) * (6/6) = 18/108**

Finally, add this fraction to the fraction representing the total toothpaste usage of Sonia and Anthony to find the total daily usage for the family:
213/108 + 18/108 = 231/108

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3:

However, upon weighing, he found that there was 17/22 ounces less cheese than he requested. Calculate how much cheese he actually received. Use the equation 'd = n - (17 / 22)' to find the answer.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We are given that Jeremy ordered n = 30/9 ounces of cheese.
We are also given the equation d = n - (17/22) to calculate the actual amount of cheese received, 'd'.
Substituting 'n' in the equation, we get: d = (30/9) - (17/22).
To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 9 and 22 is 198.
Therefore, d = (660/198) - (153/198) = 507/198.
Simplifying the fraction, Jeremy received 507/198 = 2.56 ounces of cheese.

Sophia decided to add these numbers to her total. Next, she added the additional 21 out of 17 sunglasses from another batch that also blocked all UV rays.

Later, she realized she made a mistake and needed to subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that actually did not block all UV rays.

            Shawn is making sandwiches for a picnic. The recipe for the sandwiches requires different amounts of mayonnaise and sandwich spread. 

To make a sandwich, Shawn uses 23/28 cups of mayonnaise and 6/9 cups of sandwich spread. How many cups of these two ingredients does Shawn use in total to make a sandwich?

While preparing the sandwiches, Shawn realizes that he has to add 18/12 cups of cheese spread to his recipe. Calculate the total amount of ingredients Shawn now needs to make one sandwich which includes mayonnaise, sandwich spread, and cheese spread. 

Finally, if Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, how many cups of ingredients will he use in total to make those sandwiches?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of mayonnaise and sandwich spread Shawn uses to make a sandwich, we add the fractions 23/28 and 6/9.
 
 To add these fractions, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 28 and 9 is 252. 

Converting the fractions to have the denominator 252, we get (23 * 9)/(28 * 9) = 207/252 and (6 * 28)/(9 * 28) = 168/252. 

Now, we can add the fractions: 207/252 + 168/252 = 375/252. 

Simplifying the fraction 375/252, we get 125/84.

Therefore, Shawn uses 125/84 cups of mayonnaise and sandwich spread in total to make a sandwich.

To calculate the total amount of ingredients Shawn needs after adding the cheese spread, we add 18/12 to 125/84.

Simplifying 18/12, we get 3/2.

To add 3/2 and 125/84, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 84 is 84.

Converting the fraction 3/2 to have the denominator 84, we get (3 * 42) / (2 * 42) = 126/84.

Now, we can add the fractions: 126/84 + 125/84 = 251/84.

Therefore, Shawn needs a total of 251/84 cups of ingredients to make one sandwich. 

Finally, if Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, he will use 4/4 cups of ingredients in total to make those sandwiches.

* 1/21 of a key set is equivalent to 1/21 * 6/6 = 6/126 of a key set

Now we can subtract the lost keys: 483/126 - 6/126 = 477/126

            James is making a decorative pillow and would like to add a matching border. He needs to calculate the length of border material he will need. The pillow is 23/9 feet long. He had an additional 22/25 feet of length due to the fluffing of the pillow. The total length is then multiplied by 16/13 to account for overlap and corners. Calculate the length of border material James will need for his pillow.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, find the total length of the pillow after fluffing: 23/9 + 22/25 = (575 + 198)/225 = 773/225 feet.
Then, multiply the total length by 16/13 to account for the overlap and corners: (773/225) * (16/13) = 12368/2925 feet.
This fraction can be simplified to 49472/11700, and further to 12368/2925, which equals 4 648/2925.

            In a book publishing company, the manager has to look after various departments. The editing team takes 20/5 hours to edit a manuscript of a book, while the typesetting team needs 18/17 hours to adjust the layout of a page. 

Some break delay happens that results in a collective loss of 6/15 hours. 

After these delays and losses, the manager, to compensate, extended the working hours by the same amount of time as the initial time span of the process. 

On a particular day, they continue to work. What's the total extended time in hours, if you multiply the time required for the entire process and the extended time after the reduction of the lost hours with the initial total time required?

First find the total initial time required for editing and typesetting: 20/5 hours + 18/17 hours = (340 + 90)/85 hours = 430/85 hours = 5.06 hours. 

Now, subtract the break delay to get the reduced time: 5.06 hours - 6/15 hours = 5.06 hours - .4 hours = 4.66 hours

The manager extends this reduced time by the initial total time: 4.66 hours + 5.06 hours = 9.72 hours

Finally, multiply this extended time by the initial total time to get the total extended time: 9.72 hours * 5.06 hours = 49.22 hours

One day, the beekeeper discovered that each honey storage sub-section had (25 / 9) gallons of honey. He also found the same amount of honey in each bee rearing sub-section. 

If he combined the honey from both a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the beekeeper would have a total quantity represented by 'p'. 

However, one honey storage sub-section had an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey. So, if the beekeeper was calculating the total amount from this sub-section plus a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be defined as 's'.

With this adjustment, and keeping the increased factor of 29/21 the same, how many cups of sugar did Heather use in total for her special three-course dinner?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First find the total amount of sugar originally needed with the adjusted amount for the bread recipe: 11/25 cups + 6/2 cups = 11/25 + 75/25 = 86/25 cups.
Then multiply the original amount of sugar by the increase factor to find the total amount of sugar used: 86/25 cups * 29/21 = 2494/525 cups.
Simplify the fraction: 2494/525 = 4 414/525.

If he drills each hole exactly once with his drill bit, calculate what fraction of the desired diameter would each hole have? Don't simplify the fraction, keep as (20/6) * (11 / 21).

Before we can subtract fractions, they need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 10 and 23 is their product, 230. Let's convert both fractions:

* (17/10) * (23/23) = 391/230

3. **Convert fractions:**
   * (18/10) * (23/23) = 414/230

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Grapes produced this season**

* The vineyard usually produces 19/2 baskets of grapes.
* This season, it produced 19/29 of the usual amount.
* To find the amount produced this season, multiply the usual amount by 19/29: (19/2) * (19/29) = 361/58 baskets

**Step 2: Jake's share**

* The total production this season was 361/58 baskets.
* Jake gets to keep 7/11 of this amount.
* Multiply the total production by Jake's share to find his portion: (361/58) * (7/11) = 2527/638 baskets

**Step 3: Grapes used for juice**

* Jake has 2527/638 baskets of grapes.
* He uses 9/10 of his grapes for juice.
* Multiply Jake's total grapes by 9/10 to find the amount used for juice: (2527/638) * (9/10) = 22743/6380 baskets

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

Let's calculate each part of the problem:

**Step 1: Total grapes with improved yield**

* The vineyard's normal yield is 19/2 baskets.
* Next season, it's expected to produce 19/13 times the normal yield.
* Multiply the normal yield by the expected increase to find the total production: (19/2)*(19/13) = 361/26 baskets

**Step 2: Jake's share**

* The total production next season is estimated to be 361/26 baskets.
* Jake gets 7/11 of the total production.
* Multiply the total production by Jake's share to find his portion: (361/26)*(7/11) = 2527/286 baskets

**Step 3: Grapes used for juice**

* Jake's share next season is 2527/286 baskets.
* He uses 9/10 of his grapes to make juice.
* Multiply Jake's total grapes by his usage for juice: (2527/286)*(9/10) = 22743/2860 baskets

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to determine how much *more* wildebeest the lion ate compared to the zebra.  To do this we subtract the fraction of zebra from the fraction of wildebeest: 23/9 - 28/26.

Before we can subtract fractions, they need to have a common denominator.  The least common denominator for 9 and 26 is 234.

To get a denominator of 234, we multiply 23/9 by 26/26: (23/9)*(26/26) = 698/234

And we multiply 28/26 by 9/9: (28/26)*(9/9) = 252/234

Now we can subtract: 698/234 - 252/234 = 446/234

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor of 2: 446/234 = (446/2)/(234/2) = 223/117

Teddy hides 18/11 of his friends in the forest and 8/21 of his friends at the beach. First calculate how many more friends Teddy hides in the forest than at the beach. Let's call this number 'f'.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, find a common denominator for the fractions 18/11 and 8/21. The least common denominator is 231. 
To get a denominator of 231 for 18/11, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 21: (18 * 21) / (11 * 21) = 378/231
To get a denominator of 231 for 8/21, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 11: (8 * 11) / (21 * 11) = 88/231
Now, subtract the fraction of friends at the beach from the fraction of friends in the forest: 378/231 - 88/231 = 290/231. So, 'f' = 290/231
To square a fraction, we square both the numerator and the denominator: (290 * 290) / (231 * 231) = 84100/53361. So, 'n' = 84100/53361

Teddy decides that the new challenge will require as many action points as there were hiding spots, but multiplied by the fraction of his friends who decided to take on the challenge.

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators: (18 * 84100) / (28 * 53361) = 1513800 / 1494108

First, we need to simplify our fractions. 24/14 simplifies to 12/7 and 9/29 cannot be simplified. Since 12/7 and 9/29 do not have a common denominator, we must find one. The least common denominator is 203, so we will rewrite 12/7 and 9/29 as 294/203 and 63/203. Now, we can find the difference: 294/203 - 63/203 = 231/203.
This means he used 231/203 yards of his original fabric.
Next, we multiply that number by 15/2 to figure out how many yards of new fabric he used: 231/203 * 15/2 = 3465/406, which simplifies to 85/14.

So, the cat eats 80/60 + 36/60 = 116/60 cans of cat food per day. This is more than 1 can since 116 is greater than 60. Simplifying the fraction 116/60, we get 29/15.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
First find the fraction of the pile the monkey eats: (22/7)*(10/25) = 220/175
We can simplify 220/175 to 44/35

Then convert 44/35 and 3/28 to fractions with a common denominator to easily subtract them:
The least common multiple of 35 and 28 is 140.
(44/35) * (4/4) = 176/140
(3/28) * (5/5) = 15/140
The monkey ate 176/140 of the bananas and gave away 15/140 of the bananas.

Subtract to find the fraction of bananas remaining: (176/140) - (15/140) = 161/140
Finally, subtract the fraction of bananas eaten and given away from 1 representing the whole pile to find the fraction of the pile remaining: 1- (161/140) = 140/140 - 161/140 = -21/140

            Turtle Tilly is collecting food for the winter. She has gathered 25/9 kg of sea plants, and she then finds 8/13 kg more. In a close-by rock, she spots another food stash weighing 24/27 kg. After gobbling up these finds, Tilly stumbles upon yet another food source weighing 21/26 kg. If Tilly combines all her found food, how many kilograms does she now have in total? Answer as a simplified fraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total weight, we need to add the weight of all the food Tilly found.

First, find the combined weight of the first two finds: 25/9 kg + 8/13 kg. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 9 and 13 is their product, 117. We get: (25/9)*(13/13) + (8/13)*(9/9) = 325/117 + 72/117 = 397/117 kg

Now, add the weight of the third find: 397/117 kg + 24/27 kg. The least common denominator for 117 and 27 is 351. We get: (397/117)*(3/3) + (24/27)*(13/13) = 1191/351 + 312/351 = 1503/351 kg

Finally, add the weight of the last find: 1503/351 kg + 21/26 kg. The least common denominator for 351 and 26 is 9126. We get: (1503/351)*(26/26) + (21/26)*(351/351) = 39078/9126 + 7371/9126 = 46449/9126 kg

This fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 1521: (46449/1521)/(9126/1521) = 31/6 kg

            Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements. 

What does Captain Alfâ€™s final calculation come to? Use these steps and corresponding fractions to find your answer.

            Callie owns a pen business. Last month, she sold 20 pens for every 15 she produced. At the same time, she sold an additional 16 pens for every 22 she put out for sale. 

Meanwhile, she found that for every 22 pens she advertised, 27 were interested customers. For each 23 pens she produced this week, she was able to sell 8. 

What is the result when she multiplies the ratio of last month's sales to production (20/15 + 16/22) and this week's figure for the ratio of interested customers to production (22/27 * 23/8)? Leave your answer as an unsimplified fraction.

            Consider a band practice session in which a musician played a song for exactly 30 minutes. After dividing this time equally between 15 songs, how much time did they spend on each song? From this average time per song, the band reduced the time spent on a particular song by 1/17 of an hour. Can you calculate the final duration of that song?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First find the average time spent on each song: 30 minutes / 15 songs = 2 minutes/song
Now, convert 1/17 of an hour to minutes: (1/17 hour) * (60 minutes/hour) = 60/17 minutes
Subtract the reduction from the average song length: 2 minutes - (60/17) minutes = (34-60)/17 = -26/17 minutes. 

### Answer:  This answer doesn't make sense because it results in a negative time. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  To solve this problem, we need to find a common denominator for all the fractions. The least common denominator for 26, 11, 28 and 19 is 15082.
- Floor Lamps: (4/26) * (578/578) = 2312/15082
- Desk Lamps: (15/11) * (1371/1371) = 20565/15082
- Table Lamps: (23/28) * (539/539) = 12497/15082
- Decorative Lamps: (8/19) * (806/806) = 6448/15082

Adding all the fractions: 2312/15082 + 20565/15082 + 12497/15082 + 6448/15082 = 41822/15082

* **Start:** Mike threw 9/19 of his snowballs, meaning he had some left over.
* **Finding More:** He finds 4 more snowballs.

The fact that John threw snowballs or how many Mike threw is irrelevant. To find the total Mike has *now*, we only need to focus on the fact that he found more. 

Since we don't know how many he started with, we can't get an exact number for how many he has in total.

            Debra is baking cookies and she realizes she has two different recipes for the same type of cookie. She's wondering if she combines the ingredients from both, if she will end up with even more cookies or not. 

The first recipe requires (27 / 3) cups flour and (11 / 7) cups sugar. She determines the ratio of flour to sugar by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar. She then subtracts (21 / 26) from this ratio because that's how many cups of sugar her friend says makes the cookies too sweet. After that, she adds (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio to see how many total cups of flour she will need. How many cups of flour will she have in the end?

Finally, add the flour from the second recipe to the adjusted ratio to find the total cups of flour:  (1407/286) + (22/9) = (1407*9 + 22*286)/(286 * 9) = 18921/2574

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
There are 26/13 = &lt;&lt;26/13=2&gt;&gt;2 chickens in the first farm.
There are 9/16*2 = &lt;&lt;9/16*2=9/8&gt;&gt;9/8 chickens in the second farm.
The difference in the number of chickens between the two farms is 2-9/8 = &lt;&lt;2-9/8=7/8&gt;&gt;7/8.
The number of chickens after a week is 7/8*19/21 = &lt;&lt;7/8*19/21=19/24&gt;&gt;19/24.

            Let's consider a modification in our previous problem. Instead of initially flying a distance of 24/14 miles for each exercise, the helicopter now travels a distance of 17/14 miles for each exercise. If we still let 'w' be the distance flown for each exercise and 't' be the total distance flown for both exercises, which is represented as the product of 'w' times 'w', what is the new value of 't'?

            A UFO has made two fuel stops. During the first refuel, the UFO was able to fill 20/16 of its fuel tank. At the second fuel stop, the UFO filled another 24/25 of its tank. Calculate the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total fraction of the tank refilled, we need to add the fractions from the two fuel stops: 20/16 + 24/25. 
To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator for 16 and 25 is 400.
We can rewrite 20/16 as 500/400 and 24/25 as 384/400.
Now we can add the fractions: 500/400 + 384/400 = 884/400.
Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4:  884/400 = 221/100.

            On the next mission, the UFO only managed to refill 30/16 of its fuel tank at the first stop, while at the second fuel stop, it still refilled 24/25 of its tank. What is the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops on this mission?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add the fractions from the two fuel stops: 30/16 + 24/25.

First, we find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 16 and 25 is 400.

Next, we convert each fraction to have the denominator of 400:
- 30/16 is equivalent to 750/400 (multiply numerator and denominator by 25)
- 24/25 is equivalent to 384/400 (multiply numerator and denominator by 16)

Now we can add the fractions: 750/400 + 384/400 = 1134/400

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2: 1134/400 = 567/200

            Professor Astro is working on his telescope. He believes the power of his telescope is directly proportional to the sum of two fractions. The first fraction is the light gathering power of the lens, which is 24 out of 27. The second fraction is the zooming potential, which is 30 out of 26. So, Professor Astro calculates the sum of these two fractions ((24 / 27) + (30 / 26)). What does he find?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator for 27 and 26 is their product, 702.

*   (24/27) is equivalent to (24 * 26) / (27 * 26) = 624/702
*   (30/26) is equivalent to (30 * 27) / (26 * 27) = 810/702

Therefore, (24/27) + (30/26) = (624/702) + (810/702) = 1434/702. 

This fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 6. This gives us 239/117.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total milk per cow, we need to add the morning and evening milk production. To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator for 14 and 20 is 140. 
We can get 14 to 140 by multiplying by 10, so we multiply our first fraction by 10/10: (26/14)*(10/10) = 260/140
We can get 20 to 140 by multiplying by 7, so we multiply our second fraction by 7/7: (28/20)*(7/7) = 196/140
Now we can add our two fractions: (260/140) + (196/140) = 456/140
This fraction can be simplified by dividing the top and bottom by 4: (456/4)/(140/4) = 114/35
