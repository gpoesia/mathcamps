        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let the edge length of the cube be  'x' mm.
The volume of a cube is calculated by the formula: Volume = x^3
We are given that the volume of the eraser cube is 512 mm^3. 
Therefore, x^3 = 512.
To find x, we need to find the cube root of 512. 
The cube root of 512 is 8, as 8 * 8 * 8 = 512.
So, the edge length 'x' is 8 mm.

The volume of a cuboid is given by length * width * height.
Since all sides are equal, the volume of the building is x * x * x = xÂ³ cubic meters.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Let the length of the edge of the cubical toothbrush holder be x cm. 
The volume of the cubical toothbrush holder = x*x*x cubic centimeters.
Thus, x*x*x = 1000 i.e. x^3 = 1000.
So, x = 10 as 10*10*10 = 1000.

We know the volume of the cube-shaped oven is 125 cubic inches, so 125 = fÂ³.
To find the side length (f), we need to find the cube root of 125, which is 5 because 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.
Therefore, the length of each side of the loaf is 5 inches.

            A guitarist uses a particular type of guitar string. The thickness of the string, in hundreds of a millimeter, cubed, will determine the pitch of a certain note, the guitarist wishes to play. If he needs the pitch to equal 343 Hz, what is the thickness of the string he should choose?

            A book is written with a unique style where every page is in the shape of a cube. If the volume of one page is 64 cubic inches, what is the side length of each page?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of a cube is calculated by the formula V = sÂ³, where 's' is the side length. We know V (volume) is 64 cubic inches. To find 's', we need to find the cube root of 64.  The cube root of 64 is 4, as 4 * 4 * 4 = 64. 
### Answer: 4 inches
