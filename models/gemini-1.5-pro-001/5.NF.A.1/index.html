        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
* First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 56, 23 and 26 to perform these operations. The least common denominator is 1624.
* We can then rewrite the problem as (48*29)/(56*29) + (95*70)/(23*70) - (34*62)/(26*62).
* This becomes 1392/1624 + 6650/1624 - 2108/1624.
* Adding the first two fractions gives us 8042/1624
* Subtracting the third fraction from the sum gives us 5934/1624
* Finally, we simplify the fraction 5934/1624 to its simplest form which is 2967/812

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add or subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 9, 65, and 37 is 21935. Therefore, we have:

88/9 + 28/65 - 18/37 = (88*2435)/(9*2435) + (28*337)/(65*337) - (18*595)/(37*595)
= 214280/21935 + 9436/21935 - 10710/21935
= (214280 + 9436 - 10710)/21935
= 213006/21935

The greatest common divisor of 213006 and 21935 is 29, so we can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 29:

213006/21935 = (213006/29)/(21935/29) = 7345/755

We can rewrite 41/77 as (41 * 41) / (77 * 41) = 1681 / 3157

We can rewrite 28/41 as (28 * 77) / (41 * 77) = 2156 / 3157.
We already know from the previous problem that 41/77 is equivalent to 1681 / 3157.

 To get a denominator of 455 for 56/35, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 13: (56*13)/(35*13) = 728/455.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
 We follow a similar approach as before, keeping in mind that the only change is the numerator of the first fraction.
 
 We already know the least common denominator for 65 and 35 is 455.
 
 To get a denominator of 455 for 25/65, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 7: (25*7)/(65*7) = 175/455
 
 We also know from before that 56/35 is equivalent to 728/455
 
 Now we can add the two fractions: 175/455 + 728/455 = 903/455
 
 This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 151: (903/151)/(455/151) = 6/3
 
 Finally, 6/3 simplifies to 2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 1 and 93 is 93. We can rewrite 88/1 as a fraction over 93: (88/1)*(93/93) = 8184/93. 
Therefore the problem becomes 8184/93 - 38/93. 
This simplifies to (8184 - 38)/93 = 8146/93.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we must simplify the fractions, 80/94 can be simplified to 40/47, and 78/59 cannot be simplified.
Next, we must find a common denominator; the least common denominator is 2773 (47 * 59), so we get (2280 / 2773) + (3654 / 2773).
Then we perform the addition: (2280 + 3654) / 2773 = 5934/2773.

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
First, we need to find the sum of 96/11 and 12/5. To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 11 and 5 is 55. 
Therefore:
96/11 + 12/5 = (96/11)*(5/5) + (12/5)*(11/11) = 480/55 + 132/55 = 612/55

Now, we need to subtract 38/87 from the result. Again, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator of 55 and 87 is their product, 4785.
Therefore:
612/55 - 38/87 = (612/55)*(87/87) - (38/87)*(55/55) = 53244/4785 - 2090/4785 = 51154/4785

            After considering the fruit you have, suppose you actually started off with a fraction of the fruits, having 96/58 oranges, and still having 12/5 apples. If you subtracted 38/87 of your total fruits for charity, what fraction of fruits would you have left? Please leave your answer as a fraction.

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
First, find the total number of fruits you started with by adding the fractions of oranges and apples.  The least common denominator of 58 and 5 is 290.

96/58 + 12/5 = (96/58)*(5/5) + (12/5)*(58/58) = 480/290 + 696/290 = 1176/290

Now, simplify this fraction: 1176/290 = 588/145

Next, determine what fraction of your total fruit you gave to charity.  The problem specifies this is 38/87.

To find the fraction of fruit remaining, subtract the fraction donated to charity (38/87) from 1 (representing the whole of your fruit before donating any).  

1 - 38/87 = 87/87 - 38/87 = 49/87

Finally, multiply the fraction of your total fruit (588/145) by the fraction remaining after the donation (49/87) to find the fraction of fruit you have left.

(588/145) * (49/87) = 28812/12615

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First find the sum of 80/91 and 26/24.  A common denominator for these fractions is their least common multiple, but since we're aiming for a simple answer, let's just multiply 91 by 24 to get a denominator of 2184.  Converting to this denominator we get (80*24)/(91*24) + (26*91)/(24*91) = 1920/2184 + 2366/2184 = 4286/2184. 
Next, convert 23/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 2184. That's (23*728)/(3*728) = 16744/2184.

This time, consider if there were originally 76/24 instead of 26/24. How would this affect the calculation?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Let's analyze the impact of changing 26/24 to 76/24. The new sum, 80/91 + 76/24, will be larger than the previous sum. Therefore, subtracting this new sum from 23/3 will yield a smaller result compared to the previous calculation.

Now, let's calculate the new expression:

1. **Calculate the sum:** 
   - Find a common denominator for 80/91 and 76/24 (again, 91*24 = 2184):
     - (80 * 24)/(91 * 24) = 1920/2184
     - (76 * 91)/(24 * 91) = 6916/2184
   - Add the fractions: (1920 + 6916)/2184 = 8836/2184

   - Convert 23/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 2184: (23 * 728)/(3 * 728) = 16744/2184
   - Subtract the fractions: 16744/2184 - 8836/2184 = 7908/2184

3. **Simplify:** 7908/2184 simplifies to 1977/546

To add 221/90 to 92/28, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 90 and 28 is 1260.
221/90 is equivalent to 3094/1260, and 92/28 is equivalent to 4140/1260.
Therefore, 3094/1260 + 4140/1260 = 7234/1260, which simplifies to 12057/2100.

First, rewrite 95/62 with the denominator 2542:
* 95/62 = (95 * 41) / (62 * 41) = 3895/2542

Now we can add: 5941/2542 + 3895/2542 = 9836/2542

Finally, simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we simplify (30/11) + (72/38). Both 30 and 11 are prime numbers so (30/11) remains as it is. We can simplify (72/38) to (36/19). Our expression now becomes (30/11) + (36/19). To add the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 11 and 19 is their product, which is 209. We can rewrite (30/11) as (570/209) and (36/19) as (396/209). Our expression now becomes (570/209)+(396/209), which simplifies to 966/209.

Next, we need to add the result to (81/34). Again, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 209 and 34 is 7106. We can rewrite (966/209) as (32844/7106) and (81/34) as (17091/7106). Our expression now becomes (32844/7106) + (17091/7106), which we can add directly to get 49935/7106. 

Therefore, the simplified answer is 49935/7106.

* Adding these fractions gives us: (768/408) + (51/408) = 819/408
* Now we simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3: (819/3) / (408/3) = 273/136
* Next, we need to add this simplified fraction to 41/96. The least common multiple of 136 and 96 is 1632.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We follow the same steps as before, but with 71/14 instead of 32/14.

1. **Simplify:** 71/14 cannot be simplified further. 22/47 also cannot be simplified.

2. **Common Denominator:** The least common denominator for 14 and 47 is their product, 658. So we have: 
   * (71/14) - (22/47) = (71*47)/(14*47) - (22*14)/(47*14) = 3337/658 - 308/658

3. **Subtract:** 3337/658 - 308/658 = 3029/658

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's solve this step-by-step.

First, we need to find a common denominator for 82/49 and 45/60. The least common denominator is 2940.
- Converting 82/49 to a fraction with denominator 2940: (82 * 60) / (49 * 60) = 4920 / 2940
- Converting 45/60 to a fraction with denominator 2940: (45 * 49) / (60 * 49) = 2205 / 2940

Now we can add the two fractions: 4920/2940 + 2205/2940 = 7125/2940. This is 'd'.

Finally, we add 'd' (7125/2940) to 99/59. Again, we need a common denominator, which is 2940.
- Converting 99/59 to a fraction with denominator 2940: (99 * 50) / (59 * 50) = 4950 / 2940

Adding the two fractions: 7125/2940 + 4950/2940 = 12075/2940

Simplifying this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (1470), we get 2415/588, which can be further simplified to 805/196.

First, we need to simplify the expressions inside the parentheses:
  * 8/91 cannot be simplified further.
  * 49/5 is already in its simplest form.

Next, we need to find a common denominator for 8/91 and 49/5 to add them. The least common multiple of 91 and 5 is 455:
 * (8/91) + (49/5) = (8 * 5)/(91 * 5) + (49 * 91)/(5 * 91) = 40/455 + 4459/455 = 4499/455

Now we need to subtract 32/76 from 4499/455. First, we simplify 32/76 to 8/19. Then, we find a common denominator for 4499/455 and 8/19. The least common multiple of 455 and 19 is 8645:

* (4499/455) - (8/19) = (4499 * 19)/(455 * 19) - (8 * 455)/(19 * 455) = 85481/8645 - 3640/8645 = 81841/8645

            Let's make a slight change to the previous problem. Instead of starting with ((8 / 91) + (49 / 5)), let's use ((26 / 91) + (49 / 5)) instead, still subtracting (32 / 76) from the result. What would be the new outcome? Provide your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

First, we need to simplify the expressions inside the parentheses:

* 26/91 can be simplified to 2/7 (dividing both numerator and denominator by 13)
* 49/5 is already in its simplest form.

Next, we need to find a common denominator for 2/7 and 49/5 to add them. The least common multiple of 7 and 5 is 35:

* (2/7) + (49/5) = (2 * 5)/(7 * 5) + (49 * 7)/(5 * 7) = 10/35 + 343/35 = 353/35

Now we need to subtract 32/76 from 353/35. First, we simplify 32/76 to 8/19. Then, we find a common denominator for 353/35 and 8/19. The least common multiple of 35 and 19 is 665:

* (353/35) - (8/19) = (353 * 19)/(35 * 19) - (8 * 35)/(19 * 35) = 6707/665 - 280/665 = 6427/665

 (78/45) + (89/36) = (78 * 4 / 180) + (89 * 5 / 180) = (312 / 180) + (445 / 180) = 757/180
 
 Next, add the fraction to itself:
 (757 / 180) + (757 / 180) = 1514 / 180

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they must have a common denominator.  The least common denominator of 35 and 85 is 595.

*  86/35 is equivalent to (86 * 17)/(35 * 17) = 1462/595

Therefore, the sum is (1462 + 476)/595 = 1938/595

This fraction can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 1938:

1938/595 = (1938 / 1938) / (595 / 1938) = 1/ (5/17) = 17/5

The sum of these two fractions is 12857/4982. Since the numerator is larger than the denominator, we know this fraction is greater than 1 and can be simplified. 
12857/4982 = 2 + 2893/4982
This fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by 37 to get 78/134, which cannot be simplified further.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator for 75 and 92 is their least common multiple.  However, finding the least common multiple of 75 and 92 will result in rather large numbers.  Since we only need to simplify the expression, let's simply multiply the denominators together and convert the fractions:

92/75 + 66/92 = (92*92)/(75*92) + (66*75)/(92*75) 
                   = 8464/6900 + 4950/6900
                   = 13414/6900

Now we simplify by finding the greatest common factor of 13414 and 6900, which is 2:

13414/6900 = (2*6707)/(2*3450)
                 = 6707/3450

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">From the previous problem, we know the sum of 92/75 + 66/92 is 6707/3450.  So the problem becomes:

97/17 - 6707/3450

To subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator.  The least common denominator for 17 and 3450 is 3450 (since 3450 is divisible by 17).  We can convert 97/17 to have a denominator of 3450:

97/17 = (97 * 203)/(17 * 203) = 19691/3450

Now we can subtract:

19691/3450 - 6707/3450 = 12984/3450

Finally, we simplify by finding the greatest common factor of 12984 and 3450, which is 6:

12984/3450 = (6 * 2164) / (6 * 575) = 2164/575

                   = 7636/6900 + 4950/6900
                   = 12586/6900

Now we simplify by finding the greatest common factor of 12586 and 6900, which is 2:

12586/6900 = (2 * 6293) / (2 * 3450)

And, 73/22 is equivalent to (73*65)/(22*65) = 4745/1430

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
First, we convert the whole number to a fraction: 51 = 51/1.
Then we get a common denominator for 51/1 and 93/8 by multiplying 51/1 by 8/8: (51/1)*(8/8)=408/8.
Now we can add 51 and 93/8:  408/8 + 93/8 = 501/8.
Next, we simplify 58/44 by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 2: 58/44 = 29/22
Then we get a common denominator for 501/8 and 29/22 by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by 11 and the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 4: (501/8)*(11/11)=5511/88 and (29/22)*(4/4)=116/88
Now we can add 501/8 and 58/44:  5511/88 + 116/88 = 5627/88. 
The fraction 5627/88 cannot be simplified as it doesnâ€™t have any common factors.

We need to add 38/53 to our previous result of 5627/88.
To do this, we need to find a common denominator for these two fractions. The least common multiple of 88 and 53 is 4664 (88 * 53).
We get a common denominator for 5627/88 and 38/53 by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by 53 and the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 88: (5627/88)*(53/53)=298131/4664 and (38/53)*(88/88)=3344/4664 
Now we can add 5627/88 and 38/53: 298131/4664 + 3344/4664 = 301475/4664.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  First, find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common denominator for 5 and 25 is 25. To get 25 in the denominator of 82/5, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 5: (82 * 5) / (5 * 5) = 410/25.

Now, the subtraction becomes: 410/25 - 98/25

Since we have the same denominator, we can directly subtract the numerators: (410 - 98) / 25 = 312/25

Therefore, the result of the fraction subtraction is 312/25.

Now we have: 1476/90 - 98/90

Since the fractions have the same denominator, subtract the numerators: (1476-98)/90 = 1378/90

 $70/22 = (2*5*7)/(2*11) = (5*7)/11 = 35/11$
 
 Next, we find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common denominator is $25\times11=275$. We can re-express our fractions as:
 
 $32/25 = (32\times11)/(25\times11) = 352/275$
 
 $35/11 = (35\times25)/(11\times25)=875/275$

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's calculate the sum with the adjusted fraction:

First, we simplify the first fraction:

$64/49$ is already in its simplest form, as 64 and 49 share no common factors other than 1.

Next, we simplify the second fraction (which remains the same as before):

$70/22 = (2*5*7)/(2*11) = (5*7)/11 = 35/11$

Now, we need to find a common denominator for our two fractions, 64/49 and 35/11.  The least common denominator is 49 * 11 = 539.

Let's express both fractions with the common denominator:

*  $64/49 = (64 * 11) / (49 * 11) = 704/539$
*  $35/11 = (35 * 49) / (11 * 49) = 1715/539$

Finally, we add the two fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: From the previous question, we know the sum of 7/2 and 51/25 is 277/50.  Now we need to add 86/39 to this sum.

To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 50 and 39 is 1950.

* 277/50 is equivalent to (277 * 39) / (50 * 39) = 10803/1950
* 86/39 is equivalent to (86 * 50) / (39 * 50) = 4300/1950

Now we can add the fractions: 10803/1950 + 4300/1950 = 15103/1950

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's first simplify (68/69) + (93/7).  Note that these fractions can't be simplified as they share no common factors in their numerator and denominator. We get a common denominator through multiplication: 
(68/69)*(7/7) + (93/7)*(69/69) = 476/483 + 6417/483 = 6893/483.
 
 Now let's add 3/46 to our previous result. Again, we need a common denominator:
(6893/483)*(46/46) + (3/46)*(483/483) = 317078/22218 + 1449/22218 = 318527/22218. This fraction can't be simplified further.
 
 While 318527/22218 is technically a monomial (a monomial can be a constant, a variable or a product of a constant and variables) the problem statement is technically incorrect. (68 / 69) + (93 / 7) is not a monomial, it is a binomial.  It is only after the addition operation is performed that it becomes a monomial.

First, simplify (54/12) to its simplest form, which is 9/2.

Now, we need a common denominator to subtract 9/2 from 318527/22218:
(318527/22218) - (9/2) = (318527/22218) - (9/2)*(11109/11109)

This gives us: (318527/22218) - (99981/22218) = 218546/22218

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's break down the expression step by step:

* **36 / 27 = 4 / 3** (Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 9)
* **80 / 10 = 8** 
* **73/79** cannot be simplified further

Therefore, the expression becomes: 
(4/3) + 8 - (73/79)

To add and subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. 
The least common denominator for 3, 1 (implied denominator of 8) and 79 is 3 * 79 = 237

Let's convert each term to have the denominator 237:

* (4/3) = (4 * 79)/(3 * 79) = 316/237
* 8 = (8 * 237)/237 = 1896/237
* (73/79) = (73 * 3)/(79 * 3) = 219/237

Now, the expression becomes:
316/237 + 1896/237 - 219/237 = 1993/237

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to add 1993/237 to 17/88. 

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. Let's find the least common multiple of 237 and 88:

* Prime factorize 237: 3 x 79
* Prime factorize 88: 2 x 2 x 2 x 11 
* LCM(237, 88) = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 11 x 79 = 20904

Now, let's convert our fractions to have this denominator:

* (1993/237) = (1993 * 88) / (237 * 88) = 175384 / 20904
* (17/88) = (17 * 237) / (88 * 237) = 4029 / 20904

Finally, we can add them:
175384/20904 + 4029/20904 = 179413/20904

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1.  Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

* To get 4026 as the denominator of the first fraction, we multiply both its numerator and denominator by 61: (75/66) = (75*61)/(66*61) = 4575/4026
* To get 4026 as the denominator of the second fraction, we multiply both its numerator and denominator by 66: (81/61) = (81*66)/(61*66) = 5346/4026
* Now, we can add the two fractions: (4575/4026) + (5346/4026) = (4575+5346)/4026 = 9921/4026
This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3: 9921/4026 = (9921/3) / (4026/3) = 3307/1342

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
We previously found that l = 1250/198.  To find c, we need to add 99/92 to l:

c = l + 99/92 = 1250/198 + 99/92

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 198 and 92 is 8976. Let's rewrite both fractions with this denominator:

1250/198 = (1250 * 46) / (198 * 46) = 57500 / 8976
99/92 = (99 * 98) / (92 * 98) = 9702 / 8976

Now we can add the fractions:

c = 57500/8976 + 9702/8976 = 67202/8976

Finally, we can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

First, we simplify 76/18 to 38/9.
Then, we find the sum of 38/9 and 21/99: 
38/9 + 21/99 = (38*11)/(9*11) + 21/99 = 418/99 + 21/99 = 439/99

            First, calculate the result of 58/49 + 31/34. Then, add that result to the fraction 74/38. What is the final result as a simple fraction?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
First find a common denominator for 58/49 and 31/34. The least common denominator is 1666. 
We get: (58 * 34)/(49 * 34) + (31 * 49)/(34 * 49) = 1972/1666 + 1519/1666 = 3491/1666
Now we need to add 74/38 to that result. Let's find the least common denominator for these two fractions, which is 3193:
(3491 * 19)/(1666 * 19) + (74 * 84)/(38 * 84) = 66329/31934 + 6216/31934
The result of this addition is (66329 + 6216)/31934 = 72545/31934
Finally, we can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 17: 
(72545/17) / (31934/17) = 4267/1879

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can simplify (8/42) by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 2: (8/42) = (8/2)/(42/2) = 4/21
Since Olivia read 4/21 of the novel after reading the same amount as Evan (51/18), in total she has read (4/21) + (51/18).
Before adding these fractions together, we must find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 21 and 18 is 126.
We can rewrite 4/21 as 24/126: (4 * 6)/(21 * 6) = 24/126
We can rewrite 51/18 as 357/126: (51 * 7)/(18 * 7) = 357/126
Adding these two fractions, we get (24/126) + (357/126) = 381/126
Finally, we can simplify 381/126 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 9: (381/9)/(126/9) = 42/14
We can further simplify 42/14 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 14: (42/14)/(14/14) = 3/1 = 3

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Pro:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's break down the calculation step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate 79/1 - 30/92**

*  79/1 simplifies to 79.
*  30/92 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives us 15/46.
*  Therefore, 79/1 - 30/92 = 79 - 15/46 

To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1 and 46 is 46.

*  Rewriting 79 as a fraction with a denominator of 46, we get (79 * 46) / 46 = 3634/46
*  Now we can subtract: 3634/46 - 15/46 = 3619/46

**Step 2: Subtract 61/63 from the result**

*  We need to subtract 61/63 from 3619/46. 
*  Again, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 46 and 63 is 2898.
*  Rewriting both fractions with a denominator of 2898:
    * (3619/46) * (63/63) = 228157/2898
    * (61/63) * (46/46) = 2806/2898
*  Finally, subtract: 228157/2898 - 2806/2898 = 225351/2898

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know from the previous problem that twice the fraction (58/26) is 58/13.
Now we need to add (49/66) to 58/13. To add fractions, we need a common denominator.
The least common denominator for 13 and 66 is their product, 858.
To get 858 in the denominator of 58/13, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 66: (58 * 66) / (13 * 66) = 3828/858
To get 858 in the denominator of 49/66, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 13: (49 * 13) / (66 * 13) = 637/858
Now we can add the two fractions: 3828/858 + 637/858 = 4465/858
This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9: (4465 / 9) / (858 / 9) = 496/94.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We start with the fraction 54/26.  Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2, so we simplify to 27/13.
The problem asks us to add two of this fraction: (27/13) + (27/13).
Since the fractions share the same denominator, we simply add the numerators: (27+27)/13 = 54/13.

 First, let's simplify (39/6): (39/6) = 13/2
 Next, let's find a common denominator for 2 and 49, which is 98.

 (67/49) = (134/98)
 Now, let's add the simplified fractions: (637/98) + (134/98) = 771/98
 Next, let's find a common denominator for 61 and 98, which is 5978.
 (100/61) = (9800/5978)
 (771/98) = (4626/5978)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We previously determined the sum of 85/1 and 83/69 to be 86 and 14/69.
Adding 21/86 to 86 and 14/69, we get: 86 and 14/69 + 21/86 
To add fractions, we need a common denominator.  The least common denominator for 69 and 86 is their product, as they share no common factors. However, we are only asked for the sum, not a simplified answer.

First, simplify 36/72 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 36: (36/36)/(72/36) = 1/2

Now find the least common multiple of 1118 and 2, which is 1118.

Rewrite 1/2 with a denominator of 1118: (1/2) * (559/559) = 559/1118

Finally, add the two fractions: 8471/1118 + 559/1118 = 9030/1118

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
* We know from the previous problem that the sum of 59/52 and 70/32 is 691/208.
* To add 691/208 to 42/41, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 208 and 41 is 208.
* We can rewrite 42/41 as an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 208 by multiplying by 5/5:  (42/41)*(5/5) = 210/208.
* Now we can add the fractions: 691/208 + 210/208 = 901/208

* First, find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, 52 and 32. The LCM of 52 and 32 is 416.
* To get a denominator of 416 in the first fraction, we multiply by 8/8: (74/52)*(8/8) = 592/416.
* To get a denominator of 416 in the second fraction, we multiply by 13/13: (70/32)*(13/13) = 910/416.
* Now we can add the fractions: 592/416 + 910/416 = 1502/416

First, find a common denominator for 1066 and 75. The least common denominator is 53300. 

Next, rewrite the fractions with this common denominator:

First, we need to simplify the fractions:
* 26/87 simplifies to 2/3 (because both numerator and denominator can be divided by 13).
* 92/88 simplifies to 23/22 (because both numerator and denominator can be divided by 4).
Now, let's add the simplified fractions (2/3) + (23/22):
* To add fractions, they need a common denominator, which is 66 in this case.
* (2/3) is equivalent to (44/66) and (23/22) is equivalent to (69/66).
* Therefore (44/66) + (69/66) = 113/66
Finally, we add the result to 26/57:
* (113/66) + (26/57) requires a common denominator, which is 1342
* (113/66) is equivalent to (2299/1342) and (26/57) is equivalent to (602/1342)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 18 and 61 is their product, 1188. Therefore, we rewrite the fractions as follows:

95/18 + 51/61 = (95 * 61)/(18 * 61) + (51 * 18)/(61 * 18) = 5795/1188 + 918/1188

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can add the numerators:

(5795 + 918)/1188 = 6713/1188

Therefore, the sum of 95/18 and 51/61 is 6713/1188.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator for 46 and 84 is their least common multiple. However, simplifying the first fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 46 gives us (93/46) = (3/2). The least common multiple of 2 and 84 is 84. Therefore, we need to rewrite (3/2) with a denominator of 84, which we can do by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 42: (3/2) * (42/42) = (126/84). Finally, we can subtract the fractions: (126/84) - (51/84) = 75/84. Simplifying this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 3 gives us our final answer: 25/28

Let's first simplify the fractions: 40/92 simplifies to 10/23 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4), and 32/3 remains the same.

Now, let's subtract 10/23 from 32/3. To do this, we need a common denominator:
* The least common multiple of 3 and 23 is 69.
* Converting 32/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 69:  (32 * 23) / (3 * 23) = 736/69
* Converting 10/23 to a fraction with a denominator of 69: (10 * 3) / (23 * 3) = 30/69

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, find the simplest form of 12/22 by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2: 12/2 = 6,  22/2 = 11, so 12/22 = 6/11
To add fractions, they must have the same denominator. The least common denominator of 76 and 11 is 836.
To get a denominator of 836 in the first fraction, multiply the numerator and denominator by 11: 91/76 * 11/11 = 1001/836
To get a denominator of 836 in the second fraction, multiply the numerator and denominator by 76: 6/11 * 76/76 = 456/836
Now, add the two fractions: 1001/836 + 456/836 = 1457/836
The fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by 11: 1457/11 = 132  836/11 = 76
So, 1457/836 = 132/76
The fraction can be further simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by 4: 132/4 = 33, 76/4 = 19, so 132/76 = 33/19

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 93, 47, and 4 is their least common multiple. However, since these numbers share no common factors, their least common multiple is simply their product: 93 * 47 * 4 = 17532.

* **Step 1: Express each fraction with a denominator of 17532.**
   * 88/93 = (88 * 47 * 4) / (93 * 47 * 4) = 16576/17532
   * 6/47 = (6 * 93 * 4) / (47 * 93 * 4) = 2232/17532
   * 92/4 = (92 * 93 * 47) / (4 * 93 * 47) = 40292/17532

* **Step 2: Add the fractions with the common denominator.**
   * (16576/17532) + (2232/17532) + (40292/17532) = 59100/17532

* **Step 3: Simplify the result by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.**
   * The GCF of 59100 and 17532 is 396. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 396 gives us: (59100/396)/(17532/396) = 149/44

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions: The least common multiple of 27 and 48 is 432.
We can rewrite (73/27) as (73 * 16) / (27 * 16) = 1168/432
We can rewrite (23/48) as (23 * 9) / (48 * 9) = 207/432
Now the expression becomes: (1168/432) - (207/432)
Subtracting the numerators, we get: (1168 - 207) / 432 = 961/432

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
From the previous problem, we know (73/27) - (23/48) is equivalent to 961/432.  So the problem is now (961/432) - (61/59).

The least common multiple of 432 and 59 is 25488.

We can rewrite (961/432) as (961 * 59)/(432 * 59) = 56699/25488.
We can rewrite (61/59) as (61 * 432) / (59 * 432) = 26352 / 25488.

Now the expression becomes: (56699/25488) - (26352/25488).

Subtracting the numerators, we get (56699 - 26352)/25488 = 30347/25488.

First, let's convert 47 1/4 to an improper fraction: (47 * 4 + 1) / 4 = 189/4

To add 189/4 and 24/67, we need a common denominator:
- The least common multiple of 4 and 67 is 268.
- 189/4 is equivalent to (189 * 67) / (4 * 67) = 12663/268
- 24/67 is equivalent to (24 * 4) / (67 * 4) = 96/268

Now we can add: 12663/268 + 96/268 = 12759/268

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
The wholesaler currently has 943/936 barrels and receives a shipment of 68/47 barrels. 
First, find a common denominator for 936 and 47. The least common multiple of 936 and 47 is 43992.
We can rewrite 943/936 as (943 * 47) / (936 * 47) = 44321/43992
We can rewrite 68/47 as (68 * 936) / (47 * 936) = 63648/43992
Adding the two amounts: 44321/43992 + 63648/43992 = 107969/43992
This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 23: (107969/23) / (43992/23) = 4694.3/1912.7
Since we need the answer as a simple fraction, we round the numerator and denominator to the nearest whole number: 4694/1913

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The problem asks us to add 71/32 to 156/65.  To add fractions, they must share a common denominator.  The least common denominator is the least common multiple of 65 and 32, which is 2080.  Therefore, we must convert both fractions to equivalent fractions that have 2080 as a denominator. Since 2080/65 = 32, we multiply the first fraction by 32/32 to get (156*32)/(65*32) = 4992/2080.  Since 2080/32 = 65, we multiply the second fraction by 65/65 to get (71*65)/(32*65) = 4615/2080.  The sum of these two fractions is (4992+4615)/2080 = 9607/2080
