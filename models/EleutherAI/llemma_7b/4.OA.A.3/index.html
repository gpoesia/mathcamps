            A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

In the first round, they could form a word with 47 letters, but due to a mistake, they had to remove 30 letters. Then, they figured out they could still add 10 more letters to this word. In the next round, they removed 3 of these letters from the updated word. How many letters were there in the word after this last deletion?

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            A park contains 43 Velociraptors. Then, the park added another set of dinosaurs which numbered 972, but as it so happens, each of these sections contained 27 dinosaurs. This meant the actual number of new dinosaur types added was less. After calculating the new dinosaur types, they found out that the number of Velociraptors was more. They found the difference and multiplied this difference by 7, as each of the Velociraptors laid 7 new eggs that week. How many total eggs were laid by the Velociraptors that week?

He then decides to make a new batch of chocolate using a special recipe. This recipe calls for a total of 38 grams of cocoa, but subtraction the weight of one piece from the 176g bars, plus an additional 26 grams of sugar.

Simultaneously, the chocolatier decides to create another batch of chocolates that needs a total of 38 grams of cocoa and 18 grams of milk.

            In the forest, a certain bird lays an average of 11 eggs per month. This month, the bird laid 4 times the average. Due to extreme weather conditions, the forest welcoming committee distributed an additional 40 eggs to various nests to support the bird population. How many eggs are there in the forest this month?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The bird laid 4 times the average, so the bird laid 11*4 = &lt;&lt;11*4=44&gt;&gt;44 eggs this month.
The forest welcoming committee distributed an additional 40 eggs to various nests, so there are 44+40 = &lt;&lt;44+40=84&gt;&gt;84 eggs in the forest this month.

In comparison, another wizard casts a spell that produces 460 glowing orbs in 20 days. What is the daily average here?

Now, let's assume that the difference in their daily averages times the second wizard's daily average is a magical constant represented by 'n'. Can you find out what 'n' is?

            Now consider instead that the star had only 38 neutrons initially, and then it gains only 4 more. This total number is then multiplied by 10, for a lower energy output. During an explosion, it still releases additional energy equivalent to 6 plus 25. Now, how much total energy does the star emit?

            A gardener planted 13 Sunflowers in his garden. The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed. By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on and the spots needed, then he doubled that total for no particular reason. How many did he end up with?

            A treasure chest contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds. Unfortunately, 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed. The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest. 

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

What is the value (m) of the remaining treasure?

            Princess Anna was playing a numbers game in the kingdom. In the first round of the game, she thought of two numbers: 7 and 10. She added them together.

In the second round, she thought of a number 29. She subtracted the result from the first round and then subtracted 8 more from that result.

In the final round, Princess Anna added the results from the first and second round and then multiplied the sum by the result from the second round. What was the final result of the Princess's game?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Princess Anna added 7 and 10 together.
7+10 = &lt;&lt;7+10=17&gt;&gt;17

In the second round, she subtracted 17-29 = &lt;&lt;17-29=-12&gt;&gt;-12 from the result from the first round.

In the final round, Princess Anna added the results from the first and second round.
17+(-12) = &lt;&lt;17-12=5&gt;&gt;5

In the final round, Princess Anna multiplied the sum from the first and second round by the result from the second round.
5*(-12) = &lt;&lt;5*-12=-60&gt;&gt;-60

            The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

            A bus has 37 passengers. At the next stop, 20 more passengers get on. Before the bus reaches to the next stop, 44 passengers get off. Now, suppose this remaining number of passengers each pays an $11 fare, but the bus company also deducts a $14 service fee from the total fare. How much revenue does the bus company get?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of golden giraffes is the same as the number of ginger giraffes.
The number of golden giraffes is 16.
The number of greyish giraffes is 46.
The total number of giraffes is 16+16+46 = &lt;&lt;16+16+46=88&gt;&gt;88.
