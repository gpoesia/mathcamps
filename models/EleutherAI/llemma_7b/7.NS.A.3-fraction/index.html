        Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Carla's initial production was 22/3 * 22/19 = &lt;&lt;(22/3)*(22/19)=(22*22)/(3*19)=484/57&gt;&gt;484/57 cucumbers per plant.
After adjusting her production method, Carla's production is 484/57 * 23/17 = &lt;&lt;(484/57)*(23/17)=(484*23)/(57*17)=1008/102&gt;&gt;1008/102 cucumbers per plant.

        King Arthur is calculating the costs for restoring his castle. The wall repairs cost 26/22 of his castle's annual budget. Meanwhile, the moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget. Finally, installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget. How much (expressed as a fraction of the castle's annual budget) has King Arthur spent on these projects in total?

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The first candle burns at a rate of 6/4 = &lt;&lt;6/4=1.5&gt;&gt;1.5 inches per hour.
The second candle burns at a rate of 14/16 = &lt;&lt;14/16=0.875&gt;&gt;0.875 inches per hour.
The total rate at which the two candles burn together is 1.5+0.875 = &lt;&lt;1.5+0.875=2.375&gt;&gt;2.375 inches per hour.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Sophia has 17/20 of a dollar. Her friend gives her another 1/4 of a dollar. After some time, her brother gives her 1 dollar.
Sophia has 17/20 + 1/4 + 1 = &lt;&lt;17/20 + 1/4 + 1 = 17/20 + 5/4 + 4/4 = 17/20 + 20/20 = 37/20&gt;&gt;37/20 of a dollar.
Sophia has 37/20 of a dollar.
37/20 of a dollar is the same as &lt;&lt;37/20 * 20/20 = 37/1 = 37&gt;&gt;37 dollars.

        Imagine you're a music producer who is working on a new song. Your resources are divided into different sections.

- First, you dedicate 16/4 hours to composing the music and another 16/29 hours to writing the lyrics. This is your initial time investment for the song (let's call it p).

- Then, you spend 28/13 hours for mixing and mastering the song in addition to the initial time investment (let's call this new total time b).

- Suddenly, a drummer you hired for a session uses 18/4 hours less because he finished his parts quickly.

What is the final time you spent on producing the song, if your total time is expressed as (b - (18 / 4))?

        A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspect’s involvement. Calculate the value of f.

The machine starts by mixing 24/8 gallons of red paint. It then pours away 12/8 gallons of the mix. Let 'd' represent the amount of red paint left in the machine.

Finally, the machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color, subtract that from 'd' to find 'x' in gallons, which is the total amount of paint. Find the value of 'x'.

        Let's suppose for a special recipe sandwich, you need to divide a wheel of cheese into 14 equal parts and a pickle jar into 18 equal parts. 

To make one special sandwich, you need 21 parts of the wheel of cheese and 7 parts from the pickle jar.

You've just made these sandwiches and you are down to ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of your original ingredients.

Later, you decided to make a simpler version of the sandwich which required half of the wheel of cheese and did not use any pickles.

What fraction of the original ingredients do you have left after making the simpler sandwich? Calculate the answer by subtracting (2 / 4) from the fraction you had after making the first sandwich.

One day, the beekeeper discovered that each honey storage sub-section had (25 / 9) gallons of honey. He also found the same amount of honey in each bee rearing sub-section. 

If he combined the honey from both a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the beekeeper would have a total quantity represented by 'p'. 

However, one honey storage sub-section had an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey. So, if the beekeeper was calculating the total amount from this sub-section plus a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be defined as 's'.

        Teddy is a bear who loves to play with numbers. One day, Teddy was playing with his favorite number, which just so happened to be 30/17. While playing, he saw another number, 18/15, and decided to add it to his favorite number. With this new number in mind, he then saw another, 24/13, and decided to multiply it by his new number. What is Teddy's final number?

        Johnny is building a scooter from scratch. He needs to drill holes into the scooter deck to attach the wheels. The size of each hole should be approximately (20/6) cm in diameter. Unfortunately, his drill bit only has a diameter of (11/21) cm. If he uses his current drill bit, he needs to drill a hole, move it over and drill again to achieve the diameter he needs. If he drills each hole exactly once with his drill bit, calculate what fraction of the desired diameter would each hole have? Don't simplify the fraction, keep as (20/6) * (11 / 21).

Suddenly, the car slows down and reduces his speed by 14/15 miles per minute. Officer Davis noted down the new speed of the car. Suddenly, the car increased its speed again by 30/15 miles per minute. What was the final speed of the car according to Officer Davis's radar gun?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The car slowed down by 14/15 - 13/4 = &lt;&lt;14/15 - 13/4 = 14/60&gt;&gt;14/60 miles per minute.
The car increased its speed by 30/15 - 14/60 = &lt;&lt;30/15 - 14/60 = 16/60&gt;&gt;16/60 miles per minute.
The car's final speed was 13/4 + 16/60 = &lt;&lt;13/4 + 16/60 = 13/4 + 8/30 = 13/4 + 4/15 = 13/4 + 1/15 = 13/4 + 1/5*3 = 13/4 + 3/20 = 39/20&gt;&gt;39/20 miles per minute.

        A bear spends 18 hours of the day sleeping. Given that each day has 24 hours, this bear spends 18/24th of each day asleep. For 27 days of the month, the bear's activity is tracked. Assume that the bear has a regular sleeping pattern. Calculate the fraction of time the bear has spent sleeping over the 27 days assuming each month has 13 weeks. Your answer should be the result of (18 / 24) * (27 / 13). Write your answer as a decimal.

Teddy hides 18/11 of his friends in the forest and 8/21 of his friends at the beach. First calculate how many more friends Teddy hides in the forest than at the beach. Let's call this number 'f'. Then square 'f' to find 'n', the total number of hiding spots Teddy needs. How many hiding spots does Teddy need?

One rainy day, the first snail started an hour earlier than the second. At the time when the second snail began, a third snail that covers 18/17 of a meter per hour also started moving. 

What is their total distance in meters 1 hour after all three have started moving? Compute the result using the operation ((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) for the first two snails' distance, and multiply this result by (18 / 17) for the total distance , including the third snail.

        Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements. 

What does Captain Alf’s final calculation come to? Use these steps and corresponding fractions to find your answer.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The first worker packages 26/18 = &lt;&lt;26/18=1.44&gt;&gt;1.44 pieces of chocolate in one minute.
The second worker packages 15/15 = &lt;&lt;15/15=1&gt;&gt;1 piece of chocolate in one minute.
The first worker packages 1.44+1 = &lt;&lt;1.44+1=2.44&gt;&gt;2.44 pieces of chocolate in one minute.

        Debra is baking cookies and she realizes she has two different recipes for the same type of cookie. She's wondering if she combines the ingredients from both, if she will end up with even more cookies or not. 

The first recipe requires (27 / 3) cups flour and (11 / 7) cups sugar. She determines the ratio of flour to sugar by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar. She then subtracts (21 / 26) from this ratio because that's how many cups of sugar her friend says makes the cookies too sweet. After that, she adds (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio to see how many total cups of flour she will need. How many cups of flour will she have in the end?

She will need 6 - (21/26) = &lt;&lt;6-(21/26)=(6*26)-(21)=(156)-(21)=135&gt;&gt;135 cups of flour.
She will need 135 + (22/9) = &lt;&lt;135+(22/9)=(135*9)+(22)=(1215)+(22)=1237&gt;&gt;1237 cups of flour.

        Professor Astro is working on his telescope. He believes the power of his telescope is directly proportional to the sum of two fractions. The first fraction is the light gathering power of the lens, which is 24 out of 27. The second fraction is the zooming potential, which is 30 out of 26. So, Professor Astro calculates the sum of these two fractions ((24 / 27) + (30 / 26)). What does he find?
