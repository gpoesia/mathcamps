            A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

            A young boy with a creative mind decided to build a kite. He started with 37 paper straws but decided that 4 were unnecessary and removed them. Later, he realized his kite was still too bulky and removed another 23 straws. He multiplied the remaining number of straws by 45, subtracted 49 from that total, and then took out 7 more straws. How many straws did the boy have left?

            At the zoo, there were 2 trips being hosted. Each trip was allowed to see 2 animals. However, each animal had 3 baby animals with them, making the number of animals seen per trip multiplied by 3. If each baby animal could be photographed 21 times, how many photos could be taken in total? Also, if 34 photos were spoiled and unusable out of the entire batch, but guests were given the opportunity to take an additional 30 photos later, how many usable photos would there be in total?

            The snowfall in City A, which lasts for 50 days, is currently 36 days in. In City B, there is a unique snow pattern where for every 14 days, it snows 98 inches. The total snowfall in inches in City A is expected to be the product of the remaining snowfall days in City A and the average daily snowfall in inches in City B. However, the snow removal has been keeping up and has managed to remove an amount of snow equal to the average daily snowfall in City B. How much snow in inches is left in City A after the snow removal?

            A chocolatier has decided to make small chocolate bars that weigh 176 grams each. To get the right size, he divides each bar into 8 pieces, which means each piece weighs a certain number of grams. 

He then decides to make a new batch of chocolate using a special recipe. This recipe calls for a total of 38 grams of cocoa, but subtraction the weight of one piece from the 176g bars, plus an additional 26 grams of sugar.

Simultaneously, the chocolatier decides to create another batch of chocolates that needs a total of 38 grams of cocoa and 18 grams of milk.

What is the difference in the total weight of ingredients between the second and third batch of chocolates?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The weight of one piece is 176/8 = &lt;&lt;176/8=22&gt;&gt;22 grams.
The weight of the second batch of chocolates is 38-22+26 = &lt;&lt;38-22+26=32&gt;&gt;32 grams.
The weight of the third batch of chocolates is 38+18 = &lt;&lt;38+18=56&gt;&gt;56 grams.
The difference in the total weight of ingredients between the second and third batch of chocolates is 56-32 = &lt;&lt;56-32=24&gt;&gt;24 grams.

            The previous problem had us determine the total number of police officers on duty under certain conditions. Now, let's imagine a slightly different scenario.

Like the previous situation, there were still 32 officers assigned to the north district and 33 sent to the south. The number for the downtown district was also the same, at 29. However, this time around, only 21 officers from the total force were transferred elsewhere instead of the original scenario's subtraction. A week later, an additional 22 officers, fewer than the 39 from the original scenario, were brought in for a different assignment. That same day, another addition of 14 officers was made, just like with the initial series of events. 

New question: How many officers total were on duty by the end of the day in this amended scenario?

21 officers were transferred elsewhere, so 94-21 = &lt;&lt;94-21=73&gt;&gt;73 officers were on duty at the end of the day.
22 officers were added to the remaining duty force, so 73+22 = &lt;&lt;73+22=95&gt;&gt;95 officers were on duty at the end of the day.
14 officers joined the force, so 95+14 = &lt;&lt;95+14=109&gt;&gt;109 officers were on duty at the end of the day.

            A gardener planted 13 Sunflowers in his garden. The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed. By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on and the spots needed, then he doubled that total for no particular reason. How many did he end up with?

            A treasure chest contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds. Unfortunately, 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed. The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest. 

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

29-17 = &lt;&lt;29-17=12&gt;&gt;12
12-8 = &lt;&lt;12-8=4&gt;&gt;4

In the final round, Princess Anna added the results from the first and second round and then multiplied the sum by the result from the second round.

17+4 = &lt;&lt;17+4=21&gt;&gt;21

            Following the princess' first game, her little sister, Princess Bella, wanted to join in with her own twist. Bella did as follows:

In the first round, Bella copied Anna and added the same two numbers: 7 and 10 together.

For the second round, sister Bella thought of the number 33. Just like Anna, She subtracted the result from the first round and then decreased it by 8.

In the final round, Princess Bella, like Anna, added the results from the first and second round. Then, she multiplied the sum by the result from her modified second round. What was the final result of Princess Bella's game?

            The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

            Let's reconsider the original scenario where the reserve started with ginger giraffes. But this time assume that the reserve initially had 42 ginger giraffes instead of 16. They again brought in the same number of golden giraffes as the ginger ones. Later, they decided to add another group of 46 greyish giraffes. What would be the total number of giraffes in the reserve now under this new scenario?

            A turtle decides to swim. One day, it travels as many leagues as 11 plus 10, then multiplies that by 16 to get the total distance it swam that week. Later, it realized it had over calculated the distance by 41 leagues. What is the real distance it swam that week?

            Continuing from the previous scenario, consider that the turtle realizes that it originally miscalculated the daily travel distance. Instead of swimming 11 leagues plus 10 a day, it actually swam 11 leagues plus 17 leagues a day. After multiplying that daily total by 16 for the week, and subtracting the over-calculated 41 leagues, how much did the turtle actually swim in the originally estimated week?

The turtle over calculated the distance by 41 leagues.
