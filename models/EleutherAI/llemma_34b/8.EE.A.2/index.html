We can solve for s by dividing both sides of the equation by s^2.
V/s^2 = s^3/s^2
V/s^2 = s
s = V/s^2
s = 512/s^2
s^3 = 512
s = 8
The size of one side of the tank is 8 meters.

            <span class="response-field">LLemma 34B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cuboid is given by the formula V = lwh.
Since the building has a uniform cross-sectional area all along its height, the width and depth are equal.
So, the volume of the building is given by V = lw^2.
216 = lw^2
w^2 = 216/l
w = sqrt(216/l)
Since the building height, width and depth are all equal, the length in meters of one side is given by l = w = sqrt(216/l).

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cuboid is given by the formula V = lwh.
Since the length, width, and height are the same, we can write V = l^3.
We can solve for l by taking the cube root of both sides of the equation.
l = cuberoot(V) = cuberoot(1000) = &lt;&lt;cuberoot(1000)=10&gt;&gt;10
