His friend gifts him more apples such that the total count is now 92 more than his initial count. This time, however, his neighbour gifts him another 64 apples instead of 24. How many apples does Mark have in this scenario?

            Let's change the scenario a bit. Suppose the student does everything as before, rotating an angle to form 92 degrees, and again by an additional of 84 degrees to form shape 't'. Then they modify shape 't' by adding another 90 degrees to form shape 'l'. But this time, instead of rotating an additional 66 degrees for shape 'n', he rotates by 30 degrees. What would be the total degree measure of the rotations made to get to shape 'n' in this case?

            Mike's left binocular lens can magnify objects from a distance of 30 miles away, and the right lens can magnify objects that are 56 miles away. He also has a telescope that can magnify objects from a distance of 67 miles away. What is the total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects?

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous problem, we considered the distance that Mike's binocular's two lenses can magnify. Consider now that we made a mistake and that the left lens can actually magnify objects from a distance of 54 miles away instead of 30 miles. Keeping the right lense and the telescope the same at 56 and 67 miles respectively, what would be the new total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects?

            As an extension to the previous problem, let's say Quintus the wizard then decides to cast an ancient and profound spell. To cast this spell, he needs to gather an additional number of Quiblets equivalent to his most powerful spell, plus 50 more. How many Quiblets does Quintus the wizard need in total to cast this ancient spell?
