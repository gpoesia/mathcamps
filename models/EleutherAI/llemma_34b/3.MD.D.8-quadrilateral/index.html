        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of the rectangle is 210m.
The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(45+x) = &lt;&lt;2(45+x)=90+2x&gt;&gt;90+2x.
210 = 90+2x
&lt;&lt;210=90+2x&gt;&gt;210 = 90+2x
&lt;&lt;210-90=2x&gt;&gt;210-90 = 2x
&lt;&lt;120=2x&gt;&gt;120 = 2x
&lt;&lt;120/2=x&gt;&gt;120/2 = x
&lt;&lt;60=x&gt;&gt;60 = x
The length of each of the other two sides is 60m.
