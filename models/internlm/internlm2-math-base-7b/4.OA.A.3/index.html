            A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe.
The biologist counted 598/26 = &lt;&lt;598/26=23&gt;&gt;23 penguins in each of 26 ice floes.
The biologist counted 23*26 = &lt;&lt;23*26=598&gt;&gt;598 penguins in total.
The penguin population increased by 49, so the biologist counted 35+49 = &lt;&lt;35+49=84&gt;&gt;84 penguins in total.
The biologist took 33 more penguins into account, but then subtracted 10, so she counted 33-10 = &lt;&lt;33-10=23&gt;&gt;23 penguins in total.
The biologist added 20 adults and 14 chicks, so she counted 23+20+14 = &lt;&lt;23+20+14=57&gt;&gt;57 penguins in total.
The biologist counted 84+57 = &lt;&lt;84+57=141&gt;&gt;141 penguins in total.

            A young boy with a creative mind decided to build a kite. He started with 37 paper straws but decided that 4 were unnecessary and removed them. Later, he realized his kite was still too bulky and removed another 23 straws. He multiplied the remaining number of straws by 45, subtracted 49 from that total, and then took out 7 more straws. How many straws did the boy have left?

            At the zoo, there were 2 trips being hosted. Each trip was allowed to see 2 animals. However, each animal had 3 baby animals with them, making the number of animals seen per trip multiplied by 3. If each baby animal could be photographed 21 times, how many photos could be taken in total? Also, if 34 photos were spoiled and unusable out of the entire batch, but guests were given the opportunity to take an additional 30 photos later, how many usable photos would there be in total?

The total snowfall in inches in City A is expected to be the product of the remaining snowfall days in City A and the average daily snowfall in inches in City B. However, the snow removal has been keeping up and has managed to remove an amount of snow equal to the average daily snowfall in City B. How much snow in inches is left in City A after the snow removal?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total snowfall in City A is 14*9.5 = &lt;&lt;14*9.5=136&gt;&gt;136 inches. The total amount of snow removed in City A is 9.5*50 = &lt;&lt;9.5*50=475&gt;&gt;475 inches. The final total snowfall in City A is 136-475 = &lt;&lt;136-475=-339&gt;&gt;-339 inches.

            A towel company initially produced 30 beach towels and 6 hand towels. They then gave away 7 towels for charity, which leaves a certain amount of towels. They then decided to produce 14 more towels to add to their current stock. 

On the other hand, they made a special batch of 13 towels for every towel left after their charity activity and deducted 19 towels from this special batch, calling it their premium collection. They then noted 20 towels were damaged and removed it from this premium collection. 

After this, they deducted 3 more towels from the remaining premium collection and combined it with the total they had after their second batch of production. 

How many towels does the company have now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The company has &lt;&lt;30+6=36&gt;&gt;36 towels in the beginning. 
7 towels were given away, so the number of towels left is 36-7= &lt;&lt;36-7=29&gt;&gt;29. 
The company then decided to produce 14 more towels, so the new number of towels is 29+14= &lt;&lt;29+14=43&gt;&gt;43. 
The company made a special batch of 13 towels for every towel left after their charity activity, so the new number of towels is 43-19= &lt;&lt;43-19=24&gt;&gt;24. 
20 towels were damaged and removed from the premium collection, so the new number of towels is 24-20= &lt;&lt;24-20=4&gt;&gt;4. 
The company then deducted 3 more towels from the remaining premium collection, so the new number of towels is 4-3= &lt;&lt;4-3=1&gt;&gt;1. 
The company then combined the total they had after their second batch of production, so the new number of towels is 1+43= &lt;&lt;1+43=44&gt;&gt;44. 
The company has 44 towels now.

            A park contains 43 Velociraptors. Then, the park added another set of dinosaurs which numbered 972, but as it so happens, each of these sections contained 27 dinosaurs.

He then decides to make a new batch of chocolate using a special recipe. This recipe calls for a total of 38 grams of cocoa, but subtraction the weight of one piece from the 176g bars, plus an additional 26 grams of sugar.

Simultaneously, the chocolatier decides to create another batch of chocolates that needs a total of 38 grams of cocoa and 18 grams of milk.

            A jewelry maker starts with 38 beads to make a bracelet. However, the number of beads was not right, so she removed a number of beads equal to dividing 560 by 40. However, she thinks her initial count may have been wrong and she may have actually started with 15 more beads than she initially thought. After adjusting the count and removing some beads, she adds one more bead, and then 39 more. How many beads does the jewelry maker have now?

            In a different scenario, suppose the jewelry maker initially had 50 beads instead of 38. She still removed a number of beads equal to 560 divided by 40. Afterwards, she realized she might have actually started with 15 more beads than she originally thought. After correcting her count and removing some beads, she added one more bead, and then 39 more beads. How many beads does the jewelry maker have now in this case?

            A toothpaste factory produces 26 tubes of toothpaste every hour. On Sundays, they work for 7 hours and produce additional 8 tubes of toothpaste. So, in one Sunday, they produce ((26 * 7) + 8) tubes.

The following Monday, they continue their production by adding another 31 tubes to their Sunday's total.

In parallel, in the packaging department, they have 50 empty boxes. They use 19 of them for another department, leaving them with (50 - 19) boxes.

The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is calculated by adding the packaged boxes number with Monday's production.

On Tuesday, they produced an additional 48 tubes of toothpaste. What is the total number of produced toothpaste tubes until Tuesday, inclusive?

            A gardener planted 13 Sunflowers in his garden. The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed. By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on and the spots needed, then he doubled that total for no particular reason. How many did he end up with?

            A treasure chest contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds. Unfortunately, 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed. The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest. 

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

            There are 6 confirmed UFO sightings in a small city. After a viral event, sightings increase by a daily average obtained by dividing an additional 504 sightings over the next 14 days. Subtract the initial confirmed sightings from this new daily average. Then, multiply it by the result of taking the maximum number of sightings recorded in one day (9) and subtracting the number you would typically dismiss as random (3). How many sightings are there according to this calculation?

            Lemonville is a small village known for its lemon trees. One year, the villagers picked 38 baskets of lemons from the trees near the river and 24 baskets from the ones near an old well. From the trees near the school, they picked 16 more baskets and from the trees near the mayor's house, they picked 13 more baskets. They realized that their lemons were heavier and they could extract more juice so they decided to get 35 baskets to make lemonade. If each basket of lemons could produce 14 bottles of lemonade, how many bottles of lemonade would they get from the remaining baskets?

            The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

            Let's reconsider the original scenario where the reserve started with ginger giraffes. But this time assume that the reserve initially had 42 ginger giraffes instead of 16. They again brought in the same number of golden giraffes as the ginger ones. Later, they decided to add another group of 46 greyish giraffes. What would be the total number of giraffes in the reserve now under this new scenario?
