            A baby was receiving 658 milliliters of milk each day. One day, the baby's pediatrician advised to increase the milk intake by 18 milliliters. How much milk is the baby receiving after the increase? 

Now, consider that the baby also needs to consume 67 milliliters of water daily in addition to the milk she is receiving. How much total liquid - milk and water - is the baby consuming every day now?

            In the previous scenario, the baby was receiving 658 milliliters of milk each day. But let's consider a different situation. Suppose that the baby was initially receiving 380 milliliters of milk each day. If the baby's pediatrician still advised to increase the milk intake by 18 milliliters, how much milk is the baby receiving daily in this new situation?
