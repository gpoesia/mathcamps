        A kite festival had 577 kites in the sky at its peak. After some time, 256 kites were taken down. How many kites remained in the sky?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 256/577 = &lt;&lt;256/577=0.4412&gt;&gt;0.4412 of the kites were taken down.
577 × 0.4412 = &lt;&lt;577*0.4412=0.253224&gt;&gt;0.253224
