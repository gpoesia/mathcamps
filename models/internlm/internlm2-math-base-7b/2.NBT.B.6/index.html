            Looking at the painting in the gallery, the artist realizes that the painting is not quite balanced. She thinks back to the painting competition, and remembers that if she had originally used 81 blue strokes instead of 53, her painting might have been more harmonious. Keeping all other elements the same, and doubling the total number of strokes for her painting just like before, she wonders how many strokes would there have been in her painting if she had made this change. How many strokes would there have been?
