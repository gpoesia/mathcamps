            Using the fencing for his property as a guide, Mike decided to build a smaller fence for his dog's play area. He started with 82 feet of fencing again, but this time, he added an extra 2 feet at the start. After checking the area, he decides he needs to add an extra 12 feet, instead of the 10 feet from the previous setup. How many feet of fencing will Mike need in total for the dog play area?

            In the original scenario, the construction worker thought he needed to lay 98 feet of pipe. He then realized he overestimated and removed 58 feet. However, on revisiting the project plan, it turns out that instead of the initial additional 52 feet, he only needs to add 33 feet to the remaining pipe to complete it. How long, in feet, will the plumbing line be given this new requirement?
