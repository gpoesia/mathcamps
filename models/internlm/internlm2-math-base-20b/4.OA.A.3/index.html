        A songwriter creates a long ballad with many verses. Each verse has 162 words and he divides these into 18 lines per verse. This gives a certain number of words per line. To each line, he adds 34 more words as a refrain. What is the total number of words present in each line now?

        A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

        If a cloud releases 47 millimeters of rainfall per hour over a one hour period, and the average cloud typically releases 775 millimeters of rainfall over the course of 31 hours, find the amount of rainfall from the following condition. 

Subtract 22 from the average rainfall of the typical cloud per hour then multiply this by 23. Add this result to a constant cloud factor of 42. Add this new result to the hourly rainfall of the initial cloud and subtract 2 from it. What is the resultant millimeters of rainfall?

25 - 22 = &lt;&lt;25-22=3&gt;&gt;3 millimeters of rainfall per hour for the average cloud. 

3 * 23 = &lt;&lt;3*23=69&gt;&gt;69 millimeters of rainfall per hour for the average cloud.

        A park contains 43 Velociraptors. Then, the park added another set of dinosaurs which numbered 972, but as it so happens, each of these sections contained 27 dinosaurs. This meant the actual number of new dinosaur types added was less. After calculating the new dinosaur types, they found out that the number of Velociraptors was more. They found the difference and multiplied this difference by 7, as each of the Velociraptors laid 7 new eggs that week. How many total eggs were laid by the Velociraptors that week?

        A toothpaste factory produces 26 tubes of toothpaste every hour. On Sundays, they work for 7 hours and produce additional 8 tubes of toothpaste. So, in one Sunday, they produce ((26 * 7) + 8) tubes.

The following Monday, they continue their production by adding another 31 tubes to their Sunday's total.

In parallel, in the packaging department, they have 50 empty boxes. They use 19 of them for another department, leaving them with (50 - 19) boxes.

The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is calculated by adding the packaged boxes number with Monday's production.

On Tuesday, they produced an additional 48 tubes of toothpaste. What is the total number of produced toothpaste tubes until Tuesday, inclusive?

Now, consider a different Sunday where they changed their production to 22 tubes every hour instead, while still working for 7 hours and producing 8 additional tubes. They continue their production on Monday by adding an additional 31 tubes.

The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total.

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

        There are 6 confirmed UFO sightings in a small city. After a viral event, sightings increase by a daily average obtained by dividing an additional 504 sightings over the next 14 days. Subtract the initial confirmed sightings from this new daily average. Then, multiply it by the result of taking the maximum number of sightings recorded in one day (9) and subtracting the number you would typically dismiss as random (3). How many sightings are there according to this calculation?

        Lemonville is a small village known for its lemon trees. One year, the villagers picked 38 baskets of lemons from the trees near the river and 24 baskets from the ones near an old well. From the trees near the school, they picked 16 more baskets and from the trees near the mayor's house, they picked 13 more baskets. They realized that their lemons were heavier and they could extract more juice so they decided to get 35 baskets to make lemonade. If each basket of lemons could produce 14 bottles of lemonade, how many bottles of lemonade would they get from the remaining baskets?

        Recall the pirate's adventure. But let's say, originally the treasure chest he found had 42 times the amount of his previous loot of 13 gold coins instead of 3 times. After spending 22 of these coins for the crew's rum, and discovering another loot of 47 gold coins, how many gold coins does the pirate have now?

He spent 22 of these coins, so he has 546-22 = &lt;&lt;546-22=524&gt;&gt;524 gold coins.
He found another loot of 47 gold coins, so he has 524+47 = &lt;&lt;524+47=571&gt;&gt;571 gold coins.

        A cat started playing with yarn balls. In her first game, she managed to accumulate 5 yarn balls. In her second game, she got as many balls as the square of what she obtained in the first game plus 8 more. Finally, she lost some of her balls in her third game due to a playful dog. She ended the game with a number of balls which is 25 times the difference between 45 and what she accumulated from the second game. How many yarn balls does the cat have now?

        The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of squares needed for hours is 37-32 = &lt;&lt;37-32=5&gt;&gt;5. The number of squares needed for minutes is 25. The number of squares needed for seconds is 28. The total number of squares needed is 5+25+28 = &lt;&lt;5+25+28=58&gt;&gt;58. The total number of squares needed is 58-23 = &lt;&lt;58-23=35&gt;&gt;35.

However, imagine what would have happened had the farm originally been producing a lesser daily output, such as 7 pounds. If they were still able to double this amount each day of the 15-day harvest period and added the same 16 pounds of the rare orange variant to their yield, how much would the farm have produced in that case?
