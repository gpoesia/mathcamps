        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The clown took a total break of 13/5 = &lt;&lt;13/5=2.6&gt;&gt;2.6 hours.
She performed for 1.325 hours.
The clown had 2.6-1.325 = &lt;&lt;2.6-1.325=1.275&gt;&gt;1.275 hours remaining after her performance time is subtracted from her total break time.
