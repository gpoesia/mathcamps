        A mountain has a cuboidal shape and its volume is 64 km^3. If all of the sides of this cuboid are of equal length, what is the length of each side in kilometers?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cuboid is given by the formula V = l^3, where l is the length of each side. Since the volume of the mountain is 64 km^3, we can set V = 64 and solve for l.
64 = l^3
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
l = 4
Therefore, the length of each side of the mountain is 4 kilometers.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the length of one edge by itself twice. In other words, the volume of a cube is the length of one edge cubed. We can use this information to find the length of one edge of the cube. We know that the volume of the cube is 27 cubic kilometers. We can write this as 27 = &lt;&lt;27=3^3=3*3*3=27&gt;&gt;3^3 = 3*3*3 = 27. This means that the length of one edge of the cube is 3 kilometers. Therefore, the length of one edge of the cube is 3 kilometers.

        A pencil-shaped building has a cuboidal structure. The building has a uniform cross-sectional area all along its height. When the volume of the building is calculated, it comes out to be 216 cubic meters. If the building height, width and depth are all equal, what is the length in meters of one side?

        In a video game, a player notices that a treasure chest contains an item cube with a volume of 729 cubic units. What is the length of each side of the item cube?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 729 = 3^6 = &lt;&lt;3^6=729&gt;&gt;729.
The length of each side of the item cube is 3^2 = &lt;&lt;3^2=9&gt;&gt;9 units.

        A cookie dough is kneaded into a cube shape before baking. If the dough has a volume of 512 cubic cm, what is the length of each side of the cube in cm?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The length of each side of the cube is the cube root of 512.
The length of each side of the cube is &lt;&lt;512^(1/3)=8&gt;&gt;8 cm.

        The cubic area of the compass box is 729 cubic cm. What is the length of one edge of this cubical compass box, given that it is a cube?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The length of one edge of a cube is the cube root of the volume of the cube.
The length of one edge of the compass box is 729^(1/3) = &lt;&lt;729^(1/3)=9&gt;&gt;9 cm.
