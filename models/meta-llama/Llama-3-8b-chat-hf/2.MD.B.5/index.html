104 - 62 = 42

Hank now needs to dig 42 more feet to reach the new planned length.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's call the initial length of the timber piece &quot;x&quot;. Since the first piece measures 66 feet, the remaining piece is x - 66 feet. This remaining piece was then accidentally cut into two pieces, one of which is 19 feet. This means that the remaining piece was cut into two pieces, so the length of the remaining piece is 19 feet. We can set up an equation to represent this:

x - 66 = 19

To solve for x, we can add 66 to both sides of the equation:

x = 19 + 66

x = 85

So, the initial length of the timber piece is 85 feet.

This remaining piece was then accidentally cut into two pieces, one of which is 19 feet. This means that the remaining piece was cut into two pieces, so the length of the remaining piece is 19 feet. We can set up an equation to represent this:

            Peter originally had a 67 foot long rope, but he used some of it for other projects. After extending his current 21 foot long rope with an extra foot to measure a greater span in his garden, how much of the original rope does he have left?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Peter originally had a 67 foot long rope. He used some of it for other projects, which means he has less than 67 feet left. Let's call the amount he has left &quot;x&quot;.

He then extends his current 21 foot long rope with an extra foot, making it 22 feet long. This means he has used 22 feet of the original rope.

To find out how much of the original rope he has left, we subtract the amount he used (22 feet) from the original length (67 feet):

67 feet - 22 feet = 45 feet

So, Peter has 45 feet of the original rope left.

            In the construction project, after the worker had laid down a pipe that was 61 feet long and added a 3 feet segment, another team of workers came to inspect and found that 49 feet of the pipe already laid didn't meet the safety regulations and needed to be removed.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, the total length of the pipe was 64 feet (61 feet already laid down + 3 feet additional segment). However, 49 feet of the pipe didn't meet the safety regulations and needed to be removed.

To find the length of the faulty segment, we subtract the length of the faulty segment from the total length of the pipe:

64 feet - 49 feet = 15 feet

This means that 15 feet of the pipe is still good and meets the safety regulations. To find the new total length of the pipe, we subtract the length of the faulty segment from the initial total length:

64 feet - 49 feet = 15 feet

x = 25

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The farmer extended the field by 30 meters, making it 100 meters long. However, he then reduced the cultivated area by 29 meters.

To find the new length, we subtract the reduction from the extended length:

The total distance Simon covered is the sum of the distance he swam and the distance he ran: 39 + 42 = &lt;&lt;39+42=81&gt;&gt;81 meters.

            A landscaper is designing a new park. He decided to make the park 75 meters long, but in the middle, he wants to have a 25 meters long garden. How long will be the park area that is not covered by the garden?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The park is 75 meters long, and the garden is 25 meters long. To find the length of the park area that is not covered by the garden, we need to subtract the length of the garden from the total length of the park.

Let's break it down:

* Total length of the park: 75 meters
* Length of the garden: 25 meters

To find the length of the park area that is not covered by the garden, we subtract the length of the garden from the total length of the park:

75 - 25 = 50

So, the park area that is not covered by the garden is 50 meters long.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Travis bought 2 cassette tapes initially, one that is 19 inches long and another that is 62 inches long. The total length of these two tapes is 19 + 62 = 81 inches.
He then buys an additional tape that is 6 inches long. To find the total length of all the tapes, we add the length of the additional tape to the total length of the initial tapes: 81 + 6 = 87 inches.
