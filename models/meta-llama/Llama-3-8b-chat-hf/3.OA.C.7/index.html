            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the starfish are to be distributed equally across 9 tanks, we can find the number of starfish that would be in each tank by dividing the total number of starfish by 9.

Let's say the total number of starfish is x. Then, the number of starfish in each tank would be x Ã· 9.

We know that the total number of starfish is 12, so we can set up the equation:

x Ã· 9 = 1 (since we want to find the number of starfish that would result in 1 starfish per tank)

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 9:

x = 9

So, the number of starfish that would result in equal distribution across 9 tanks is 9.

Since Jetstream has 5 times the strength of Green Gauntlet, Jetstream's strength is 5 times the strength of Green Gauntlet. So, Jetstream's strength is 5(3x) = 15x.

The distance the stuntman needs to walk is the length of the tightrope, which is the height of the tightrope multiplied by 2 (since it is a straight line from one side to the other). So, the distance is 50 x 2 = 100 feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how much milk the cow produces in a day, we need to divide the total amount of milk produced in 10 days by 10.
72 liters / 10 days = 7.2 liters/day
Now, we need to find out how much milk the cow would produce in 2 additional days (12 - 10 = 2 days).
7.2 liters/day * 2 days = 14.4 liters
Adding this to the total amount of milk produced in 10 days, we get:
72 liters + 14.4 liters = 86.4 liters

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The wizard staff can channel the spell for 60 minutes, but it needs a 1-minute break after every 6 periods. This means the total time spent channeling the spell is 60 minutes minus the time spent on breaks. The time spent on breaks is 1 minute x 5 breaks = 5 minutes. So, the total time spent channeling the spell is 60 - 5 = 55 minutes. Since the staff channels the spell for 6 equal periods, we can divide the total time spent channeling the spell by 6 to find the length of each period: 55 minutes / 6 = 9.17 minutes.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the height of the penguin be h. Since it takes the penguin 28 seconds to reach a depth that is 4 times its own height, we can set up the equation:

Time = Distance / Speed

28 = (4h) / (h)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

28 = 4

Now, we can find the height of the penguin:

h = 28 / 4
= 7

So, the height of the penguin is 7.

The depth the penguin reaches is 4 times its height, which is:

Depth = 4h
= 4(7)
= 28

Now, we need to find the square of the depth:

Square of the depth = (28)^2
= 28 Ã— 28

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the total number of towers remains the same (36), we can still divide it by the new number of walls (10) to find the number of towers on each wall:

36 Ã· 10 = 3.6

Since you can't have a fraction of a tower, we round down to the nearest whole number:

3.6 â†’ 3

So, there would be 3 towers on each wall if the castle actually has 10 walls.
