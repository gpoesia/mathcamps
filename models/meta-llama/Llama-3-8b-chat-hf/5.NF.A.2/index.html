            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of bananas given to Johnnie in the morning, we need to simplify the fraction 18/7. We can do this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. This gives us 6/1, or simply 6. So, Johnnie was given 6 bananas in the morning.

In the afternoon, Johnnie was given 12/14 bananas. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives us 6/7. So, Johnnie was given 6/7 bananas in the afternoon.

To find the total number of bananas given to Johnnie, we add the number of bananas given in the morning and the number of bananas given in the afternoon. This gives us 6 + 6/7 = 6 + 0.86 = 6.86 bananas.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Ralph's recipe requires 17/3 liters of apple juice, but he only uses 15/11 liters. To find the difference, we need to subtract the amount used from the amount required:

(17/3) - (15/11) = ?

To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 33. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

(17/3) = (187/33)
(15/11) = (165/33)

Now, we can subtract:

(187/33) - (165/33) = (22/33)

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Miss Jenny spent 8 hours on one subject. She spent an additional 20/19 hours on another subject. To find the total hours spent on the second subject, we need to convert the mixed number to an improper fraction: 20/19 = 1 1/19. Then, we add the hours spent on both subjects: 8 + 1 1/19 = 9 1/19. To convert this mixed number to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 1/19 = 0.0526. Then, we add this decimal to the whole number part: 9 + 0.0526 = 9.0526. Since we can't spend a fraction of an hour, we round this decimal to the nearest tenth: 9.1 hours. Therefore, Miss Jenny spent 8 + 9.1 = &lt;&lt;8+9.1=17.1&gt;&gt;17.1 hours grading papers in total.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance Jack rides his scooter, we need to add the distance he rides to the library and the distance he rides to his grandparents' house.

The distance he rides to the library is 3/9 of a mile. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

3 Ã· 3 = 1
9 Ã· 3 = 3

So, the distance he rides to the library is 1/3 of a mile.

The distance he rides to his grandparents' house is 17/15 of a mile. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

17 Ã· 1 = 17
15 Ã· 1 = 15

So, the distance he rides to his grandparents' house is 17/15 of a mile.

To add these distances, we can convert both to decimal form:

1/3 = 0.33
17/15 = 1.13

Now, we can add these decimal values:

0.33 + 1.13 = 1.46

Therefore, Jack rides his scooter a total of 1.46 miles.

Joe's binoculars increase his range of sight by 1 mile, which is 16/16 * 1 mile. When they use the binoculars one after the other, the total increase in range is the sum of the two: (3/14 + 16/16) * 1 mile. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 56.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Maria uses 15/10 yards of fabric for the first section. To find the equivalent fraction with a denominator of 18, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2, getting 30/20 yards. For the second section, Maria uses 9/18 yards. To find the equivalent fraction with a denominator of 20, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 1, getting 9/18 yards. Now we can add the two sections together: 30/20 + 9/18 = 30/20 + 9/20 = 39/20 yards.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The painter uses 18/11 liters of blue paint and 1/8 liters of white paint. To find the total amount of paint used, we need to add these two amounts together.

First, we can simplify the fractions by finding the common denominator, which is 88.

18/11 = 72/88
1/8 = 11/88

Now we can add the two amounts:

72/88 + 11/88 = 83/88

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of gold, we need to convert both fractions to a common denominator, which is 26 in this case.

12/13 = 12 Ã— (2/2) / 13 = 24/26
3/2 = 3 Ã— (13/13) / 2 = 39/26

Now, we can add the two amounts:

24/26 + 39/26 = 63/26

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

63 Ã· 3 = 21
26 Ã· 3 = 8.67

So, the total amount of gold is 21 8/13 pounds.

Now, we need to find the total amount of food given to the monkeys and giraffes. Mary gave the monkeys 6/20 pounds of food, which can be simplified to 3/10 pounds. She gave the giraffes 18/19 pounds of food.
To find the total amount of food given, we add the amounts given to the monkeys and giraffes: 3/10 + 18/19. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 190. So, we rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 190: (38/190) + (18/19). We can simplify 18/19 to 171/190. Now, we can add the fractions: (38/190) + (171/190) = (209/190).

            In the previous treasure hunt, Captain Hook had originally found 11/8 ounces of gold. But let's say, instead of finding 5/5 ounces of gold as he did in his latest treasure hunt, he discovered 7/5 ounces of gold. How much total weight of gold would Captain Hook have had then?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Captain Hook initially had 11/8 ounces of gold.
He finds an additional 7/5 ounces of gold.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 40. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:
11/8 = 22/16
7/5 = 28/20
Adding these fractions, we get:
22/16 + 28/20 = 110/80
Simplifying the fraction, we get:
11/8 + 7/5 = 11/8 + 14/8 = 25/8 ounces
### Answer: 25/8 ounces.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Mr. Carpenter takes 5/3 hours to build the frame and 10/13 hours to upholster it. To find the total time, we need to add these two times together.

First, we can find a common denominator for the fractions by multiplying both the numerator and denominator of 5/3 by 13 and multiplying both the numerator and denominator of 10/13 by 3. This gives us:

5/3 = 65/39
10/13 = 30/39

Now we can add the two times together:

65/39 + 30/39 = 95/39

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

95/39 = 19/7.7

So, it takes Mr. Carpenter 19/7.7 hours to build a chair from start to finish.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of fabric needed, we need to add the amount of fabric needed for the outer layer and the liner.

For the outer layer, Johnathan needs 12/14 yards of fabric. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

12 Ã· 2 = 6
14 Ã· 2 = 7

So, the simplified fraction is 6/7 yards of fabric.

For the liner, Johnathan needs 8/5 yards of fabric. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

8 Ã· 1 = 8
5 Ã· 1 = 5

So, the simplified fraction is 8/5 yards of fabric.

Now, we can add the simplified fractions to find the total amount of fabric needed:

6/7 + 8/5

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 35.

6/7 = (6 Ã— 5) / (7 Ã— 5) = 30/35
8/5 = (8 Ã— 7) / (5 Ã— 7) = 56/35

Now, we can add the fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Jonathan needs 86/35 yards of fabric in total to create his sleeping bag. He has 17 yards of fabric in total. To find out how many yards he has left after using the necessary fabric, we need to subtract the amount of fabric needed from the total amount of fabric he has.

17 - 86/35

To subtract these values, we need to convert the mixed number 86/35 to an improper fraction:

86/35 = 246/35

Now, we can subtract:

17 - 246/35

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 35.

17 = 17 Ã— 1 = 17/1

Now, we can subtract:

17/1 - 246/35

To subtract these fractions, we need to subtract the numerators and keep the same denominator:

17 - 246 = -229

So, the result is -229/35. Since we cannot have a negative amount of fabric, we can convert this mixed number to an improper fraction:

-229/35 = -229 Ã· 35 = -6 29/35

So, Jonathan has -6 29/35 yards of fabric left after using the necessary fabric to create his sleeping bag.

            In the previous problem, Johnathan originally thought he needed 12/14 yards of one fabric to create the sleeping bag.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Johnathan originally thought he needed 12/14 yards of fabric, but now he realizes he only needs 12/17 yards. To find the difference, we can subtract the new amount from the original amount:

12/14 - 12/17

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 238.

12/14 = (12 Ã— 17) / (14 Ã— 17) = 204/238
12/17 = (12 Ã— 14) / (17 Ã— 14) = 168/238

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

204/238 - 168/238 = 36/238

So, Johnathan actually needs 36/238 yards less of the outer layer fabric.

The liner fabric remains the same at 8/5 yards.

To find the total amount of fabric needed, we can add the amount of fabric needed for the outer layer and the liner:

(12/17) + (8/5)

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 85.

12/17 = (12 Ã— 5) / (17 Ã— 5) = 60/85
8/5 = (8 Ã— 17) / (5 Ã— 17) = 136/85

Now, we can add the fractions:

60/85 + 136/85 = 196/85

So, Johnathan actually needs 196/85 yards of fabric in total to create his sleeping bag.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total acreage, we need to add the acreage of pine trees and oak trees.

The acreage of pine trees is 5/4 acres, which can be converted to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 5 Ã· 4 = 1.25 acres.

The acreage of oak trees is 1/2 acre, which can also be converted to a decimal: 1 Ã· 2 = 0.5 acres.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The ballerina's original routine is 13/5 minutes long. To shorten it by 15/16 minutes, we need to subtract 15/16 from 13/5.

First, we need to find a common denominator for 5 and 16, which is 80. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

13/5 = 104/80
15/16 = 75/80

Now, we can subtract:

104/80 - 75/80 = 29/80

So, the ballerina's routine is shortened by 29/80 minutes. To find the new length of the routine, we subtract this from the original length:

13/5 - 29/80 = 13/5 - 29/80 = 104/80 - 29/80 = 75/80 = 3/4

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's first find the distance Max rode in the afternoon. He rode 1/9 miles less than in the morning, so we can set up an equation:

Afternoon distance = Morning distance - 1/9

We know the morning distance is 9/7 miles, so we can substitute:

Afternoon distance = (9/7) - 1/9

To simplify the fraction, we can find a common denominator, which is 63:

Afternoon distance = (63/7) - (7/9)
= (63 - 7)/9
= 56/9

So Max rode his scooter 56/9 miles in the afternoon.

The blue shark swam 2/4 miles, which can be simplified to 1/2 miles.

The great white shark swam 9/14 miles.

To add this distance to the total, we need to find a common denominator, which is 70. So, we can rewrite the distances as:

            In the previous situation, let's imagine that the blue shark actually swam for only 2/4 miles and the hammerhead shark swam for 7/11 miles. In this case, how many miles did the blue and hammerhead sharks swim in total?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance swum, we need to add the distances swum by each shark.

The blue shark swam 2/4 miles, which can be simplified to 1/2 miles.

The hammerhead shark swam 7/11 miles.

To add these distances, we need to find a common denominator, which is 44. So, we can rewrite the distances as:

Blue shark: 22/44 miles
Hammerhead shark: 28/44 miles

Now, we can add the distances:

22/44 + 28/44 = 50/44

(4/9) + (9/4) = ?

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 36. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 36:

(4/9) = (16/36)
(9/4) = (27/36)

8/11 = (8 Ã— 19)/(11 Ã— 19) = 152/209

Now we can add the original length and the extension:

18/19 + 152/209 = (18 Ã— 209) + (152 Ã— 19) / (19 Ã— 209) = 3756 + 2888 / 3611 = 6644/3611

            If a dress designer used 11/4 yards of red fabric, and then added 5/17 yards of blue fabric, how many yards of fabric did she use in total?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of fabric used, we need to add the amount of red fabric and the amount of blue fabric.

First, we can simplify the fraction of red fabric by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

11/4 = 11/4

Next, we can add the simplified fraction of red fabric and the fraction of blue fabric:

11/4 + 5/17 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 68 (the least common multiple of 4 and 17). Then, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 68:

11/4 = 187/68
5/17 = 130/68

Now we can add the fractions:

187/68 + 130/68 = 317/68

So, the total amount of fabric used is 317/68 yards.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The fireplace burns 12/17 cord of wood in the morning and 8/19 cord in the evening. To find the total cord of wood burned in a day, we need to add these two fractions.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 17 and 19 is 323. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 323:

12/17 = 228/323
8/19 = 152/323

Now, we can add the two fractions:

228/323 + 152/323 = 380/323

6/19 + 17/4

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 76. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

Now we can add:

3/38 + 17/4 = (3*19) / (38*4) + 17/4 = 57/152 + 17/4

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 152. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

57/152 + 76/152

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The fireplace burns 4/15 cords per hour in the early morning, and 14/15 cords per hour in the late night.
The total amount of firewood burned in one hour is the sum of the amount burned in the early morning and the late night: 4/15 + 14/15 = 18/15 = 1 3/15 = 1.2/1 = 1 2/10 = 1.2.

            If the colonial fireplace burns firewood at a combined rate of 4/15 cords per hour in the early morning and 14/15 cords per hour in the late night, and during the peak hours, it burns an additional 6/5 cords per hour. Then how much total firewood does the fireplace burn in one hour considering early morning, late night, and peak hours?

            Continuing from the previous scenario, let's suppose the colonial fireplace in the early morning burns firewood at a slightly different rate of 8/15 cords per hour instead of 4/15 cords per hour.  The late night burning rate remains the same at 14/15 cords per hour. Given these new circumstances, how much firewood does the fireplace burn in total in one hour split between the early morning and late night?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The fireplace burns 8/15 cords per hour in the early morning, and 14/15 cords per hour in the late night.
The total amount of firewood burned in one hour is the sum of the amount burned in the early morning and the late night: 8/15 + 14/15 = 22/15 = 1 7/15 = 1.46/1 = 1 7/10 = 1.46.

            An alien travelled 9/20 of a light year towards earth then decided to move forward another 11/7 light years. How many light years has the alien travelled in total?

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The alien travelled 9/20 of a light year initially. To find the total distance travelled, we can multiply this by the fraction of a light year: 9/20 Ã— 1 = 9/20 light year.
The alien then travelled another 11/7 light years. To find the total distance travelled, we can add this to the initial distance: 9/20 + 11/7 = 63/140 + 110/140 = 173/140 light year.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Bob has 10/2 = 5/2 = 2.5/1 = 2 1/2 of a cucumber.
Bob adds 1/7 of another cucumber, which is 1/7 = 0.14 (approximately).
Bob has 2.5 + 0.14 = 2.64 (approximately) of a cucumber.
