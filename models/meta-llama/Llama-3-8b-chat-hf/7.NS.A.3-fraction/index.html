        Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?

        Pierre has 19/4 kg of grapes. One afternoon, he ate 7/25 kg of them. In the evening, his mother gave him 30/9 kg more grapes. How many kilograms of grapes does Pierre have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Pierre had 19/4 kg of grapes initially.
He ate 7/25 kg of them, so he has 19/4 - 7/25 kg left.
To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 100. So, we can rewrite the fractions as 76/100 and 28/100.
Now, we can subtract: 76/100 - 28/100 = 48/100 kg.
In the evening, his mother gave him 30/9 kg more grapes. To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 100. So, we can rewrite the fractions as 3200/100 and 48/100.
Now, we can add: 3200/100 + 48/100 = 3248/100 kg.

        King Arthur is calculating the costs for restoring his castle. The wall repairs cost 26/22 of his castle's annual budget. Meanwhile, the moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget. Finally, installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget. How much (expressed as a fraction of the castle's annual budget) has King Arthur spent on these projects in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The wall repairs cost 26/22 of the budget, which is equivalent to 11/10 of the budget (since 26/22 = 11/10).
The moat renovations cost 4/29 of the budget.
The defensive catapults cost 11/3 of the budget.
Adding these costs together, we get: (11/10) + (4/29) + (11/3) = (33/30) + (4/29) + (110/30) = (33+4+110)/30 = 147/30 = 49/10.

        A giraffe at the local zoo has a peculiar eating habit. When it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves, it eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day. If the zoo calculates the weekly feeding amount by multiplying the daily intake by itself (making the result &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;) and then multiplying that with the regular daily intake, how many pounds of acacia leaves should they prepare for the giraffe for a week? Calculate ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26))^2 * ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26)) and provide your answer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the usual daily intake of the giraffe. Let's call it x. Then, we can set up the equation:

(25/19) = (30/26)x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

25*26 = 19*30
650 = 570
x = 650/26
x = 25

So, the usual daily intake is 25 lbs. Now, we can find the daily intake when the giraffe is fed 25/19 lbs:

(25/19) * (30/26) = 25/19 * 30/26 = 25*30/19*26 = 750/578

Now, we need to calculate the weekly feeding amount squared and then multiply it with the regular daily intake:

((750/578)^2) * (25) = (562500/336196) * 25 = 14062.5

        Lara wants to make a necklace. The necklace requires (11/3) feet of yarn. She also wants to add smaller beads which will extend the length of the necklace by (8/30) feet. How many feet of materials will Lara need to make the necklace?

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The original length of the necklace is (11/3) feet. The length will be extended by (8/30) feet. To find the total length, we add the two lengths together:

(11/3) + (8/30) = (11/3) + (2/15) = (55/15) + (6/15) = (61/15) = 4.07 feet

So, Lara will need 4.07 feet of yarn to make the necklace.

Plane B travels 26/27 miles per minute, so in one minute it travels 26/27 * 1 = 26/27 miles.
The difference in distance traveled is 24/11 - 26/27 = (24*27 - 26*11) / (11*27) = 648 - 286 / 297 = 362/297.

Plane B travels 2/27 miles per minute, so in one minute it travels 2/27 * 1 = 2/27 miles.
The difference in distance traveled is 24/11 - 2/27 = (24*27 - 2*11) / (11*27) = 648 - 22 / 297 = 626/297.

        Imagine you're a music producer who is working on a new song. Your resources are divided into different sections.

- First, you dedicate 16/4 hours to composing the music and another 16/29 hours to writing the lyrics. This is your initial time investment for the song (let's call it p).

- Then, you spend 28/13 hours for mixing and mastering the song in addition to the initial time investment (let's call this new total time b).

- Suddenly, a drummer you hired for a session uses 18/4 hours less because he finished his parts quickly.

What is the final time you spent on producing the song, if your total time is expressed as (b - (18 / 4))?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, you dedicate 16/4 hours to composing the music and another 16/29 hours to writing the lyrics, which is your initial time investment (p).

p = 16/4 + 16/29
= 4 + 16/29
= 4 + 0.55 (approximately)
= 4.55 hours

Then, you spend 28/13 hours for mixing and mastering the song in addition to the initial time investment (p). This is the new total time (b).

b = p + 28/13
= 4.55 + 28/13
= 4.55 + 2.15 (approximately)
= 6.7 hours

However, the drummer uses 18/4 hours less because he finished his parts quickly. So, you subtract this from the total time (b).

b - (18/4) = 6.7 - 4.5 (approximately)
= 2.2 hours

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Monica initially has 21/15 dozens of cookies, which is equal to 21/15 * 12 = 168/15 = 11.2 dozens of cookies.
She bakes additional 29/17 dozens of cookies, which is equal to 29/17 * 12 = 174/17 = 10.2 dozens of cookies.
So, she has a total of 11.2 + 10.2 = 21.4 dozens of cookies initially.
She increases her total stock of cookies by a ratio of 7/5, which means she multiplies her total stock by 7/5 + 1 = 12/5.
So, she has a total of 21.4 * 12/5 = 51.2 dozens of cookies for the cookie festival.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Emily watched 16/4 hours of movies in total. To find the number of hours she spent watching movies other than the comedy film, we need to subtract the number of hours she spent watching the comedy film from the total number of hours.
First, we need to simplify the fraction 6/3. This can be done by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.
6/3 = 2
So, Emily spent 2 hours watching the comedy film.
Now, we can find the number of hours she spent watching movies other than the comedy film by subtracting 2 from 16/4:
16/4 - 2 = 4

To find the total number of colored pencils used for shading, we multiply the two expressions together: (20 / 11) * (23 / 26). This simplifies to (20 * 23) / (11 * 26), which is 460 / 286.

To find this, you need to add the fraction of colored pencils she uses from the previous problem to the amount of metallic pencils she uses. Evaluate this by performing the operation (8 / 6) + ((20 / 11) * (23 / 26)) and write your answer as a simplified fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the number of metallic colored pencils Marta uses in an 11-day period. This is given by the expression (8 / 6). To find the number of days in an 11-day period, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 11, which is 66. So, we can convert the expression to (8 / 6) * (11 / 11), which simplifies to (8 * 11) / (6 * 11), which is 88 / 66. Next, we need to add this to the number of colored pencils Marta uses for her art projects, which is given by the expression ((20 / 11) * (23 / 26)). We can simplify this expression as we did before, which gives us 230 / 143. Finally, we add the two expressions together: (88 / 66) + (230 / 143). To add these fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 66 and 143, which is 2466. So, we can convert the expressions to (88 * 37) / (66 * 37) and (230 * 17) / (143 * 17), which simplifies to 3256 / 2466 and 3910 / 2466, respectively. Adding these two fractions together gives us 7166 / 2466.

        A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspect’s involvement. Calculate the value of f.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the ratio of the changes, we need to find the ratio of the decrease in value per unit for each specimen.

For the first specimen, the decrease in value is 26 out of every 6 units, so the ratio is 26/6 = 13/3.

For the second specimen, the decrease in value is 25 out of every 17 units, so the ratio is 25/17.

To find the ratio of these changes, we divide the first ratio by the second ratio:

(13/3) / (25/17) = (13/3) * (17/25) = 13*17 / 3*25 = 221/75

So, the ratio of the changes is 221/75, which is indicator i.

For the second pair of evidence specimens, the increase in value is 18 out of every 8 units for the first specimen, and 17 out of every 23 units for the second specimen.

To find the difference between these two rates, we subtract the second rate from the first rate:

(18/8) - (17/23) = (18*23 - 17*8) / (8*23) = 414 - 136 / 184 = 278/184

So, the difference between the two rates is 278/184, which is indicator h.

To find the final evidence factor, we multiply indicator h by indicator i:

f = h * i = (278/184) * (221/75) = 61311/13750

The gestation period of the lioness reduces by 15/20 of a year compared to the earlier total gestation period. The earlier total gestation period is 25 4/11 months, which is equivalent to 25.36 months. The reduction in gestation period is 15/20 * 25.36 = 11.68 months.

        You have a paint mixing machine that creates specific shades of color.

The machine starts by mixing 24/8 gallons of red paint. It then pours away 12/8 gallons of the mix. Let 'd' represent the amount of red paint left in the machine.

Finally, the machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color, subtract that from 'd' to find 'x' in gallons, which is the total amount of paint. Find the value of 'x'.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

1. The machine starts by mixing 24/8 = 3 gallons of red paint.
2. It then pours away 12/8 = 1.5 gallons of the mix, leaving behind 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 gallons of red paint. Let's represent this amount as 'd'.
3. The machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color. To find the total amount of paint, we subtract this amount from 'd': 1.5 - 1/28 = 1.5 - 0.0357 (approximately) = 1.4643 gallons.

So, the value of 'x' is approximately 1.4643 gallons.

Now, suppose their mom includes an amount of toothpaste for herself to the total - she uses 3/18 oz of toothpaste daily. Add this amount to the total used by Sonia and Anthony to get the final total daily toothpaste usage for the whole family. Solve each fraction separately and give the answer as a simplified fraction.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add the fractions, we need to find the common denominator, which is 108. Then, we can add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.

Sonia uses 21/12 oz of toothpaste, which can be simplified to 7/4 oz. To convert it to the common denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 27, getting 567/108 oz.

Anthony uses 6/27 oz of toothpaste, which can be simplified to 4/27 oz. To convert it to the common denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 4, getting 16/108 oz.

The total daily amount used by Sonia and Anthony is the sum of their fractions: 567/108 + 16/108 = 583/108 oz.

Their mom uses 3/18 oz of toothpaste daily, which can be simplified to 1/6 oz. To convert it to the common denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 18, getting 18/108 oz.

        Let's suppose for a special recipe sandwich, you need to divide a wheel of cheese into 14 equal parts and a pickle jar into 18 equal parts. 

To make one special sandwich, you need 21 parts of the wheel of cheese and 7 parts from the pickle jar.

You've just made these sandwiches and you are down to ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of your original ingredients.

Later, you decided to make a simpler version of the sandwich which required half of the wheel of cheese and did not use any pickles.

What fraction of the original ingredients do you have left after making the simpler sandwich? Calculate the answer by subtracting (2 / 4) from the fraction you had after making the first sandwich.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, you had ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of the original ingredients left.

To make the simpler sandwich, you used half of the wheel of cheese, which is (21 / 2) = 10.5 parts. You didn't use any pickles, so the fraction of pickle parts used remains the same, which is 7 / 18.

You now have (1 - (10.5 / 14) - (7 / 18)) of the original ingredients left.

Simplifying the fractions, you get:

(1 - (3/4) - (7/18)) = (1 - 3/4) - (7/18)
= (1/4) - (7/18)
= (9/36) - (7/18)
= (9/36) - (14/36)
= (9 - 14)/36
= -5/36

So, you have -5/36 of the original ingredients left after making the simpler sandwich.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total height of the windows, we need to add the heights of the two windows.

The first window is 15/6 meters tall, which can be simplified to 5/2 meters tall.

The second window is 7/16 meters tall.

To add these two heights, we need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 16 is 16. So, we can convert the height of the first window to have a denominator of 16:

5/2 = 30/16

Now we can add the heights:

30/16 + 7/16 = 37/16

So, the total height of the windows is 37/16 meters.

To convert this back to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator, which gives us 1 1/12. Now, we can add the cranberry juice to get a total of 1 1/12 + 2/3. To add these fractions, we need to find the common denominator, which is 12. So, we can rewrite the fractions as 9/12 and 8/12. Then, we can add them together to get 17/12.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem:

Jeremy ordered slices of cheese that weighed 30/9 ounces in total, which means the total weight he requested is:

30/9 = 10/3 ounces

However, upon weighing, he found that there was 17/22 ounces less cheese than he requested. This means the actual weight of cheese he received is:

d = n - (17/22)

where n is the total weight he requested, which is 10/3 ounces.

Substituting the value of n into the equation, we get:

d = (10/3) - (17/22)

To simplify the equation, we can find a common denominator for both fractions:

d = (20/6) - (17/22)

= (20/6) - (51/66)

= (20/6) - (17/22) × (3/3)

= (20/6) - (51/66) × (1/3)

Now, we can simplify the fractions:

d = (20/6) - (17/22)

        Sophia is a researcher who studies sunglasses. She was examining a batch of sunglasses and trying to calculate the average light blocking efficiency.

In the first test, she found that 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays completely, while in the second test, 20 out of every 18 sunglasses also blocked all UV rays.

Sophia decided to add these numbers to her total. Next, she added the additional 21 out of 17 sunglasses from another batch that also blocked all UV rays.

Later, she realized she made a mistake and needed to subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that actually did not block all UV rays.

What is the final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays, according to Sophia's tests and calculations? Please give your answer as a simplified fraction.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down Sophia's calculations:

1. First test: 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays, so the fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 13/4.
2. Second test: 20 out of every 18 sunglasses blocked all UV rays, so the fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 20/18.
3. Third test: 21 out of every 17 sunglasses blocked all UV rays, so the fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 21/17.
4. Subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that did not block all UV rays: 16/30 = 8/15.

Now, let's add the fractions of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays from each test:

(13/4) + (20/18) + (21/17) = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 4 × 18 × 17 = 2288. Then, we can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 2288:

(13 × 579)/2288 + (20 × 127)/2288 + (21 × 136)/2288 = ?

= 7537/2288 + 2540/2288 + 2856/2288 = 13033/2288

Finally, subtract the fraction of sunglasses that did not block all UV rays:

13033/2288 - 8/15 = ?

= (13033 × 15) - (8 × 2288) / 2288 = 195495/2288 - 18464/2288 = 77131/2288

        Shawn is making sandwiches for a picnic. The recipe for the sandwiches requires different amounts of mayonnaise and sandwich spread. 

To make a sandwich, Shawn uses 23/28 cups of mayonnaise and 6/9 cups of sandwich spread. How many cups of these two ingredients does Shawn use in total to make a sandwich?

While preparing the sandwiches, Shawn realizes that he has to add 18/12 cups of cheese spread to his recipe. Calculate the total amount of ingredients Shawn now needs to make one sandwich which includes mayonnaise, sandwich spread, and cheese spread. 

Finally, if Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, how many cups of ingredients will he use in total to make those sandwiches?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step!

1. To make a sandwich, Shawn uses 23/28 cups of mayonnaise and 6/9 cups of sandwich spread. To find the total amount of these two ingredients, we need to add them:

23/28 + 6/9 = (23 × 9) / (28 × 9) + (6 × 28) / (9 × 28) = 207/252 + 168/252 = 375/252

So, Shawn uses 375/252 cups of mayonnaise and sandwich spread in total to make a sandwich.

2. Shawn realizes that he needs to add 18/12 cups of cheese spread to his recipe. To find the total amount of ingredients now, we add the cheese spread to the previous total:

375/252 + 18/12 = (375 × 12) / (252 × 12) + 18/12 = 4500/3024 + 18/12 = 4500/3024 + 36/36 = 4536/3024

So, Shawn now needs 4536/3024 cups of ingredients to make one sandwich.

3. If Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, we need to find the total amount of ingredients he'll use:

4536/3024 × 4/4 = 4536/3024 = 4536/3024

So, Shawn will use 4536/3024 cups of ingredients in total to make those sandwiches.

        Cassandra collected keys for a hobby. At first she had a collection equivalent to 7/6 of a key set. After she lost 1/21 of a key set, how many key sets does she have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Cassandra initially had 7/6 of a key set. To find the number of key sets, we can multiply this fraction by 6/7, which gives us 1 key set. So, she had 1 key set initially.
After losing 1/21 of a key set, she lost 1/21 * 1 = 1/21 key sets. To find the number of key sets she has now, we subtract this from the initial number of key sets: 1 - 1/21 = 20/21.

        A songwriter is composing a new piece. In the first section, he uses a ratio of 29 notes every 23 measures. In the second section, he uses a ratio of 19 notes every 17 measures. 

Calculate the difference between the sum of the ratios of the two sections ((29 / 23) + (19 / 17)) and the ratio of a rest, which is equivalent to one whole measure (26/26), used in the third section of his composition.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To calculate the sum of the ratios of the two sections, we need to simplify each fraction:

(29/23) = 1.26 (approximately)
(19/17) = 1.12 (approximately)

Adding these two fractions, we get:

1.26 + 1.12 = 2.38

Now, we need to simplify the ratio of the rest, which is equivalent to one whole measure:

(26/26) = 1

To find the difference between the sum of the ratios and the ratio of the rest, we subtract:

2.38 - 1 = 1.38

        You're trying to solve a puzzle that requires you to multiply two fractions together. The fractions are 22/25 and 22/8. Calculate the product to get the answer you need to advance in the puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply two fractions together, we multiply the numerators (the numbers on top) and multiply the denominators (the numbers on the bottom), and then simplify the resulting fraction.

So, we multiply:

(22/25) × (22/8) = ?

First, we multiply the numerators:
22 × 22 = 484

Next, we multiply the denominators:
25 × 8 = 200

Now, we write the product as a fraction:
484/200

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.

484 ÷ 4 = 121
200 ÷ 4 = 50

So, the simplified product is:
121/50

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously found that the product of the two fractions is 121/50.

Now, we need to add the result from the step we just completed to the number on the key, which is 23/13.

To add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 50 and 13 is 650. So, we can rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 650:

121/50 = 303/650
23/13 = 230/650

Now, we can add the two fractions:

303/650 + 230/650 = 533/650

        Previously, you multiplied fractions 22/25 and 22/8 in the first part of the puzzle. Suppose instead of the 22/25 that you initially saw, the actual fraction in the text was 13/25. Now, you wonder how this change in information might affect your product. Recalculate the result using the correct fractions, which are now 13/25 and 22/8. What is the new product of these fractions?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's recalculate the product using the new fractions:

(13/25) × (22/8) = ?

First, we multiply the numerators:
13 × 22 = 286

Next, we multiply the denominators:
25 × 8 = 200

Now, we write the product as a fraction:
286/200

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

286 ÷ 2 = 143
200 ÷ 2 = 100

So, the simplified product is:
143/100

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the total length of the pillow. The pillow is 23/9 feet long, and there is an additional 22/25 feet due to the fluffing of the pillow. So, the total length is 23/9 + 22/25 = &lt;&lt;(23*25)/(9*25) + 22/25 = (575+22)/25 = 597/25 = 23.88&gt;&gt;23.88 feet.

Next, we need to multiply this total length by 16/13 to account for overlap and corners. So, the length of border material James will need is 23.88 * 16/13 = &lt;&lt;23.88*16/13 = 384.768/13 = 29.57&gt;&gt;29.57 feet.

How many more miles was the car supposed to travel in total that day, given that it ran continuously at the same speed? Calculate by multiplying the additional distance needed by the average miles the car travels in an hour.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The car was supposed to travel an extra 16/13 miles, but it only traveled an additional 1/21 miles. So, the car was supposed to travel 16/13 - 1/21 = &lt;&lt;(16/13)-(1/21)=(16*21-13*1)/(13*21)=(336-182)/273=154/273&gt;&gt;154/273 miles more.

The car travels 21/4 miles every hour. So, it travels 21/4 * 1 = &lt;&lt;21/4*1=5.25&gt;&gt;5.25 miles in an hour. To find the total distance it was supposed to travel, we multiply the additional distance needed by the average miles the car travels in an hour: 154/273 * 5.25 = &lt;&lt;154/273*5.25=40.5&gt;&gt;40.5 miles.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The initial time required for the editing team is 20/5 hours, and for the typesetting team is 18/17 hours. The total initial time required is the sum of these two times, which is (20/5) + (18/17) = 4 + 1.06 = 5.06 hours.

The collective loss of time is 6/15 hours. To compensate for this loss, the manager extended the working hours by the same amount of time as the initial time span of the process, which is 5.06 hours. Therefore, the extended time is 5.06 + 5.06 = 10.12 hours.

        Heather was preparing a special three-course dinner for her family. 

For the first course, she had a bread recipe that required 11/17 of a cup of sugar. In addition, she baked a custard for dessert that required another 6/2 cups of sugar. 

As her family loves sweet dishes, she decided to increase the total quantity of sugar by a factor of 29/21. How many cups of sugar did Heather use in total?

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the total amount of sugar required for the first course and the custard. For the first course, it is 11/17 cups. For the custard, it is 6/2 = 3 cups. So, the total amount of sugar required is 11/17 + 3 = 40/17 cups.

Next, we need to increase the total amount of sugar by a factor of 29/21. To do this, we multiply the total amount of sugar by 29/21. This gives us (40/17) * (29/21) = 40/17 * 29/21 = 40/17 * 29/21 = 40 * 29 / (17 * 21) = 40 * 29 / 357 = 1160/357.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate the expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 7 by 8: 7/8 = 0.875
2. Divide 21 by 18: 21/18 = 1.1666... (approximately)
3. Add the two results: 0.875 + 1.1666... = 2.0416... (approximately)

To simplify the result, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator:

        Teddy is a bear who loves to play with numbers. One day, Teddy was playing with his favorite number, which just so happened to be 30/17. While playing, he saw another number, 18/15, and decided to add it to his favorite number. With this new number in mind, he then saw another, 24/13, and decided to multiply it by his new number. What is Teddy's final number?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, Teddy adds 18/15 to his favorite number, 30/17. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So, we can rewrite the fractions as 30/17 = 90/15 and 18/15 = 18/15. Now, we can add them: 90/15 + 18/15 = 108/15.
Next, Teddy multiplies 108/15 by 24/13. To multiply these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 195. So, we can rewrite the fractions as 108/15 = 216/195 and 24/13 = 120/195. Now, we can multiply them: 216/195 * 120/195 = 25920/38225.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The time taken to assemble the first model is 17/10 hours. The time taken to assemble the second model is 12/23 hours. To find the difference, subtract the time taken for the second model from the time taken for the first model:

(17/10) - (12/23) = (17/10) - (12/23) = (17/10) * (23/23) - (12/23) * (10/10) = (391/230) - (120/230) = (271/230)

To simplify the fraction, divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 23:

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The car's initial speed was 13/4 miles per minute.
The car slows down by 14/15 miles per minute, so the new speed is:
13/4 - 14/15 = (13/4) - (14/15) = (15/60) - (14/15) = (1/60) = 1/60 miles per minute
The car's new speed is 13/4 - 14/15 = 1/60 miles per minute.
The car increases its speed by 30/15 miles per minute, so the final speed is:

- But Jake isn't the only one interested in these grapes. He has to share the grapes with others. He gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes. How many baskets of grapes does he get?

- Out of the grapes that he got, Jake wants to make some grape juice. But he only uses 9/10 of his grapes to make the juice. How many baskets of grapes does he use for the juice?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step!

1. The vineyard usually produces 19/2 baskets of grapes every season, but this season they produced only 19/29 of the usual amount. To find the actual number of baskets produced this season, we can multiply the usual amount by the fraction of the usual amount that was produced:

19/2 × 19/29 = 19 × 19 / (2 × 29) = 361/58 ≈ 6.22

So, the vineyard produced approximately 6.22 baskets of grapes this season.

2. Jake gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes. To find the number of baskets he gets, we can multiply the total amount by the fraction he gets:

6.22 × 7/11 ≈ 3.45

So, Jake gets approximately 3.45 baskets of grapes.

3. Jake wants to make grape juice using 9/10 of his grapes. To find the number of baskets he uses for the juice, we can multiply the number of baskets he gets by the fraction he uses:

3.45 × 9/10 ≈ 3.11

So, Jake uses approximately 3.11 baskets of grapes to make the juice.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total number of bushels of grapes, we need to add the number of bushels of red grapes and the number of bushels of green grapes.

First, we need to simplify the fractions:

9/2 = 4.5 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2)
10/22 = 0.5 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2)

Now, we can add the simplified fractions:

4.5 + 0.5 = 5

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The child splits the sand into 24/7 = 3.428571 parts (approximately). This means each part is 1/3.428571 of the total sand.
The other child takes away 2/16 part of the sand. To find the fraction of the total sand taken away, we need to convert 2/16 to a decimal: 2/16 = 0.125.
Now, we subtract the fraction taken away from the total number of parts: 1 - 0.125 = 0.875.
Since each part is 1/3.428571 of the total sand, we multiply the remaining fraction by the total number of parts: 0.875 * 3.428571 = 3.

Teddy hides 18/11 of his friends in the forest and 8/21 of his friends at the beach. First calculate how many more friends Teddy hides in the forest than at the beach. Let's call this number 'f'. Then square 'f' to find 'n', the total number of hiding spots Teddy needs. How many hiding spots does Teddy need?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the number of friends Teddy hides in the forest and at the beach. To do this, we need to simplify the fractions:

18/11 = 1 7/11
8/21 = 0 8/21

So, Teddy hides 1 7/11 of his friends in the forest and 0 8/21 of his friends at the beach. Since 0 8/21 is less than 1 7/11, Teddy hides more friends in the forest than at the beach. To find the difference, we subtract:

1 7/11 - 0 8/21 = 1 7/11 - 0 = 1 7/11

So, 'f' is 1 7/11. To square 'f', we need to square the whole number part (1) and the fractional part (7/11) separately:

(1)^2 = 1
(7/11)^2 = (7^2)/(11^2) = 49/121

Now, we add the squared whole number part and the squared fractional part:

1 + 49/121 = 50/121 + 49/121 = 99/121

So, 'n' is 99/121.</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add 2/10 and 21/4, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 4 is 20. So, we can rewrite 2/10 as 4/20 and 21/4 as 21/4.
Now, we can add 4/20 and 21/4:
4/20 + 21/4 = 4/20 + 42/20 = 46/20
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
46/20 = 23/10

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total hours of power, we need to multiply the fraction of filled fuel tanks by the hours each tank can power the spacecraft.

First, we simplify the fractions: (18/30) = 3/5 and (22/6) = 11/3

Then, we multiply the simplified fractions: (3/5) * (11/3) = 11/15

So, the spacecraft currently has 11/15 hours of power.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, let's calculate the fraction of the pile the monkey eats: (22 / 7) times (10 / 25) = (22/7) × (10/25) = (220/175) = 4/5.
So, the monkey eats 4/5 of the pile, which means he has 1/5 of the pile left.
Then, he gives 3/28 of the pile to his friend, which is less than 1/5. So, the monkey has 1/5 - 3/28 = (28/140) - (21/140) = 7/140 of the pile left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Tilly initially has 25/9 kg of sea plants.
She finds 8/13 kg more, so she now has 25/9 + 8/13 kg = 25/9 * 13/13 + 8/13 = 325/117 + 8/13 = 325/117 + 104/117 = 429/117 kg.
She then finds 24/27 kg, so she now has 429/117 + 24/27 kg = 429/117 * 27/27 + 24/27 = 429/117 + 8/9 = 429/117 + 104/117 = 533/117 kg.
Finally, she finds 21/26 kg, so she now has 533/117 + 21/26 kg = 533/117 * 26/26 + 21/26 = 533/117 + 7/13 = 533/117 + 91/117 = 624/117 kg.

        Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements. 

What does Captain Alf’s final calculation come to? Use these steps and corresponding fractions to find your answer.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Step 1: Calculate the difference in Captain Alf's current location and the distance to the island.

Current distance = 4/2 nautical miles
Distance to the island = 17/2 nautical miles
Difference = Distance to the island - Current distance
= (17/2) - (4/2)
= (17 - 4)/2
= 13/2
= 6.5 nautical miles

Step 2: Adjust for the tide.

Adjusted distance = Difference + Tide
= 6.5 + (14/9)
= 6.5 + 1.5555555555555556
= 8.055555555555555

Step 3: Calculate the fuel requirements.

Fuel requirements = Adjusted distance / Fuel efficiency
= 8.055555555555555 / (22/15)
= 8.055555555555555 / 1.466666666666667
= 5.5 nautical miles per gallon

(4/26) + (15/11) + (23/28) + (8/19)

To add these fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is 2280. Then, we can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 2280:

(96/2280) + (1350/2280) + (1035/2280) + (912/2280)

Adding these fractions, we get:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Oliver has a kite string that is 26/19 meters long and another kite string that is 7/11 meters long. He adds these two strings to create an even longer kite string.
The combined length of the kite strings is 26/19 + 7/11 = &lt;&lt;(26/19) + (7/11)&gt;&gt;.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 209. So, we can rewrite the fractions as 26/19 = 130/209 and 7/11 = 91/209.
Now, we can add the fractions: 130/209 + 91/209 = 221/209.
Oliver decides to use only 5/8 of this combined string. To find 5/8 of 221/209, we multiply the numerator and denominator of 221/209 by 5 and then divide the numerator by 8.
So, 5/8 of 221/209 is (5*221)/(8*209) = 1105/1668.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To solve the equation u = 9/19 + 6/8, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 19 and 8 is 152. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

u = (9*8)/((19*8)) + (19*6)/(19*8)
u = 72/152 + 114/152
u = 186/152
u = 93/76

Now, we can substitute this value of u into the second equation:

j = 93/76 + 4/1
j = 93/76 + 4*76/1*76
j = 93/76 + 376/76
j = 469/76

        Debra is baking cookies and she realizes she has two different recipes for the same type of cookie. She's wondering if she combines the ingredients from both, if she will end up with even more cookies or not. 

The first recipe requires (27 / 3) cups flour and (11 / 7) cups sugar. She determines the ratio of flour to sugar by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar. She then subtracts (21 / 26) from this ratio because that's how many cups of sugar her friend says makes the cookies too sweet. After that, she adds (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio to see how many total cups of flour she will need. How many cups of flour will she have in the end?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the ratio of flour to sugar in the first recipe. We can do this by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar:

(27 / 3) / (11 / 7) = (27 / 3) * (7 / 11) = 63 / 33 = 1.909

Now, we subtract (21 / 26) from this ratio:

1.909 - (21 / 26) = 1.909 - 0.808 = 1.101

Next, we add (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio:

1.101 + (22 / 9) = 1.101 + 2.444 = 3.545

So, Debra will need 3.545 cups of flour in the end.

        There are 26/13 chickens in one farm and 9/16 chickens in another farm. Farmer John calculated the difference between the number of chickens in the two farms. After a week, the number of chickens multiplied by 19/21 due to new chickens born. How many chickens are there now in Farmer John's farm?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the difference between the number of chickens in the two farms. The number of chickens in the first farm is 26/13, and the number of chickens in the second farm is 9/16. To find the difference, we subtract the two numbers:

(26/13) - (9/16) = (26*16 - 9*13) / (13*16) = (416 - 117) / 208 = 299 / 208

So, the difference between the number of chickens in the two farms is 299/208.

After a week, the number of chickens in the farms multiplied by 19/21. To find the new number of chickens, we multiply the original number of chickens by 19/21:

(26/13 + 299/208) * (19/21) = ((26*21 + 299*13) / (13*21)) * (19/21) = ((546 + 3907) / 273) * (19/21) = (4453 / 273) * (19/21) = 163 / 9

So, there are now 163/9 chickens in Farmer John's farm.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The helicopter flew 24/14 miles for the first exercise, and the same distance for the second exercise. So, w = 24/14.
The total distance flown for both exercises is represented as the product of 'w' times 'w', which is w*w = (24/14)*(24/14).
To find the value of 't', we can simplify the expression:

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The UFO filled 20/16 of its tank during the first refuel, which is equivalent to 5/4 of its tank.
The UFO filled 24/25 of its tank during the second refuel.
To find the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill, we add the fractions: 5/4 + 24/25.
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 100. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 100:
5/4 = 25/40
24/25 = 96/100
