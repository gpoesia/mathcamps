        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of rooms above the ground floor is x. We know that the total number of rooms in the house is 18, and there are 5 rooms on the ground floor. So, we can set up the equation:

5 + x = 18

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

x = 18 - 5
x = 13

So, there are 13 rooms above the ground floor.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found that there are 13 rooms above the ground floor. Since there are 5 rooms on the ground floor, we can add the basement to the count. Let's say the number of rooms in the basement is y. Then, the total number of rooms in the house is:

5 (ground floor) + 13 (above ground floor) + y (basement) = 18

We can simplify the equation by combining the rooms above the ground floor:

5 + 13 + y = 18

Combine like terms:

18 + y = 18

Subtract 18 from both sides:

y = 0

So, there are 0 rooms in the basement. This makes sense, as a basement is typically not considered a room. However, if we count the basement as a room, then we can include it in the count.

The total number of rooms above the ground floor or in the basement is:

5 (ground floor) + 13 (above ground floor) = 18

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The baby T-Rex has 6 teeth now.
An adult T-Rex has 11 teeth.
To find out how many more teeth the baby T-Rex needs to grow, subtract the number of teeth it has now from the number of teeth an adult T-Rex has: 11 - 6 = 5.
