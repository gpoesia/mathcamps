        Julian is cutting sections of rope for a project. Each section is 13/2 feet long. He is only able to use 5/7 of each section. How many feet are in the usable part of each section of rope? Calculate this by multiplying 13/2 by 5/7.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the usable part of each section, we need to multiply the length of each section (13/2) by the fraction of the section that is usable (5/7).

First, we can simplify the fraction 5/7 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. This leaves us with the same fraction.

Next, we can multiply the two fractions:

(13/2) × (5/7) = (13 × 5) / (2 × 7) = 65/14

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. This leaves us with the same fraction.

Therefore, the usable part of each section of rope is 65/14 feet.

First, we can simplify the fraction 5/7 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. This leaves us with the same fraction.

Next, we can multiply the two fractions:

(17/2) × (5/7) = (17 × 5) / (2 × 7) = 85/14

(7 × 12) / (16 × 1) = 84 / 16

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

1. Divide 17 by 18: 17 ÷ 18 = 0.94 (approximately)
2. Divide 13 by 8: 13 ÷ 8 = 1.625 (approximately)
3. Multiply the results: 0.94 × 1.625 = 1.5275 (approximately)

To simplify the fraction, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator:

1. Find the GCD of 1.5275 and 1: The GCD is 1, since 1 is the only number that divides both 1.5275 and 1.
2. Write the simplified fraction: 1.5275 = 1 527/1000 = 153/100 = 0.153

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total number of meters of thread, we need to multiply the number of meters of thread per piece of fabric by the number of pieces of fabric.

The number of meters of thread per piece of fabric is 2/19, and we have 20 pieces of fabric. To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator by the whole number and keep the denominator the same:

(2/19) × 20 = (2 × 20) / 19 = 40/19

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The formula s = (16 * (5 / 12)) represents the total amount of flour needed, where s is the total amount of flour and 16 is the number of cakes, 5/12 is the amount of flour needed for each cake.

To evaluate the expression, we can follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 5 by 12: 5/12 = 0.4166666666666667
2. Multiply 16 by the result: 16 * 0.4166666666666667 = 6.666666666666667

So, the baker will need approximately 6.67 kilograms of flour.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Tom has 13 boxes and each of his friends will get 12/13 of a box. To find the total number of boxes his friends will receive, we can multiply the number of friends by the amount each friend will get:

Number of friends = unknown (let's call it x)
Amount each friend will get = 12/13 of a box

Total boxes his friends will receive = x × (12/13)

Since Tom has 48 friends, we can substitute x = 48:

Total boxes his friends will receive = 48 × (12/13)

To simplify the fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 13:

Total boxes his friends will receive = 48 × (12 × 13)/(13 × 13)
= 48 × 12/13
= 576/13
= 44 + 8/13

So, Tom's friends will receive 44 whole boxes and 8/13 of a box.

Then, we multiply 22 by the denominator 19:

22 × 19 = 418

Now, we divide 418 by the numerator 2:

So, the result of multiplying 11 by the fraction 2/19 is 209.

        After finding the result of multiplying twelve divided by twelve with the whole number sixteen, what is the new result when that value is further multiplied by four divided by fourteen?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found that multiplying twelve divided by twelve with the whole number sixteen gives 16.
Multiplying 16 by four divided by fourteen is the same as multiplying 16 by 4/14.
To simplify the fraction 4/14, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives us 2/7.
So, multiplying 16 by 2/7 is the same as multiplying 16 by 2 and then dividing by 7, which gives 32/7.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of clay needed, we need to multiply the amount of clay per model by the number of models.

The amount of clay per model is 8/7 pounds, and the number of models is 17/3.

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (8 and 17) and multiply the denominators (7 and 3), then simplify the resulting fraction.

8/7 × 17/3 = (8 × 17) / (7 × 3) = 136/21

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step!

The formula is: p = 5 * (14 / 16)

First, let's simplify the fraction inside the parentheses:

14 / 16 = 7/8

Now, multiply 5 by the simplified fraction:

p = 5 * (7/8)

To multiply a whole number by a fraction, we multiply the whole number by the numerator (7) and then divide by the denominator (8):

p = (5 * 7) / 8

p = 35 / 8

To find the number of scoops needed, we need to convert the decimal to a whole number. Since 35 is greater than 32, we know that the decimal part is greater than 0.5. Therefore, we round up to the nearest whole number:

p = 4.375 → 5

So, you need 5 scoops to have 5 whole cups of flour.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To triple the recipe, we need to multiply the required amount of sugar by 3.

First, we simplify the fraction 9/10 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

So, 9/10 = 9/10

Now, we multiply 9/10 by 3:

(9/10) * 3 = (9 * 3) / 10 = 27/10

To simplify the fraction 27/10, we divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

So, 27/10 = 27/10

So, 9/17 = 9/17

Now, we multiply 9/17 by 3:

(9/17) * 3 = (9 * 3) / 17 = 27/17

To simplify the fraction 27/17, we divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

So, 27/17 = 27/17

Since the denominator is 17, which is not equal to 1 cup, we cannot simplify the fraction further. Therefore, William will need 27/17 cups of sugar, which is equal to 1.5882 cups (rounded to four decimal places).

The new grape juice is 15/6 more concentrated than the original one. This means that if he uses the same amount of new grape juice as the original recipe, the resulting mixture will be 15/6 times more concentrated than the original recipe. To adjust for this, he needs to reduce the amount of new grape juice by a factor of 15/6.

To find the correct ratio, we can multiply the two factors together: (12/16) * (15/6) = 15/16.

        If the baker decides to make a smaller cake that only uses 6/18 of the original amount of flour, how many pounds of flour would the baker use for the smaller cake?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The original amount of flour is 9 pounds. The baker is using 6/18 of the original amount, which is equivalent to 1/3 of the original amount. To find the weight of flour used for the smaller cake, we multiply the original weight by the fraction:

9 pounds x (1/3) = 9 pounds x 0.3333... = 3 pounds

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the amount of flour needed for the portion of the recipe, we need to multiply the required amount of flour by the fraction of the recipe being made.

The required amount of flour is 12/8 cups, and the fraction of the recipe being made is 9/13. To multiply these two values, we can multiply the numerator of the required amount by the numerator of the fraction being made, and then multiply the denominator of the required amount by the denominator of the fraction being made.

(12/8) × (9/13) = (12 × 9) / (8 × 13) = 108/104

So, Julia needs 108/104 cups of flour for the portion of the recipe she is making.

        Let's modify the previous problem slightly. If instead of (18 / 18), you used (9 / 18), what would be the product of this fraction and (11 / 5)? Report your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To calculate the product of the two fractions, we multiply the numerators (9 and 11) and multiply the denominators (18 and 5), then simplify the resulting fraction.

Product = (9/18) × (11/5) = (9 × 11) / (18 × 5) = 99 / 90

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9.

99 ÷ 9 = 11
90 ÷ 9 = 10

So, the simplified fraction is:

99 / 90 = 11 / 10

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.

To do this, we multiply 12 by the numerator of the fraction, which is 3, and keep the denominator the same.

12 × 3 = 36

So, the result is the fraction 36/15.

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

36 ÷ 3 = 12
15 ÷ 3 = 5

So, the simplified result is 12/5.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We multiply the result (19) by the fraction 6/10.

19 × (6/10) = (19 × 6) / 10 = 114 / 10

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

114 ÷ 2 = 57
10 ÷ 2 = 5

So, the simplified result is:

114 / 10 = 57/5

We can further simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

57 ÷ 1 = 57
5 ÷ 1 = 5

So, the final simplified result is:

57/5 = 11.4

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: When multiplying a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator by the whole number and keep the denominator the same.

So, multiplying 15/15 by 20, we get:

(15/15) × 20 = (15 × 20) / 15 = 300 / 15

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15.

300 ÷ 15 = 20
15 ÷ 15 = 1

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Mary has 16 apples and shares 3/5 of them with her friends. To find the number of apples she shares, we can multiply 16 by 3/5.
16 * (3/5) = 16 * 0.6 = 9.6
Since we can't share a fraction of an apple, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mary shares 9 apples with her friends.

        Your pet dog, Bear, can chase and bring back the ball twice every minute during your playtime. After playing for 6 minutes, how many times did Bear bring the ball back? 

This can be represented by 2*6. 

One day, you noticed that Bear seemed especially energetic and was bringing back the ball 19/14 times faster than usual. Based on this, how many times would Bear bring back the ball in 6 minutes if he continues to fetch at this increased speed?

This can be represented by (19/14) * (2*6). Calculate and write your answer as a simplified fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's calculate how many times Bear brought the ball back in 6 minutes at his usual speed:

2 × 6 = 12

So, Bear brought the ball back 12 times in 6 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how many times Bear would bring the ball back in 6 minutes if he continues to fetch at the increased speed:

(19/14) × (2 × 6) = (19/14) × 12 = (228/14) = 16 2/7

        The previous problem was about Bear bringing back the ball twice every minute while playing for 6 minutes. 

Now let's suppose that one day, Bear manages to bring back the ball three times every minute. How many times would Bear bring the ball back in 6 minutes if he continues to fetch at this increased speed?

This can be represented by 3 * 6. Calculate the product.

        What is the result when 5/14 of a whole is multiplied by 18?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the result, we need to multiply 5/14 by 18.

First, we can simplify the fraction 5/14 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. So, the fraction remains the same.

Then, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 18 to get:

(5/14) × 18 = (5 × 18)/(14 × 18) = 90/252

We can simplify the fraction 90/252 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 18. So, the fraction becomes:

90/252 = 5/14

Therefore, the result of multiplying 5/14 by 18 is 5/14.
