        The child then finds another huge stash of toy trucks totalling 2925. He continues to distribute them evenly among his 18 stuffed animals. How many additional toy trucks does each stuffed animal get now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The child already distributed 36 toy trucks evenly among his 18 stuffed animals, so each stuffed animal got 2 toy trucks initially.

Now, he has 2925 additional toy trucks to distribute. To find out how many toy trucks each stuffed animal gets, we need to divide the total number of additional toy trucks (2925) by the number of stuffed animals (18).

2925 ÷ 18 = 162.5

Since we can't divide toy trucks into fractions, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Each stuffed animal gets 162 additional toy trucks.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the distance the tiger walked in one minute, we need to divide the total distance (2556 meters) by the total time (36 minutes).

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

36 minutes = 36/60 = 0.6 hours

Now, we can divide the total distance by the total time:

2556 meters / 0.6 hours = 4252 meters per hour

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to meters per minute:

        An unidentified flying object (UFO) traveled a distance of 1278 miles in 71 minutes. Assuming the UFO traveled at a constant speed, what was the UFO's speed in miles per minute?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the UFO's speed, we need to divide the distance traveled (1278 miles) by the time taken (71 minutes).

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

71 minutes = 71/60 = 1.18 hours

Now, we can calculate the UFO's speed:

Speed = Distance / Time = 1278 miles / 1.18 hours = 1080 miles per hour

To find the speed in miles per minute, we can divide the speed in miles per hour by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

1080 miles per hour ÷ 60 = 18 miles per minute

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know the distance traveled is the same (1278 miles), but the time taken is different (218 minutes). To find the UFO's speed, we need to divide the distance traveled by the new time taken.

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

218 minutes = 218/60 = 3.63 hours

Now, we can calculate the UFO's speed:

Speed = Distance / Time = 1278 miles / 3.63 hours = 352 miles per hour

To find the speed in miles per minute, we can divide the speed in miles per hour by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

352 miles per hour ÷ 60 = 5.87 miles per minute

To divide 960 by 80, we can divide 960 by 10 first, which gives us 96, and then multiply the result by 8, which gives us:

96 × 8 = 768

So, we can subtract 768 from 960 to find the remainder:

960 - 768 = 192

Since we can't divide 192 by 80, we'll carry the remainder to the next calculation.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The toy shop already had 3306 doll clothes, and now they produced an additional 9115 doll clothes. The total number of doll clothes is:

3306 + 9115 = 12421

They distributed these clothes evenly among the same 58 dolls. To find out how many pieces of clothing each doll got, we need to divide the total number of doll clothes by the number of dolls:

12421 ÷ 58 = 213.5

        A jeweler has 1944 pieces of beads and wants to create bracelets using an equal number of beads in each bracelet. If the jeweler ends up making 72 bracelets, how many beads does each bracelet have?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of beads in each bracelet, we need to divide the total number of beads (1944) by the number of bracelets (72).

1944 ÷ 72 = 27

So, each bracelet has 27 beads.

        If the jeweler decided instead to make 495 bracelets using the same 1944 beads, how many beads would each bracelet have then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of beads in each bracelet, we need to divide the total number of beads (1944) by the new number of bracelets (495).

1944 ÷ 495 = 3.93

Since you can't have a fraction of a bead, we round down to the nearest whole number.

3.93 ≈ 3

So, each bracelet would have 3 beads.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how much each person has to contribute, we need to divide the total cost of the binoculars by the number of people in the group.

Total cost = $702

        After the birdwatching group purchased the binoculars, they found a different pair costing $446 and decided to return the previous set to buy the cheaper set. If the cost is divided equally amongst the 54 people again, how much does each person have to pay now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the group is returning the previous pair and buying a new one, they will only need to pay the difference in cost.

Cost of new pair = $446
Cost of old pair = $702
Difference in cost = $702 - $446 = $256

The group will need to pay the difference in cost, which is $256. Since there are 54 people in the group, each person's contribution will be:

Contribution per person = Difference in cost ÷ Number of people
= $256 ÷ 54
= $4.74

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the boat only has 100 liters of fuel, it will run out of fuel before completing the 51-hour journey. Let's find the time it takes for the boat to consume 100 liters of fuel.

100 liters / 4 liters per hour = 25 hours

The boat will run out of fuel after 25 hours. Since the journey is 51 hours, the boat will consume fuel at a rate of:

100 liters / 25 hours = 4 liters per hour (for the first 25 hours)

After 25 hours, the boat will have no fuel left, and it will not consume any more fuel. Therefore, the rate of fuel consumption for the remaining 26 hours (51 - 25 = 26) is 0 liters per hour.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total number of socks produced is 4055 pairs. Since each pair has 2 socks, the total number of socks is 4055 * 2 = 8110 socks.
Since they produced the same number of socks each day, we can divide the total number of socks by the number of days to find the number of socks produced daily. 8110 socks / 74 days = 109.59 socks per day.
Since each pair has 2 socks, the number of pairs produced daily is 109.59 socks / 2 = 54.79 pairs per day.

        A toy factory makes 364 toys in a week. If the factory operates the same number of hours each day for 4 days a week, how many toys are made per day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The factory makes 364 toys in a week, which is 7 days. To find the number of toys made per day, we can divide the total number of toys by the number of days: 364 ÷ 7 = 52.
However, the problem states that the factory operates the same number of hours each day for 4 days a week. This means that the number of toys made per day is not necessarily equal to the total number of toys divided by the number of days. Instead, we need to find the number of toys made per day for the 4 days the factory operates.

Let's call the number of toys made per day &quot;x&quot;. Then, the total number of toys made in 4 days is 4x. We know that the total number of toys made in a week is 364, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 364

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 364 ÷ 4
x = 91

So, the factory makes 91 toys per day for the 4 days it operates.

        Now imagine the mountain's height is adjusted to 8729 meters and it still has the same 47 equally tall layers of rock. How tall would each layer of rock be in this scenario?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the number of layers remains the same (47), we can still divide the new total height of the mountain (8729 meters) by the same number of layers to find the height of each layer.

8729 ÷ 47 = 186

So, each layer of rock would be 186 meters tall in this scenario.

        A 4230 meter long rope gets divided evenly into 90 pieces. How long is each piece of rope?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the length of each piece, we need to divide the total length of the rope (4230 meters) by the number of pieces (90).

4230 ÷ 90 = ?

To divide a number by another, we can think of it as multiplying the first number by the reciprocal of the second number. In this case, the reciprocal of 90 is 1/90.

4230 × (1/90) = ?

To multiply a number by a fraction, we multiply the number by the numerator (1) and then divide by the denominator (90).

4230 × 1 = 4230
4230 ÷ 90 = 47

So, each piece of rope is 47 meters long.

        If the child decided to make a different giant snowball, this time using a total of 3327 cubic feet of snow, and again divides it to make 16 smaller snowballs, what would be the volume of each smaller snowball in cubic feet?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total volume of the snow is 3327 cubic feet. If the child makes 16 smaller snowballs with the same amount of snow, the volume of each smaller snowball is the total volume divided by the number of snowballs.

3327 ÷ 16 = &lt;&lt;3327/16=208.125&gt;&gt;208.125 cubic feet

### Answer: 208.125</pre>

        A slide is 728 inches long and has evenly spaced waves every 56 inches. How many waves are there on the slide?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of waves, we need to divide the total length of the slide (728 inches) by the distance between each wave (56 inches).

Number of waves = Total length of slide ÷ Distance between each wave
= 728 inches ÷ 56 inches
= 13

### Answer: 13</pre>

        The slide in the amusement park is being redesigned, and its new length is 3769 inches. The waves are still placed every 56 inches. How many waves will the redesigned slide have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the distance between each wave remains the same (56 inches), we can use the same formula to find the number of waves on the redesigned slide:

Number of waves = Total length of slide ÷ Distance between each wave
= 3769 inches ÷ 56 inches
= 67

### Answer: 67</pre>
