Since he has 236 sleeping bags, but expected to have 832, we subtract the number of sleeping bags he has from the expected total to find the number of sleeping bags missing: 832 - 236 = &lt;&lt;832-236=596&gt;&gt;.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step!

Initially, you had $511 in your wallet.

After buying a gift, you have $378 less, which means you have spent $511 - $378 = $133.

To find out how much money you have left, subtract the amount you spent from the initial amount:

$511 - $133 = $378

So, you have $378 left in your wallet.

        After reconsidering, Kevin realized he only used 481 stickers instead of 828. Now, if we consider this new count, how many skateboard stickers does Kevin have left after decorating his board?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Kevin started with 991 stickers and used up 481 stickers. To find out how many stickers he has left, we subtract the number of stickers used from the total number of stickers he started with.

991 - 481 = 510

So, Kevin has 510 skateboard stickers left now.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total number of mice, we need to add the number of white mice and the number of brown mice.

Number of white mice = 312
Number of brown mice = 403

Total number of mice = Number of white mice + Number of brown mice

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the total number of mice before the shipment arrived.

Number of white mice = 312
Number of brown mice = 403

Total number of mice before shipment = Number of white mice + Number of brown mice
= 312 + 403
= 715

Then, the pet store received a shipment of 268 more brown mice, so the new total number of brown mice is:

New number of brown mice = 403 + 268
= 671

Now, we need to add the number of white mice and the new number of brown mice to find the total number of mice:

Total number of mice now = Number of white mice + New number of brown mice
= 312 + 671
= 983

        At the local circus, there are 120 clowns performing in the afternoon show. In the evening show, there are 350 clowns performing. After the first day, however, 361 clowns had to leave due to other commitments. How many clowns are left to perform for the remaining days at the circus?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The number of clowns performing in the afternoon show is 120.
The number of clowns performing in the evening show is 350.
The total number of clowns performing is 120 + 350 = 470.
After 361 clowns leave, the number of clowns left is 470 - 361 = 109.

However, let's consider what would happen if there were actually 173 clowns in the afternoon show instead of 120. The number of clowns in the evening show remains the same, that is, 350. How many clowns would be performing in total for the day at the circus under this new scenario?

To find out how many blocks he has left, we subtract the number of blocks used from the total number of blocks: 438 - 368 = 70.

        A baby was receiving 658 milliliters of milk each day. One day, the baby's pediatrician advised to increase the milk intake by 18 milliliters. How much milk is the baby receiving after the increase?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The baby was receiving 658 milliliters of milk initially. The pediatrician advised to increase the milk intake by 18 milliliters. To find the new amount of milk, we add the initial amount to the increase:

658 + 18 = 676

So, the baby is receiving 676 milliliters of milk after the increase.

        A baby was receiving 658 milliliters of milk each day. One day, the baby's pediatrician advised to increase the milk intake by 18 milliliters. How much milk is the baby receiving after the increase? 

Now, consider that the baby also needs to consume 67 milliliters of water daily in addition to the milk she is receiving. How much total liquid - milk and water - is the baby consuming every day now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already calculated that the baby is receiving 676 milliliters of milk after the increase. To find the total liquid consumption, we add the milk to the water:

676 (milk) + 67 (water) = 743

So, the baby is consuming a total of 743 milliliters of liquid (milk and water) every day now.

        In the previous scenario, the baby was receiving 658 milliliters of milk each day. But let's consider a different situation. Suppose that the baby was initially receiving 380 milliliters of milk each day. If the baby's pediatrician still advised to increase the milk intake by 18 milliliters, how much milk is the baby receiving daily in this new situation?

So, the baby is receiving 398 milliliters of milk daily in this new situation.
