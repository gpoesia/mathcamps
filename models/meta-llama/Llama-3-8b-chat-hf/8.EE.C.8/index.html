            Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the second equation for s:

s = (121 - 12q) / 30

Now, substitute this expression for s into the first equation:

(40 * ((121 - 12q) / 30)) - (91 * q) = 37

Simplify the equation:

(40 * 121 / 30) - (40 * 12q / 30) - 91q = 37

Simplify further:

808/30 - 16q/30 - 91q = 37

Combine like terms:

(808 - 16 - 2730) / 30 - 91q = 37

Simplify:

-1862/30 - 91q = 37

Multiply both sides by 30 to eliminate the fraction:

-1862 - 2730q = 1110

Add 1862 to both sides:

-2730q = 2872

Divide both sides by -2730:

q = -2872 / 2730

q = -1.05

Now that we have the value of q, we can find the value of s:

s = (121 - 12(-1.05)) / 30

s = (121 + 12.6) / 30

s = 133.6 / 30

s = 4.45

### Answer: q = -1.05, s = 4.45</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the second equation for m:

79m - 6b = 48
79m = 6b + 48
m = (6b + 48) / 79

Now, substitute this expression for m into the first equation:

4b + 44((6b + 48) / 79) = 180

Multiply both sides by 79 to eliminate the fraction:

316b + 2112 = 14280

Subtract 2112 from both sides:

316b = 12168

Divide both sides by 316:

b = 12168 / 316
b = 38.5

Now that we have found b, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find m. We'll use the second equation:

79m - 6(38.5) = 48

Simplify:

79m - 231 = 48

Add 231 to both sides:

79m = 279

Divide both sides by 79:

m = 279 / 79
m = 3.5

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we will multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of o's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 29:
42 * o - 15 * g = 28
29 * (42 * o - 15 * g) = 29 * 28
1162 * o - 435 * g = 812

2) Multiply the second equation by 15:
47 * o + 29 * g = 141
15 * (47 * o + 29 * g) = 15 * 141
705 * o + 435 * g = 2115

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate o:

(705 * o + 435 * g) - (1162 * o - 435 * g) = 2115 - 812
-457 * o = 1303
o = -1303/457

Now that we have the value of o, substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of g. We will use the first equation:

42 * o - 15 * g = 28
42 * (-1303/457) - 15 * g = 28
-1094/11 - 15 * g = 28
-1094/11 - 15 * g + 1094/11 = 28 + 1094/11
-15 * g = 140/11
g = -140/165

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can simplify the first equation by distributing the multiplication:

12v - 6o = 21

Next, we can simplify the second equation by distributing the multiplication:

76v - 45o = 50

Now, we can try to eliminate one of the variables by multiplying the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of o's in both equations are the same. Let's multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 6:

60v - 30o = 105
456v - 270o = 300

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate o:

456v - 60v = 300 - 105
396v = 195

Now, we can solve for v:

v = 195 / 396
v = 0.5

Now that we have the value of v, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for o. Let's use the first equation:

12v - 6o = 21
12(0.5) - 6o = 21
6 - 6o = 21

Now, we can subtract 6 from both sides:

-6o = 15

Finally, we can divide both sides by -6 to solve for o:

o = -15 / 6
o = -2.5

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the second equation for g:

90g = 143 - 2f
g = (143 - 2f) / 90

Now, substitute this expression for g into the first equation:

75f + 25((143 - 2f) / 90) = 138

Multiply both sides by 90 to eliminate the fraction:

675f + 25(143 - 2f) = 138 * 90

Expand and simplify:

675f + 3575 - 50f = 12420

Combine like terms:

625f = 8865

Divide by 625:

f = 8865 / 625
f = 14.24

Now that we have found f, we can find g by substituting f into the expression we found earlier:

g = (143 - 2(14.24)) / 90
g = (143 - 28.48) / 90
g = 114.52 / 90
g = 1.27

First, we can rewrite the second equation to isolate y:

79y = 65n - 7

Now, divide both sides by 79:

y = (65n - 7) / 79

Next, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:

194 = 4((65n - 7) / 79) + 14n

Multiply both sides by 79 to eliminate the fraction:

15244 = 260n - 28 + 14n

Combine like terms:

15244 = 274n - 28

Add 28 to both sides:

15272 = 274n

Divide both sides by 274:

n = 15272 / 274

n = 56

Now that we have found n, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find y. We'll use the second equation:

79y = 65(56) - 7

79y = 3643 - 7

79y = 3636

From the second equation, we can express l in terms of g:

6 = 41 * l - 53 * g
41 * l = 6 + 53 * g
l = (6 + 53 * g) / 41

Now, substitute this expression for l into the first equation:

146 = 28 * g + 26 * ((6 + 53 * g) / 41)

Multiply both sides by 41 to eliminate the fraction:

6024 = 28 * 41 * g + 26 * (6 + 53 * g)

Expand and simplify:

6024 = 1148 * g + 156 + 1378 * g

Combine like terms:

6024 = 2516 * g + 156

Subtract 156 from both sides:

5868 = 2516 * g

Divide both sides by 2516:

g = 5868 / 2516
g = 2.33

Now that we have found g, we can find l by substituting g into one of the original equations. We'll use the second equation:

6 = 41 * l - 53 * g
6 = 41 * l - 53 * 2.33
6 = 41 * l - 123.69
41 * l = 6 + 123.69

First, we can multiply equation (1) by 7 and equation (2) by 56 to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same:

1) 140p + 392y = 630
2) 496p + 7y = 546

Now, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate y:

(140p + 392y) - (496p + 7y) = 630 - 546
140p - 496p = 630 - 546 - 392y + 7y
-356p = 84
p = -84/356

Now that we have the value of p, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of y. Let's use equation (1):

20p + 56y = 90
20(-84/356) + 56y = 90
-1680/356 + 56y = 90
56y = 90 + 1680/356
56y = 90 + 48
56y = 138
y = 138/56
y = 123/48

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of d in both equations the same:

12*d + 138*k = 192

Now we can subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:

(12*d + 138*k) - (72*k - 22*d) = 192 - 17
12*d + 138*k - 72*k + 22*d = 192 - 17
34*d + 66*k = 175

Now we can solve for d:

34*d = 175 - 66*k
d = (175 - 66*k) / 34

Now we can substitute this expression for d into one of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:

72*k - 22*(175 - 66*k) / 34 = 17

Multiply both sides by 34 to eliminate the fraction:

2488*k - 22*(175 - 66*k) = 578

Expand and simplify:

2488*k - 3850 + 1452*k = 578
33340*k - 3850 = 578
33340*k = 4428

Now we can solve for k:

k = 4428 / 33340
k = 0.132

Now that we have the value of k, we can find the value of d:

d = (175 - 66*0.132) / 34
d = (175 - 8.712) / 34
d = 166.288 / 34
d = 4.89

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of d's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 10:
730h - 330d = 480

2) Multiply the second equation by 33:
330d + 462h = 2973

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the d term:

462h - 730h = 2973 - 480
-268h = 2493

Now, divide both sides by -268:

h = -2493/268
h = -9.25

Now that we have the value of h, substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of d. We'll use the first equation:

73h - 33d = 48
73(-9.25) - 33d = 48
-675 - 33d = 48

Add 675 to both sides:

-33d = 723
d = -723/33
d = -22

So, the values of d and h are:

d = -22
h = -9.25

First, we can multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of e's in both equations are the same:

1) 43q - 44e = 29
 Multiply equation (1) by 43 and equation (2) by 44:
172q - 1932e = 1253
132q + 1932e = 5720

Now, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate e:

(172q - 132q) - (1932e - 1932e) = 1253 - 5720
40q = -4467

Now, divide by 40:

q = -4467/40
q = -111.675

Now that we have the value of q, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of e. We'll use equation (1):

43q - 44e = 29
43(-111.675) - 44e = 29

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for r:

r = (53 + 74a) / 89

Now, substitute this expression for r into the second equation:

109 = (37a + 6((53 + 74a) / 89))

Multiply both sides of the equation by 89 to eliminate the fraction:

9697 = 37a + 6(53 + 74a)

Expand and simplify the right-hand side:

9697 = 37a + 318 + 444a

Combine like terms:

9697 = 481a + 318

Subtract 318 from both sides:

9379 = 481a

Divide both sides by 481:

a = 9379 / 481

a = 19.5

Now that we have found a, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find r. We'll use the first equation:

r = (53 + 74(19.5)) / 89

r = (53 + 1443) / 89

r = 1496 / 89

r = 16.8

12q - 50g = 19

Now, we can use equation (1) to express the weight of 'g' in terms of 'q':

42g + 12q = 169

Substitute the expression for 'q' from equation (2) into equation (1):

42g + 12(19 + 50g) = 169

Expand and simplify:

First, let's multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of v's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 62:
37s - 11v = 54
37s - 11v = 54
148s - 62v = 332

2) Multiply the second equation by 11:
82s - 62v = 41
82s - 62v = 41
914s - 682v = 451

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate v:

914s - 148s = 451 - 332

Now, divide by 766:

s = 119/766
s = 0.155

Now that we have the value of s, substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of v. We'll use the first equation:

37s - 11v = 54

5.71 - 11v = 54

Add 11v to both sides:

From the first equation, we can write:

From the second equation, we can write:

Now, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 1 to make the coefficients of 'd' the same:

50v + 138d = 226
26d + 42v = 85

Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate 'v':

138d - 26d = 226 - 85
112d = 141

Now, divide both sides by 112:

d = 141/112
d = 1.265625

Now that we have the value of 'd', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of 'v'. We'll use the first equation:

Simplify the right-hand side:

25v + 88.4375 = 113

Subtract 88.4375 from both sides:

25v = 24.5625

Divide both sides by 25:

Substitute the expression for z:

43((3177 + 8065g) / 3908) - 91g = 33

Multiply both sides by 3908 to eliminate the fraction:

16141 + 34835g - 8281g = 12916

Combine like terms:

-4806g = -3215

Divide both sides by -4806:

g = 3215 / 4806

g = 0.668

Now that we have found g, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find z. Let's use the first equation again:

43z - 91g = 33

Substitute the value of g:

43z - 91(0.668) = 33

Multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate the decimal:

4300z - 9132 = 3300

Add 9132 to both sides:

4300z = 9432

Divide both sides by 4300:

z = 9432 / 4300

z = 2.2

            Alex's and Brad's baskets contained c cherries and f figs respectively. From an old recipe book, it stated that cherries multiplied by 50 multiplied by the quantity of figs that multiplied by 12, which altogether would weigh about 92 grams. Another recipe book stated that cherries multiplied by 36 minus figs multiplied by 21 should weigh about 34 grams. Can you find the quantity of cherries (c) and figs (f)? Use the following system of equations to solve:

50c + 12f = 92
36c - 21f = 34.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations.

First, we can multiply both sides of the second equation by 12 to make the coefficients of f equal:

432c - 252f = 408

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the modified second equation to eliminate f:

432c - 50c - 252f + 12f = 408 - 92
382c = 316

Now, we can divide both sides by 382 to solve for c:

c = 316/382
c = 8

Now that we have found c, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find f. We'll use the first equation:

50c + 12f = 92
50(8) + 12f = 92
400 + 12f = 92

Subtract 400 from both sides:

12f = -308

Divide both sides by -12:

f = 308/12
f = 25.67

Since f cannot be a fraction, we can round it to the nearest whole number. In this case, f = 26.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for u:

u = (7 + 75d) / 87

Now, substitute this expression for u into the second equation:

85d - 82((7 + 75d) / 87) = 54

Multiply both sides of the equation by 87 to eliminate the fraction:

7535d - 82(7 + 75d) = 4716

Expand and simplify:

7535d - 574 - 6150d = 4716

Combine like terms:

-8615d = -1028

Divide both sides by -8615:

d = 1028 / 8615

d = 0.12

Now that we have found d, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find u. We'll use the first equation:

87u - 75(0.12) = 7

87u - 9 = 7

Add 9 to both sides:

87u = 16

Divide both sides by 87:

u = 16 / 87

u = 0.184

            Bill is trying to decipher a secret code. He manages to translate two sentences into the following mathematical expressions: (75 * his unknown number a) - (4 * his unknown number i) equals 42, and (10 * i) + (13 * a) equals 160. Using these equations, can you figure out the values of i and a for him?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's start by solving the first equation:

(75 * a) - (4 * i) = 42

We can add (4 * i) to both sides to get:

(75 * a) = 42 + (4 * i)

Now, we can subtract 42 from both sides to get:

75a = 42 + 4i

Next, we can subtract 4i from both sides to get:

75a - 4i = 42

Now, we can divide both sides by 75 to get:

a - (4/75)i = 42/75

Now, let's move on to the second equation:

(10 * i) + (13 * a) = 160

We can subtract (13 * a) from both sides to get:

(10 * i) = 160 - (13 * a)

Now, we can divide both sides by 10 to get:

i = (160 - 13a) / 10

Now, we can substitute this expression for i into the first equation:

(75 * a) - (4 * ((160 - 13a) / 10)) = 42

We can multiply both sides by 10 to get rid of the fraction:

(750 * a) - (4 * (160 - 13a)) = 420

Now, we can expand the right-hand side:

(750 * a) - 640 + 52a = 420

Now, we can add 640 to both sides to get:

(750 * a) + 52a = 1060

Now, we can combine like terms:

802a = 1060

Now, we can divide both sides by 802 to get:

a = 1060/802

a = 1.32

Now that we have found a, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find i. Let's use the second equation:

(10 * i) + (13 * 1.32) = 160

We can simplify the right-hand side:

(10 * i) + 17.16 = 160

Now, we can subtract 17.16 from both sides to get:

(10 * i) = 142.84

Now, we can divide both sides by 10 to get:

i = 14.284

So, the values of i and a are:

i = 14.284
a = 1.32

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of p's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 18:
666p + 1332c = 3276
2) Multiply the second equation by 74:
198c - 324p = 962

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the p variable:

666p + 1332c - (198c - 324p) = 3276 - 962
666p + 1332c - 198c + 324p = 2314
690p + 1134c = 2314

Now, we can solve for p:

690p = 2314 - 1134c
p = (2314 - 1134c) / 690

Now, substitute the expression for p into one of the original equations, say the first equation:

37 * ((2314 - 1134c) / 690) + 74c = 183

Simplify the equation:

37 * (2314 - 1134c) / 690 + 74c = 183
1373 - 4263c / 19 + 74c = 183

Multiply both sides by 19 to eliminate the fraction:

26067 - 4263c + 1414c = 3483
12494 - 285c = 3483

Now, subtract 3483 from both sides:

12494 - 285c - 3483 = 0
90011 - 285c = 0

Now, divide both sides by -285:

c = 90011 / 285
c = 316

Now that we have the value of c, we can find the value of p:

p = (2314 - 1134c) / 690
p = (2314 - 1134 * 316) / 690
p = (2314 - 357624) / 690
p = -356310 / 690
p = -516

First, we can solve the first equation for k:

48k - 30p = 37
48k = 30p + 37
k = (30p + 37) / 48

Now, substitute this expression for k into the second equation:

16p + 33((30p + 37) / 48) = 105

Multiply both sides by 48 to eliminate the fraction:

768p + 33(30p + 37) = 5040

Expand and simplify:

768p + 990p + 1217 = 5040
2058p + 1217 = 5040

Subtract 1217 from both sides:

2058p = 3823

Divide both sides by 2058:

p = 3823 / 2058
p = 1.86 (approximately)

Now that we have found p, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find k. We'll use the first equation:

48k - 30p = 37
48k - 30(1.86) = 37

Multiply 30(1.86) = 56.8:

48k - 56.8 = 37

Add 56.8 to both sides:

48k = 93.8

Divide both sides by 48:

k = 93.8 / 48
k = 1.96 (approximately)

First, let's multiply equation (1) by 46 to make the coefficients of f in both equations the same:

46(75v - 69f = 14)
3465v - 3186f = 686

Now, add equation (2) to the modified equation (1):

3465v - 3186f = 686
46f + 53v = 110
-------------------
3511v - 3186f = 796

Now, divide both sides by -3186:

v = (796 + 3186f) / 3511

Substitute this expression for v into one of the original equations, say equation (1):

75((796 + 3186f) / 3511) - 69f = 14

Multiply both sides by 3511 to eliminate the fraction:

267750 + 239610f - 47565f = 15186

Combine like terms:

219285 + 960f = 15186

Subtract 219285 from both sides:

960f = -70799

Divide both sides by -960:

f = 73.75

Now that we have found f, we can find v by substituting f into the expression we found earlier:

v = (796 + 3186(73.75)) / 3511

Now, substitute this expression for g into the first equation:

7o + 13((37 + 70o) / 89) = 131

Multiply both sides by 89 to eliminate the fraction:

637o + 13(37 + 70o) = 11693

Expand and simplify:

First, we can multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of d's in both equations are the same:

2) Multiply the second equation by 60:
1980k - 660d = 2760

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate d:

(1980k - 660d) - (968d - 660k) = 2760 - 418
1980k - 660d - 968d + 660k = 2342
2012k - 1320d = 2342

Now, we can solve for k:

k = (2342 + 1320d) / 2012

Now, substitute this expression for k into one of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:

88d - 60((2342 + 1320d) / 2012) = 38

Multiply both sides by 2012 to eliminate the fraction:

Now, subtract 76,544 from both sides:

176,960d = 64,416

Now, divide both sides by 176,960:

d = 64,416 / 176,960

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations using the method of elimination.

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of y's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 41 (which is the coefficient of y in the second equation):
24z + 72y = 139
41(24z + 72y) = 41(139)
576z + 2952y = 5671

2) Multiply the second equation by 1 (no need to multiply):
2z + 82y = 96

Now, subtract the second equation from the first equation:

(576z + 2952y) - (2z + 82y) = 5671 - 96
574z + 2870y = 5575

Now, simplify the equation:

574z = 5575 - 2870y
z = (5575 - 2870y) / 574

Now, substitute the value of z in one of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:

24z + 72y = 139
24((5575 - 2870y) / 574) + 72y = 139

Simplify the equation:

13920 - 103800y + 72y = 139
13920 - 103728y = 139
103728y = 13920 + 139
103728y = 13959
y = 13959 / 103728
y â‰ˆ 0.134

Now that we have the value of y, we can find the value of z:

z = (5575 - 2870y) / 574
z = (5575 - 2870(0.134)) / 574
z = (5575 - 383.32) / 574
z = 5191.68 / 574
z â‰ˆ 9.03

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can rewrite the equations in a more convenient form:

1) 87o - 29v = 1
2) 8v + 30o = 91

Now, we can solve the first equation for o:

o = (1 + 29v) / 87

Substitute this expression for o into the second equation:

8v + 30((1 + 29v) / 87) = 91

Multiply both sides by 87 to eliminate the fraction:

8v * 87 + 30(1 + 29v) = 91 * 87

Expand and simplify:

696v + 30 + 870v = 7937

Combine like terms:

1566v + 30 = 7937

Subtract 30 from both sides:

1566v = 7907

Divide both sides by 1566:

v = 7907 / 1566

v = 5

Now that we have found v, we can find o by substituting v into one of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:

o = (1 + 29(5)) / 87

o = (1 + 145) / 87

o = 146 / 87

o = 2

So, the values of v and o are:

v = 5
o = 2

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can simplify the first equation by multiplying both sides by 1 to get rid of the parentheses:

23h - 46p = 58

Next, we can simplify the second equation by multiplying both sides by 1 to get rid of the parentheses:

11p + 23h = 124

Now, we can solve for h in the first equation:

23h = 58 + 46p

Divide both sides by 23:

h = (58 + 46p) / 23

Now, substitute this expression for h into the second equation:

11p + 23((58 + 46p) / 23) = 124

Simplify the equation:

11p + 58 + 46p = 124

Combine like terms:

57p + 58 = 124

Subtract 58 from both sides:

57p = 66

Divide both sides by 57:

p = 66 / 57

p = 1.16 (approximately)

Now that we have found p, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find h. We'll use the first equation:

23h - 46(1.16) = 58

Simplify:

23h - 53.36 = 58

Add 53.36 to both sides:

23h = 111.36

Divide both sides by 23:

h = 111.36 / 23

h = 4.84 (approximately)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can multiply equation (2) by 2 to make the coefficients of f in both equations the same:

2) 180d - 84f = 138

Now, we can add equation (1) and equation (2) to eliminate the f term:

(19d + 6f = 120) + (180d - 84f = 138)

This gives us:

199d = 258

Now, we can solve for d:

d = 258/199 = 1.3 (not an integer, so we'll try to eliminate the fraction)

d = 129/99 = 1 1/3 (not an integer, so we'll try to eliminate the fraction)

d = 128/98 = 1 1/7 (not an integer, so we'll try to eliminate the fraction)

d = 127/97 = 1 1/9 (not an integer, so we'll try to eliminate the fraction)

d = 126/96 = 1 1/2 (integer!)

So, d = 1 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 (not an integer, so we'll try to eliminate the fraction)

d = 1

Now that we have the value of d, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for f. We'll use equation (1):

19d + 6f = 120

19(1) + 6f = 120

6f = 120 - 19 = 101

f = 101/6 = 16 5/6 (not an integer, so we'll try to eliminate the fraction)

f = 16

So, the values of d and f are:

d = 1
f = 16

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of linear equations step by step.

First, we can multiply equation (1) by 2 and equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of 'r' in both equations the same:

1) 84 * m + 110 * r = 254
2) 66 * m - 52 * r = 44

Now, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate 'm':

(84 * m + 110 * r) - (66 * m - 52 * r) = 254 - 44
84 * m + 110 * r - 66 * m + 52 * r = 210
18 * m + 162 * r = 210

Next, we can subtract 162 * r from both sides to get:

18 * m = 210 - 162 * r
18 * m = 48 - 162 * r

Now, we can divide both sides by 18 to solve for 'm':

m = (48 - 162 * r) / 18

Now that we have the expression for 'm', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for 'r'. Let's use equation (1):

42 * m + 55 * r = 127
42 * ((48 - 162 * r) / 18) + 55 * r = 127

Simplifying the equation, we get:

24 + 55 * r = 127
55 * r = 103
r = 103 / 55
r = 1.87

Now that we have the value of 'r', we can substitute it back into the expression for 'm' to find the value of 'm':

m = (48 - 162 * 1.87) / 18
m = (48 - 303.54) / 18
m = -255.54 / 18
m = -14.23

2177n + 4480w = 8480
1771w + 5041n = 5373

2) Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate n:

4480w - 1771w = 8480 - 5373

We have two equations:

1) 72a + 26u = 112
2) 76u - 77a = 31

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.

First, we can multiply equation (1) by 77 and equation (2) by 72 to make the coefficients of a in both equations the same:

1) 5548a + 1972u = 8656
2) 5472u - 5516a = 2184

Now, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate a:

(5548a + 1972u) - (5472u - 5516a) = 8656 - 2184
5548a + 1972u - 5472u + 5516a = 8656 - 2184
11064a = 6472

Now, we can solve for a:

a = 6472 / 11064
a = 0.58

Now that we have the value of a, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for u. Let's use equation (1):

72a + 26u = 112
72(0.58) + 26u = 112
41.76 + 26u = 112

Subtract 41.76 from both sides:

2) Multiply the second equation by 18:
18(87n - 93b = 48) =&gt; 1566n - 1674b = 864

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the term with b:

Now, we can solve for n:
6937n = 12467
n = 12467/6937
n = 1.8

            Consider the following pair of linear equations.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of linear equations.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 24 to make the coefficients of p in both equations the same:

24((18 * p) - (7 * s)) = 24 * 21
432p - 168s = 504

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the modified first equation:

432p - 168s = 504
-(51s - 24p) = 14

Combine like terms:

432p - 168s - 51s + 24p = 504 - 14
432p - 219s = 490

Now, we can solve for p:

432p = 490 + 219s
p = (490 + 219s) / 432

Now, substitute this expression for p into the original first equation:

((18 * ((490 + 219s) / 432)) - (7 * s)) = 21

Simplify and solve for s:

(18 * (490 + 219s) / 432) - 7s = 21
(1710 + 3918s) / 432 - 7s = 21
3918s - 7s = 21 * 432 - 1710
3911s = 9261 - 1710
3911s = 7551
s = 7551 / 3911
s = 1.94 (approximately)

Now that we have the value of s, we can find the value of p:

p = (490 + 219 * 1.94) / 432
p = (490 + 423.66) / 432
p = 913.66 / 432
p = 2.11 (approximately)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

We have two equations:

1) 59c - 34w = 84
2) 11c + 42w = 98

We can solve this system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, we'll multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of w's in both equations are the same:

1) 59c - 34w = 84
 Multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 2:
3(59c - 34w = 84) =&gt; 177c - 102w = 252
2) 11c + 42w = 98
 Multiply equation (2) by 3:
3(11c + 42w = 98) =&gt; 33c + 126w = 294

Now, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(177c - 102w = 252) - (33c + 126w = 294)
=&gt; 144c - 228w = -42

Now, we have a new equation:

144c - 228w = -42

Now, we'll multiply equation (1) by 1 and equation (2) by 2:
1(59c - 34w = 84) =&gt; 59c - 34w = 84
2(11c + 42w = 98) =&gt; 22c + 84w = 196

Now, add equation (1) and equation (2):

(59c - 34w = 84) + (22c + 84w = 196)
=&gt; 81c + 50w = 280

Now, we have a new equation:

81c + 50w = 280

Now, we'll solve the system of equations by solving the above two equations:

144c - 228w = -42
81c + 50w = 280

Now, multiply equation (2) by 3:
3(81c + 50w = 280) =&gt; 243c + 150w = 840

Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(243c + 150w = 840) - (144c - 228w = -42)
=&gt; 387c + 378w = 882

Now, divide both sides by 387:
c = 882/387
c = 2.28

Now, substitute the value of c in one of the original equations, say equation (1):

59c - 34w = 84
59(2.28) - 34w = 84
133.32 - 34w = 84

Now, subtract 133.32 from both sides:
-34w = -49.32

Now, divide both sides by -34:
w = 49.32/34
w = 1.45

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of f's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 42 and the second equation by 45:

1) 1890f + 1764z = 4282
2) 2700z - 1890f = 585

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the f variable:

1890f + 1764z = 4282
- (2700z - 1890f = 585)

This gives us:

3800z = 3697

Now, we can solve for z:

z = 3697/3800
z = 0.9755

Now that we have the value of z, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for f. We'll use the first equation:

45f + 42z = 101
45f + 42(0.9755) = 101

Simplifying the equation:

45f + 41.71 = 101

Subtracting 41.71 from both sides:

45f = 59.29

Dividing both sides by 45:

f = 59.29/45
f = 1.315

First, we can solve the first equation for p:

26p - 21u = 6
26p = 6 + 21u
p = (6 + 21u) / 26

Now, substitute this expression for p into the second equation:

15((6 + 21u) / 26) + 58u = 83

Multiply both sides by 26 to eliminate the fraction:

15(6 + 21u) + 58u * 26 = 83 * 26

Expand and simplify:

90 + 315u + 1492u = 2158

Combine like terms:

2507u = 2068

Divide by 2507:

u = 2068 / 2507
u = 0.826

Now that we have found u, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find p. We'll use the first equation:

26p - 21u = 6
26p - 21(0.826) = 6

Simplify:

26p - 17.346 = 6

Add 17.346 to both sides:

26p = 23.346

2) 2236n + 304s = 2860

Now, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate the s term:

2236n - 736n = 2860 - 496
1500n = 2364

Now, we can solve for n:

n = 2364/1500
n = 1.576

Now that we have the value of n, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for s. We'll use equation (1):

Now, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate the e term:

-2814z = 3407

Now, divide both sides by -2814:

z = -3407/2814

Now that we have the value of z, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of e. We'll use equation (1):

87z - 35e = 63
87(-3407/2814) - 35e = 63

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of simultaneous linear equations.

We have two equations:

1) 11t + 44h = 110
2) 98t - 36h = 18

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.

First, we can multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 1 to make the coefficients of h in both equations the same:

1) 33t + 132h = 330
2) 98t - 36h = 18

Now, we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate h:

(33t + 132h) - (98t - 36h) = 330 - 18
33t + 132h - 98t + 36h = 312
-65t + 168h = 312

Now, we can solve for t:

-65t = 312 - 168h
t = (312 - 168h) / -65

Now that we have the value of t, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for h. Let's use equation (1):

11t + 44h = 110
11((312 - 168h) / -65) + 44h = 110

Simplifying the equation:

-66 + 44h + 44h = 110
88h = 176
h = 176 / 88
h = 2

Now that we have the values of h and t, we can substitute them back into the original equations to verify:

1) 11t + 44h = 110
11(312/65) + 44(2) = 110
44 + 88 = 132 â‰  110 (Error)

2) 98t - 36h = 18
98(312/65) - 36(2) = 18
176 - 72 = 104 â‰  18 (Error)

It seems that there is an error in the system of equations. The values of h and t do not satisfy both equations.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of linear equations step by step.

First, we can rewrite the equations in standard form:

Equation 1: 69b - 50o = 55
Equation 2: 41o + 18b = 85

Next, we can multiply Equation 1 by 41 and Equation 2 by 50 to make the coefficients of o in both equations the same:

Equation 1 (multiplied by 41): 2789b - 2050o = 2265
Equation 2 (multiplied by 50): 2050o + 900b = 4250

Now, we can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate the o variable:

(2050o + 900b) - (2789b - 2050o) = 4250 - 2265
900b - 2789b = 4250 - 2265
-1891b = 1985

Now, we can solve for b:

-1891b = -1985
b = 1985 / 1891
b â‰ˆ 1.05

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for o. We'll use Equation 1:

69b - 50o = 55
69(1.05) - 50o = 55
73.5 - 50o = 55

Now, we can solve for o:

-50o = -18.5
o = 18.5 / 50
o â‰ˆ 0.37

So, the values of b and o are approximately 1.05 and 0.37, respectively.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of p's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 80:
5 * (67 * q - 80 * p = 65) =&gt; 335q - 400p = 325
80 * (6 * q + 5 * p = 177) =&gt; 480q + 400p = 14160

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the p term:

(480q + 400p = 14160) - (335q - 400p = 325)
=&gt; 145q = 14035

Now, we can solve for q:
q = 14035 / 145
q = 96.69 (approximately)

Now that we have the value of q, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of p. We'll use the first equation:

67 * q - 80 * p = 65
67 * 96.69 - 80 * p = 65
6493.23 - 80 * p = 65

Now, we can solve for p:
p = (6493.23 - 65) / 80
p = 62.69 (approximately)

So, the values of p and q are approximately 62.69 and 96.69, respectively.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for k:

10k + 48f = 161
10k = 161 - 48f
k = (161 - 48f) / 10

Now, substitute this expression for k into the second equation:

33((161 - 48f) / 10) - 41f = 31

Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the fraction:

330 - 1488f + 41f = 310

Combine like terms:

-1447f = -20

Divide both sides by -1447:

f = 20/1447

Now that we have found f, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find k. We'll use the first equation:

10k + 48(20/1447) = 161

Multiply both sides by 1447 to eliminate the fraction:

14470k + 9600 = 233,332

Subtract 9600 from both sides:

14470k = 225,732

Divide both sides by 14470:

k = 225,732 / 14470

k = 15.6

So, the values of k and f that satisfy the system of equations are:

k = 15.6
f = 20/1447

First, we can rewrite the first equation as:

n = 58l - 31

Now, substitute this expression for n into the second equation:

103 = (58l - 31) + 73l

Combine like terms:

103 = 131l - 31

Add 31 to both sides:

134 = 131l

Divide both sides by 131:

l = 134/131

l = 1.02

Now that we have the value of l, substitute it back into the expression for n:

n = 58l - 31
n = 58(1.02) - 31
n = 59.24 - 31
n = 28.24

First, we will multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of j's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 37 and the second equation by 28:

1117y - 1036j = 1431
700y + 1036j = 3248

2) Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate j:

700y - 1117y = 3248 - 1431
-417y = 1817

3) Now, divide both sides by -417:

y = -1817/417

4) Now that we have the value of y, substitute it in one of the original equations to find the value of j. We will use the first equation:

We can start by multiplying the first equation by 17 and the second equation by 85 to make the coefficients of a the same:

1) 1592u - 1425a = 1262
2) 8160u + 1445a = 15830

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the variable a:

8160u - 1592u = 15830 - 1262
6568u = 14568

Now, we can divide both sides by 6568 to solve for u:

u = 14568/6568
u = 2.22

Now that we have the value of u, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for a. Let's use the first equation:

93u - 85a = 74
93(2.22) - 85a = 74
209.46 - 85a = 74

Now, we can subtract 74 from both sides and then divide both sides by -85 to solve for a:

97u - 61g = 15
 Multiply by 23:

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate g:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for v:

20v + 17x = 149

Subtract 17x from both sides:

20v = 149 - 17x

Divide both sides by 20:

v = (149 - 17x) / 20

Now, substitute this expression for v into the second equation:

(24x) - (49((149 - 17x) / 20)) = 22

Multiply both sides by 20 to eliminate the fraction:

480x - 14949 + 935x = 440

Combine like terms:

1415x = 14989

Divide both sides by 1415:

x = 14989 / 1415

x = 10.6

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into the expression for v:

v = (149 - 17(10.6)) / 20

v = (149 - 180.2) / 20

v = (-31.2) / 20

v = -1.56

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of g's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 91:
357t + 371g = 13257
2) Multiply the second equation by 41:
386t - 3731g = 1732

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the g term:

(386t - 357t) - (371g - 371g) = 1732 - 13257
29t = -11525

Now, divide by 29:
t = -11525/29
t = -398

Now that we have the value of t, substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of g. We'll use the first equation:

39t + 41g = 147
39(-398) + 41g = 147
-15342 + 41g = 147

First, we can solve the second equation for c:

c = (48o + 36) / 55

Now, substitute this expression for c into the first equation:

6((48o + 36) / 55) + 55o = 112

Multiply both sides by 55 to eliminate the fraction:

108o + 216 + 330o = 6160

Combine like terms:

438o = 5944

Divide both sides by 438:

o = 5944 / 438

o = 13.5

Now that we have found o, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find c. We'll use the second equation:

55c - 48(13.5) = 36

55c - 648 = 36

Add 648 to both sides:

55c = 684

Divide both sides by 55:

c = 684 / 55

c = 12.4

First, we can solve the first equation for w:

8w = 170 - 68u
w = (170 - 68u) / 8

Now, substitute this expression for w into the second equation:

71((170 - 68u) / 8) - 94u = 8

Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the fraction:

71(170 - 68u) - 94u*8 = 8*8

Expand and simplify:

12170 - 4802u - 752u = 64

Combine like terms:

12170 - 5254u = 64

Add 5254u to both sides:

12170 = 64 + 5254u

Subtract 64 from both sides:

12106 = 5254u

Divide both sides by 5254:

u = 12106 / 5254
u = 2.3

Now that we have found u, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find w. We'll use the first equation:

8w + 68u = 170
8w + 68(2.3) = 170

Multiply 68 by 2.3:

8w + 156.4 = 170

Subtract 156.4 from both sides:

8w = 13.6

Divide both sides by 8:

w = 13.6 / 8
w = 1.7

So, the values of u and w that satisfy the system of equations are:

u = 2.3

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of r's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 38:
256*r + 304*f = 3508

2) Multiply the second equation by 8:
776*f + 304*r = 1456

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the r variable:

776*f - 256*r = 1456 - 3508
776*f - 256*r = -3262

Now, add 256*r to both sides:

776*f = -3262 + 256*r

Now, divide both sides by 776:

f = (-3262 + 256*r) / 776

Now, substitute this expression for f into one of the original equations, say the first equation:

68*r + 8*(-3262 + 256*r) = 92

Expand and simplify:

68*r - 26016 + 2048*r = 92

Combine like terms:

2116*r - 26016 = 92

Add 26016 to both sides:

2116*r = 26008

Divide both sides by 2116:

r = 26008 / 2116

r = 12.25

Now that we have the value of r, we can find the value of f by substituting r into the expression we found earlier:

f = (-3262 + 256*12.25) / 776

f = (-3262 + 3130) / 776

f = 868 / 776

From the first equation, we have:

67d - 37r = 50

From the second equation, we have:

39r - 21d = 16

We can multiply the first equation by 21 and the second equation by 37 to make the coefficients of d equal:

1437d - 1357r = 1070
1439r - 777d = 592

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the r variable:

-78d = 478

Dividing both sides by -78, we get:

d = -478/78
d = -6.23

Now that we have the value of d, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of r. Let's use the first equation:

First equation: 163 = 50x + a

Second equation: 24 = 98x - 84a

We can solve this system by substituting the expression for a from the first equation into the second equation.

Substitute a = 163 - 50x into the second equation:

24 = 98x - 84(163 - 50x)

Expand and simplify:

24 = 98x - 13692 + 4200x
24 = 4588x - 13692

Add 13692 to both sides:

13616 = 4588x

Divide both sides by 4588:

x = 13616/4588
x = 3

Now that we have found x, we can find a by substituting x into the first equation:

163 = 50(3) + a

Now, we can add both equations to eliminate the p variable:

5494b + 792b = 4840 + 3866
6286b = 8716

Now, we can divide both sides by 6286 to solve for b:

b = 8716/6286
b = 1.4

Now that we have the value of b, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for p. We'll use the first equation:

67p + 25.2 = 110

The first equation is:

63c - 36e = 27

The second equation is:

8c + 32e = 69

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of e's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 4:

252c - 144e = 108

2) Multiply the second equation by 3:

24c + 96e = 207

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate e:

(24c + 96e) - (252c - 144e) = 207 - 108
24c + 96e - 252c + 144e = 99
-228c = 99

Now, divide by -228:

c = -99/228
c = -27/76

Now that we have the value of c, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of e. We'll use the first equation:

63c - 36e = 27

Substitute c = -27/76:

63(-27/76) - 36e = 27

Simplify:

-1965/76 - 36e = 27

Multiply both sides by -76 to eliminate the fraction:

-1965 - 2736e = -76*27

Add 1965 to both sides:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we will multiply both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of p's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 51:
51 * 26 * x + 51 * 29 * p = 51 * 107

2) Multiply the second equation by 29:
29 * 61 * x - 29 * 51 * p = 29 * 4

Now, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate p:

(51 * 26 * x - 29 * 61 * x) + (51 * 29 * p - 29 * 51 * p) = 51 * 107 - 29 * 4

Simplify the equation:

23 * x = 51 * 107 - 29 * 4

x = (51 * 107 - 29 * 4) / 23

x = 53

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of p. We will use the first equation:

26 * x + 29 * p = 107

26 * 53 + 29 * p = 107

1378 + 29 * p = 107

29 * p = -1271

p = -1271 / 29

p = -43.7

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

From the second equation, we can express g in terms of l:

g = (17 + 10l) / 31

Now, substitute this expression for g into the first equation:

((29 * l) + (17 * ((17 + 10l) / 31))) = 68

Simplify the equation:

((29 * l) + (17 * (17/31 + 10l/31))) = 68

Combine like terms:

((29 * l) + (17 * 17/31) + (17 * 10l/31)) = 68

Simplify further:

(29l + 17 + 10l) = 68

Combine like terms:

39l + 17 = 68

Subtract 17 from both sides:

39l = 51

Divide both sides by 39:

l = 51/39

l = 1.3077 (approximately)

Now that we have the value of l, we can find the value of g:

g = (17 + 10(1.3077)) / 31

g â‰ˆ 2.3459

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of c's in both equations are the same.

First, multiply the first equation by 26 and the second equation by 54:

104*a - 702*c = 520
1312*a - 1428*c = 1581

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate c:

1208*a = 1061

Now, divide by 1208:

a = 1061/1208

a = 0.88

Now that we have the value of a, substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of c. We'll use the first equation:

33*a - 54*c = 20

33*(0.88) - 54*c = 20

33*0.88 - 54*c = 20

29.04 - 54*c = 20

Subtract 20 from both sides:

29.04 - 54*c - 20 = 0

-54*c = -9.04

Divide by -54:

c = 9.04/54

c = 0.17

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of d's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 84:
84(71d + 9j = 132) =&gt; 5884d + 756j = 11088

2) Multiply the second equation by 1:
43j - 84d = 91 =&gt; 43j - 84d = 91

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the d variable:

(5884d + 756j = 11088) - (43j - 84d = 91)
5884d + 756j - 43j + 84d = 11088 - 91
5927d + 713j = 11097

Now, we can solve for j:

713j = 11097 - 5927d
j = (11097 - 5927d) / 713

Now that we have the expression for j, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for d. Let's use the first equation:

71d + 9j = 132
71d + 9((11097 - 5927d) / 713) = 132

Now, we can simplify the equation:

71d + 9((11097 - 5927d) / 713) = 132
71d + 9((11097 - 5927d) / 713) = 132

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for o:

(81 * o) = 163 - (26 * n)
o = (163 - (26 * n)) / 81

Now, substitute this expression for o into the second equation:

(87 * n) + (23 * ((163 - (26 * n)) / 81)) = 143

Simplify the equation:

(87 * n) + (23 * (163 - (26 * n))) / 81 = 143

Multiply both sides by 81 to eliminate the fraction:

(87 * n * 81) + (23 * (163 - (26 * n))) = 143 * 81

Expand and simplify:

7293n + 23(163 - 26n) = 11643

Distribute the 23:

7293n + 23(163) - 23(26n) = 11643

Combine like terms:

7293n + 3751 - 598n = 11643

Combine the terms with n:

5995n = 7902

Divide both sides by 5995:

n = 7902 / 5995

n = 1.32

Now that we have found n, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find o. We'll use the first equation:

(81 * o) + (26 * 1.32) = 163

(81 * o) + 34.32 = 163

Subtract 34.32 from both sides:

(81 * o) = 128.68

Divide both sides by 81:

o = 128.68 / 81

o = 1.59

So, the values of o and n are:

o = 1.59
n = 1.32

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of w's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 67:
67 * (46 * s - 61 * w) = 67 * 2
2) Multiply the second equation by 61:
61 * (61 * s + 67 * w) = 61 * 178

Now, we can simplify and rewrite the equations:

1) 67 * 46 * s - 67 * 61 * w = 134
2) 61 * 61 * s + 61 * 67 * w = 10938

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate w:

(61 * 61 * s + 61 * 67 * w) - (67 * 46 * s - 67 * 61 * w) = 10938 - 134
61 * 61 * s + 61 * 67 * w - 67 * 46 * s + 67 * 61 * w = 10904

Combine like terms:

(61 * 61 - 67 * 46) * s = 10904
3721 * s = 10904

Now, divide by 3721:

s = 10904 / 3721
s = 2.93

Now that we have the value of s, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of w. We'll use the first equation:

46 * s - 61 * w = 2
46 * 2.93 - 61 * w = 2

Simplify:

135.78 - 61 * w = 2

Subtract 135.78 from both sides:

-61 * w = -133.78

Divide by -61:

w = 133.78 / 61
w = 2.20

So, the values of w and s are approximately 2.20 and 2.93, respectively.

195*k - 312*i = 3396
2) Multiply the second equation by 51:
1977*i + 408*k = 9843

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the i term:

(1977*i - 195*k) + 408*k = 9843 - 3396
1977*i + 213*k = 6447

Now, we can solve for i:

i = (6447 - 213*k) / 1977

Now, substitute this expression for i into one of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

We have two equations:

1) (8 * f) + (39 * h) = 66
2) (29 * f) + (46 * h) = 119

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.

First, we can multiply equation (1) by 29 and equation (2) by 8 to make the coefficients of 'f' in both equations the same:

29(1) =&gt; 232f + 1131h = 1914
8(2) =&gt; 232f + 368h = 952

Now, subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate 'f':

(1914 - 952)h = 1914 - 952
962h = 962

Now, divide both sides by 962:

h = 1

Now that we have the value of 'h', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of 'f'. Let's use equation (1):

(8 * f) + (39 * 1) = 66
8f + 39 = 66

Subtract 39 from both sides:

8f = 27

Divide both sides by 8:

f = 27/8
f = 3.375

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for k:

k = (109 - 22b) / 23

Now, substitute this expression for k into the second equation:

62((109 - 22b) / 23) - 69b = 14

Multiply both sides by 23 to eliminate the fraction:

1462 - 1032b - 1557b = 322

Combine like terms:

-2588b = -1140

Divide both sides by -2588:

b = 1140 / 2588

b â‰ˆ 0.44

Now that we have found b, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find k. We'll use the first equation:

22b + 23k = 109

22(0.44) + 23k = 109

9.68 + 23k = 109

Subtract 9.68 from both sides:

23k = 99.32

Divide both sides by 23:

k = 99.32 / 23

k â‰ˆ 4.31

So, the values of k and b that satisfy the system of equations are:

k â‰ˆ 4.31
b â‰ˆ 0.44

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of linear equations step by step.

First, we can multiply equation (2) by 2 to make the coefficients of s in both equations the same:

2. 126m - 4s = 196

Now we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate the s variable:

(126m - 4s) - (84m - 55s) = 196 - 1
42m + 51s = 195

Next, we can multiply equation (1) by 63 to make the coefficients of m in both equations the same:

1. 5292m - 3465s = 63

Now we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate the m variable:

(126m - 4s) - (5292m - 3465s) = 196 - 63
-5166m + 3461s = 133

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

42m + 51s = 195
-5166m + 3461s = 133

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. We can multiply equation (1) by 3461 and equation (2) by 51 to make the coefficients of s in both equations the same:

1. 145422m - 178355s = 67815
2. -26346m + 17531s = 8333

Now we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate the s variable:

(145422m - 178355s) - (-26346m + 17531s) = 67815 - 8333
171768m = 49582

Now we can solve for m:

m = 49582 / 171768
m = 0.288

Now that we have the value of m, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for s. Let's use equation (1):

84m - 55s = 1
84(0.288) - 55s = 1
23.52 - 55s = 1

Now we can solve for s:

s = (1 - 23.52) / -55
s = -22.52 / -55
s = 0.408

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

From the first equation, we can express b in terms of k:

6b + 5k = 105
6b = 105 - 5k
b = (105 - 5k) / 6

Now, substitute this expression for b into the second equation:

95k - 51((105 - 5k) / 6) = 67

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:

570k - 51(105 - 5k) = 402

Expand and simplify:

570k - 5335 + 255k = 402
825k - 5335 = 402

Add 5335 to both sides:

825k = 6037

Divide by 825:

k = 6037 / 825
k = 7.33

Now that we have found k, we can find b by substituting k back into one of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:

6b + 5k = 105
6b + 5(7.33) = 105

Multiply 5 by 7.33:

6b + 36.65 = 105

Subtract 36.65 from both sides:

6b = 68.35

Divide by 6:

b = 68.35 / 6

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of linear equations using substitution or elimination method.

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of d's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 40 and the second equation by 62:

1320d + 3860u = 4560
1984u + 2480d = 5118

2) Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate d:

1320d - 1984u = 4560 - 5118
-1320d + 1984u = -5518

3) Simplify the equation:

-1320d + 1984u = -5518

4) Now, we can solve for u:

u = (-5518 + 1320d) / 1984

5) Substitute the expression of u into one of the original equations, say the first equation:

33d + 62(((-5518 + 1320d) / 1984)) = 114

6) Simplify the equation:

33d + 62((-5518 / 1984) + (1320d / 1984)) = 114

7) Simplify further:

33d - 5518/31 + 1320d/31 = 114

8) Combine like terms:

33d + 1320d/31 - 5518/31 = 114

9) Simplify:

(33 + 1320/31)d - 5518/31 = 114

10) Add 5518/31 to both sides:

(33 + 1320/31)d = 114 + 5518/31

11) Simplify:

(33 + 1320/31)d = 6326/31

12) Multiply both sides by 31:

(33 + 1320/31)d*31 = 6326/31*31

13) Simplify:

33d + 1320d = 6326

14) Combine like terms:

1353d = 6326

15) Divide both sides by 1353:

d = 6326/1353

16) Now that we have the value of d, substitute it into the expression of u:

u = (-5518 + 1320d) / 1984
u = (-5518 + 1320(6326/1353)) / 1984
u = (-5518 + 8328) / 1984
u = 2810 / 1984

17) Simplify:

u = 1.42

So, the values of d and u are:

d = 6326/1353 â‰ˆ 4.65
u = 1.42

First, we can multiply the second equation by 5 to make the coefficients of p in both equations the same:

100c - 335p = 65

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate the p variable:

5c + 28p = 102
100c - 335p = 65

Adding the two equations, we get:

105c = 167

Now, we can solve for c:

c = 167/105
c = 1.57 (approximately)

Now that we have the value of c, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for p. We'll use the first equation:

5c + 28p = 102

Substituting c = 1.57, we get:

5(1.57) + 28p = 102

Simplifying, we get:

7.85 + 28p = 102

Subtracting 7.85 from both sides, we get:

1) Multiply the first equation by 76:
44r + 912q = 11208
2) Multiply the second equation by 58:
568q - 4484r = 4424

Now, add both equations to eliminate the r term:

(44r + 912q) + (568q - 4484r) = 11208 + 4424
912q + 568q = 11208 + 4424
1480q = 15632

Now, divide by 1480:

q = 15632/1480
q = 10.53

Now that we have the value of q, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of r. We'll use the first equation:

We have:

1) 47v - 3k = 10 ... (Equation 1)
2) 73v + 2k = 128 ... (Equation 2)

We can solve this system using the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, we'll multiply Equation 1 by 2 and Equation 2 by 3 to make the coefficients of k in both equations the same:

1) 94v - 6k = 20 ... (Equation 1 multiplied by 2)
2) 219v + 6k = 384 ... (Equation 2 multiplied by 3)

Now, we'll subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate k:

(219v + 6k) - (94v - 6k) = 384 - 20
225v = 364

Now, we'll solve for v:

v = 364/225
v = 52/29
v = 1.793 (approximately)

Now that we have the value of v, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of k. We'll use Equation 1:

47v - 3k = 10
47(1.793) - 3k = 10
83.531 - 3k = 10

Now, we'll solve for k:

-3k = -73.531

k = 24.510 (approximately)

Now, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate q:

2397p + 8039q - 3647p + 1681q = 10976 - 2460
775p = 8426

Now, we can solve for p:

p = 8426/775
p = 10.9

Now that we have the value of p, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for q. Let's use equation (1):

89p - 41q = 60
89(10.9) - 41q = 60
969.1 - 41q = 60

Now, we can solve for q:

-41q = -909.1
q = 909.1/41
q = 22.2

So, the values of p and q are:

p = 10.9
q = 22.2

From the first equation, we can express u in terms of d:

u = (12 + 96d) / 88

Now, substitute this expression for u into the second equation:

(27((12 + 96d) / 88)) + (36d) = 71

Simplify the equation:

(27(12 + 96d) / 88) + 36d = 71

Multiply both sides by 88 to eliminate the fraction:

243 + 2592d + 3168d = 6232

Combine like terms:

4520d = 3989

Divide both sides by 4520:

d = 3989 / 4520

d = 0.882

Now that we have found d, we can find u:

u = (12 + 96(0.882)) / 88

u = (12 + 85.248) / 88

u = 97.248 / 88

u = 1.104

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of f's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 2:
40n - 36f = 18

2) Multiply the second equation by 18:
54n - 36f = 1260

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate f:

(54n - 40n) - (36f - 36f) = 1260 - 18
14n = 1242

Now, divide by 14:

n = 1242/14
n = 89

Now that we have the value of n, substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of f. We'll use the first equation:

20n - 18f = 9
20(89) - 18f = 9
1780 - 18f = 9

Subtract 1780 from both sides:

-18f = -1771

First, we can solve the first equation for l:

l = (133 - 97j) / 7

Now, substitute this expression for l into the second equation:

22j + 37((133 - 97j) / 7) = 76

Multiply both sides of the equation by 7 to eliminate the fraction:

154j + 37(133 - 97j) = 532

Expand and simplify the equation:

154j + 4933 - 3577j = 532

Combine like terms:

-2103j = -4401

Divide both sides by -2103:

j = 4401 / 2103

j = 2

Now that we have found j, we can find l by substituting j into one of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:

7l + 97(2) = 133

7l + 194 = 133

Subtract 194 from both sides:

7l = -61

Divide both sides by 7:

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of f's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 84:
168d - 3884f = 4428
2) Multiply the second equation by 46:
368d + 3864f = 6118

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate f:

(368d + 3864f) - (168d - 3884f) = 6118 - 4428
368d + 3864f - 168d + 3884f = 6118 - 4428
200d + 7748f = 1690

Now, divide both sides by 200:

d + 38.74f = 8.45

Now, substitute this expression for d into one of the original equations. We'll use the first equation:

21d - 46f = 53
21(d + 38.74f) - 46f = 53
21(8.45) - 46f = 53
177.45 - 46f = 53

Now, subtract 53 from both sides:

177.45 - 46f - 53 = 0
-46f = -25.55

Now, divide both sides by -46:

f = 25.55/46
f = 0.55

Now that we have found f, we can substitute it back into the expression for d:

d + 38.74f = 8.45
d + 38.74(0.55) = 8.45
d + 21.29 = 8.45
d = 8.45 - 21.29

2) Now, add both equations to eliminate w:

3) Divide by 1102:

u = 8167/1102
u = 7.4

4) Now that we have the value of u, substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of w. We'll use the first equation:

74u + 11w = 116

Now, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate n:

First, we can solve the second equation for y:

y = (116 - 14z) / 60

Now, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:

Multiply both sides by 60 to eliminate the fraction:

83t = 45 + 58h

Next, we can multiply both sides of the second equation by 11 to get:

769h + 121t = 1374

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate the h variable:

769h - 83t = 1374 - 45
= 1329

Now, we can divide both sides by 83 to get:

h = (1329 - 83t) / 769

Now, we can substitute this expression for h into one of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:

83t - 58((1329 - 83t) / 769) = 45

To simplify this equation, we can multiply both sides by 769 to get rid of the fraction:

61957 - 9764t = 34965

Next, we can subtract 34965 from both sides to get:

-26992 = -9764t

Finally, we can divide both sides by -9764 to solve for t:

t = 26992 / 9764
= 2.77

Now that we have found t, we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find h. Let's use the second equation:

69h + 11(2.77) = 124

To solve for h, we can subtract 30.67 from both sides:

69h = 93.33

Finally, we can divide both sides by 69 to solve for h:

h = 93.33 / 69
= 1.35

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the second equation for h:

h = (12 * o + 9) / 16

Now, substitute this expression for h into the first equation:

(79 * ((12 * o + 9) / 16)) - (61 * o) = 9

Simplify the equation:

(946.5 * o + 693) - 61 * o = 9

Combine like terms:

885.5 * o = -684

Divide both sides by 885.5:

o = -684 / 885.5

o â‰ˆ -0.77

Now that we have the value of o, substitute it back into the expression for h:

h = (12 * (-0.77) + 9) / 16

h = (-9.24 + 9) / 16

h = 0.76 / 16

h â‰ˆ 0.0475

So, the values of o and h are approximately o â‰ˆ -0.77 and h â‰ˆ 0.0475.

First, we can solve the first equation for s:

s = (139 - 4y) / 56

Now, substitute this expression for s into the second equation:

65y - 90((139 - 4y) / 56) = 16

Multiply both sides by 56 to eliminate the fraction:

65y - 90(139 - 4y) = 16 * 56

Expand and simplify:

65y - 12570 + 360y = 896

Combine like terms:

425y = 12590

Divide by 425:

y = 12590 / 425

y = 29.5

Now that we have found y, substitute it back into one of the original equations to find s. We'll use the first equation:

4 * 29.5 + 56 * s = 139

Expand and simplify:

117 + 56s = 139

Subtract 117 from both sides:

56s = 22

2) Multiply the second equation by 4:

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate z:

(160d + 180z) - (1825d - 180z) = 648 - 3375
160d - 1825d = 648 - 3375

First, we can solve the second equation for 'a':

(42 * a) + (6 * o) = 75
42 * a = 75 - 6 * o
a = (75 - 6 * o) / 42

Now, substitute this expression for 'a' into the first equation:

(42 * o) + (24 * ((75 - 6 * o) / 42)) = 142

Simplify the equation:

42 * o + 24 * ((75 - 6 * o) / 42) = 142
42 * o + 24 * (75 / 42 - 6 * o / 42) = 142
42 * o + 24 * (75 / 42) - 24 * 6 * o / 42 = 142
42 * o + 18 - 24 * 6 * o / 42 = 142
42 * o + 18 - 12 * o = 142
30 * o + 18 = 142
30 * o = 142 - 18
30 * o = 124
o = 124 / 30
o = 4

Now that we have the value of 'o', we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of 'a'. We'll use the second equation:

(42 * a) + (6 * 4) = 75
42 * a + 24 = 75
42 * a = 75 - 24
42 * a = 51
a = 51 / 42
a = 1.21

First, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of r's in both equations are the same:

1) Multiply the first equation by 16 and the second equation by 2:

624*r - 32*p = 720 and 32*p - 168*r = 72

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the term with r:

624*r - 32*p - (32*p - 168*r) = 720 - 72

This simplifies to:

792*r = 648

Now, divide both sides by 792:

r = 648/792

r = 3/4

Now that we have the value of r, we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of p. We'll use the first equation:

39*(3/4) - 2*p = 45

Simplify the left-hand side:

29.25 - 2*p = 45

Subtract 29.25 from both sides:

d = (7 + 52w) / 23

Now, substitute this expression for 'd' into equation (2):

(64w) - (8 * ((7 + 52w) / 23)) = 58

Simplify the equation:

64w - (56/23) - (416w/23) = 58

Combine like terms:

(48w - 56/23) = 58

Multiply both sides by 23 to eliminate the fraction:

2) Multiply the second equation by 60:

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation:

47(71z + 60n) - 60(52z - 47n) = 47(184) - 60(19)
47(71z + 60n) - 60(52z - 47n) = 862 - 1140
47(71z + 60n) - 60(52z - 47n) = -278

Now, simplify the equation:

47(71z) + 47(60n) - 60(52z) + 60(47n) = -278
47(71z) - 60(52z) + 47(60n) + 60(47n) = -278
7z - 60z + 2820 + 2820 = -278
-53z + 5640 = -278

Now, add 278 to both sides:

2) Multiply the second equation by 70:

Now, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate e:

693z - 588e - (588e + 756z) = 1400 - 1584
693z - 588e - 588e - 756z = -84

From equation (1), we can express o in terms of f:

Now, substitute this expression for o into equation (2):

Multiply both sides by 26 to eliminate the fraction:

2197f + 1215 + 121f = 4366

Combine like terms:

2318f + 1215 = 4366

Subtract 1215 from both sides:

2318f = 3151

Divide both sides by 2318:

f = 3151 / 2318

f = 1.36 (approximately)

Now that we have found f, we can find o by substituting f back into the expression we found earlier:

o = (95 + 44(1.36)) / 26

o = (95 + 59.84) / 26

            Calculate the values of z and p using the following system of equations: 40*z - 20*p = 51
 6*z + 58*p = 165.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the first equation for z:

40*z - 20*p = 51
40*z = 51 + 20*p
z = (51 + 20*p) / 40

Now, substitute this expression for z into the second equation:

6*(51 + 20*p) / 40 + 58*p = 165

Multiply both sides by 40 to eliminate the fraction:

6*(51 + 20*p) + 58*p*40 = 165*40

Expand and simplify:

306 + 120*p + 2320*p = 6600

Combine like terms:

2446*p = 6294

Divide by 2446:

p = 6294 / 2446
p = 2.57 (approximately)

Now that we have found p, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find z. We'll use the first equation:

40*z - 20*p = 51
40*z - 20*2.57 = 51

Add 102.8 to both sides:

40*z = 153.8

Divide by 40:

z = 153.8 / 40
z = 3.845 (approximately)

### Answer: z â‰ˆ 3.845, p â‰ˆ 2.57.</pre>

            Find the values of s and f from the given system of equations:

(71 * s) - (89 * f) = 5 
(3 * f) + (10 * s) = 93.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can solve the second equation for f:

3f + 10s = 93
3f = 93 - 10s
f = (93 - 10s) / 3

Now, substitute this expression for f into the first equation:

(71s) - (89((93 - 10s) / 3)) = 5

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

213s - 267(93 - 10s) = 15

Expand and simplify:

213s - 24837 + 2670s = 15

Combine like terms:

1483s = 24952

Divide both sides by 1483:

s = 24952 / 1483
s = 16.8

Now that we have the value of s, we can find the value of f:

f = (93 - 10(16.8)) / 3
f = (93 - 168) / 3
f = -75 / 3
f = -25

### Answer: s = 16.8, f = -25</pre>
