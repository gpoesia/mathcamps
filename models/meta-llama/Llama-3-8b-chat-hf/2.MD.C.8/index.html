        Liam had $90 in twenties, tens and fives. He spent $81 on a new video game. How much money in dollars does Liam have left?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Liam had an unknown amount of twenties, tens, and fives. Let's say the number of twenties is x, the number of tens is y, and the number of fives is z. Since Liam had $90 in total, we can set up the equation: 20x + 10y + 5z = 90. He spent $81 on a new video game, so we subtract 81 from the total amount he had: 20x + 10y + 5z - 81 = 90 - 81 = 9. Since each twenty is worth $20, each ten is worth $10, and each five is worth $5, we can simplify the equation: 2x + y + z = 9. Since Liam spent all his money, he must have had 9 left after spending $81. Therefore, Liam has $9 left.

        Liam actually had $99 in twenties, tens and fives instead of $90. After spending $81 on a new video game, how much money in dollars does Liam have left now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Liam had $99 in twenties, tens, and fives. Let's say the number of twenties is x, the number of tens is y, and the number of fives is z. Since Liam had $99 in total, we can set up the equation: 20x + 10y + 5z = 99. He spent $81 on a new video game, so we subtract 81 from the total amount he had: 20x + 10y + 5z - 81 = 99 - 81 = 18. Since each twenty is worth $20, each ten is worth $10, and each five is worth $5, we can simplify the equation: 2x + y + z = 18. To find the number of twenties, tens, and fives, we can try different combinations of x, y, and z that add up to 18. One possible combination is x = 3, y = 1, and z = 1, which gives us: 2(3) + 1 + 1 = 7 + 1 + 1 = 9. Since Liam spent $81, he must have had 18 left after spending $81. Therefore, Liam has $18 left.

        Maria has 37 cents in nickels. After spending 12 cents on bubblegum, how much does she have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Maria has 37 cents in nickels, which means she has 37/5 = 7.4 nickels. Since you can't have a fraction of a nickel, she has 7 nickels.
Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so she has 7 x 5 = 35 cents.
After spending 12 cents on bubblegum, she has 35 - 12 = 23 cents left.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Lucy had 43 quarters initially.
She used some quarters to buy a toy, but the problem doesn't specify how many. Let's call the number of quarters she used &quot;x&quot;.
We know that Lucy had 17 quarters left after buying the toy, so we can set up the equation: 43 - x = 17.
To solve for x, we add 43 to both sides of the equation: 43 - x + 43 = 17 + 43.
This simplifies to: 86 - x = 60.
Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us: -x = -26.
Finally, multiplying both sides by -1 gives us: x = 26.
So Lucy used 26 quarters to buy the toy.
To find out how many quarters she has left, we subtract the number of quarters she used from the initial number of quarters: 43 - 26 = 17.

        Following up from the previous problem, Samantha decides to buy a toy that cost 34 quarters from her total savings. How many quarters will she have left after buying the toy?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Samantha initially has 85 quarters.
She spends 34 quarters to buy the toy.
To find the number of quarters left, we subtract the amount spent from the initial amount: 85 - 34 = &lt;&lt;85-34=51&gt;&gt;51.

        Let's revise Amy's sales from the original problem. Instead of selling 58 candles in the morning, she only sold one. She maintained her evening sales, selling another 27 candles. However, she still needed to pay a dollar for her parking fee. How much money did Amy earn in total after paying for parking with this revised sales?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Amy sells 1 candle in the morning and 27 candles in the evening, so she sells a total of 1 + 27 = 28 candles.
Each candle is sold for a dollar, so she earns a total of 28 dollars.
However, she uses one dollar to pay for parking, so she has 28 - 1 = 27 dollars left.

        Jacob saved $68 from his allowance and received $30 from his godmother for his birthday. After his birthday, he bought a new video game that cost him $70. How much money does Jacob have left after buying the video game?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Jacob had $68 initially.
He received $30 as a birthday present, so he now has $68 + $30 = $98.
He spent $70 on a video game, so he has $98 - $70 = $28 left.
