            In a neighborhood, there are 16 dogs living in different houses. One of the houses has 3 dogs. How many dogs are there in the neighborhood in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since one of the houses has 3 dogs, we need to subtract 3 from the total number of dogs to find the number of dogs in the remaining houses. There are 16 dogs in total, so we can set up the equation:

16 = 3 + x

where x is the number of dogs in the remaining houses. To solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 16 - 3
x = 13

So, there are 13 dogs in the remaining houses. Since one of the houses has 3 dogs, we add 3 to 13 to find the total number of dogs in the neighborhood:

13 + 3 = 16

However, this is the same as the original number of dogs, 16. This means that the 3 dogs in one of the houses are already included in the total number of dogs. Therefore, there are still 16 dogs in the neighborhood.

She bought 4 more pillows.
To find the total number of pillows, we add the number of pillows she started with to the number of pillows she bought: 1 + 4 = &lt;&lt;1+4=5&gt;&gt;5.
This shows that if Jenna had only 1 pillow to start with and bought 4 on her shopping trip, she would have had 5 pillows.

Now, let's go back to the original problem. Jenna started with 1 pillow and bought 14 more. To find the total number of pillows, we add the number of pillows she started with to the number of pillows she bought: 1 + 14 = &lt;&lt;1+14=15&gt;&gt;15.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Quincy starts with 9 toothpaste tubes.
She buys as many toothpaste tubes as she currently has, which is 9. So, she buys 9 more toothpaste tubes.
Now, she has 9 + 9 = 18 toothpaste tubes.
Then, she finds 2 more toothpaste tubes that she forgot she had in the drawer.
So, she now has 18 + 2 = 20 toothpaste tubes in total.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Samantha has 5 tent poles for her own tent. She needs an equal number for her friend's tent, so she needs 5 more tent poles.
In total, Samantha needs 5 + 5 = &lt;&lt;5+5=10&gt;&gt;10 tent poles for her own and friend's tents.
After setting up both tents, Samantha realizes she needs another set of 5 poles for a small storage tent. So, she needs 10 + 5 = &lt;&lt;10+5=15&gt;&gt;15 tent poles in total.
