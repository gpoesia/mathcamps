            Solve the following equation for the variable u: 122 = 92 + 28 * u

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation by evaluating the multiplication:

122 = 92 + 28 * u
122 = 92 + 28u

Next, we can subtract 92 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable:

122 - 92 = 28u
30 = 28u

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 28 to solve for u:

30 / 28 = u
u = 30/28

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To solve for i, we can start by adding 34 to both sides of the equation, which gets rid of the negative term:

42 = ((35 * i) - 34) + 34
42 = 35 * i

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 35 to isolate i:

42 / 35 = i
i = 42 / 35

Subtract 41 from both sides:
53 = 6r

53/6 = r
r = 53/6

64 = 19 * i

This simplifies to:

80 = 30 * q

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 30, which gives us:

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 24 to solve for w:

45/24 = w

w = 45/24

w = 1.875

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to simplify the right-hand side of the equation by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses.

14 * q = &lt;&lt;14 * q=14q&gt;&gt;

So, the equation becomes:

80 = 19 + (14q)

Next, we can subtract 19 from both sides of the equation to get:

80 - 19 = 19 + (14q) - 19

This simplifies to:

61 = 14q

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for q:

61/14 = 14q / 14

q = 61/14

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To solve for f, we can start by adding 76 to both sides of the equation, which gets rid of the negative term:

13 = ((86 * f) - 76)
13 + 76 = ((86 * f) - 76) + 76
89 = 86 * f

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 86 to isolate f:

89 = 86 * f
89/86 = f

159 - 62 = ((47 * e) + 62) - 62

This simplifies to:

97 = 47e

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 47 to solve for e:

97 / 47 = e

Subtract 50 from both sides:

145 - 50 = 50 + (91 * g) - 50

This simplifies to:

90 = 19 * q

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 19 to solve for q.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can start by simplifying the right-hand side of the equation by evaluating the expression inside the parentheses:

Now, we can set up the equation:

Subtract 62 from both sides to get:
