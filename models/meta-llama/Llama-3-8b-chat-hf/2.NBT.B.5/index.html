        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The rope maker originally had a rope that was 18 feet long. They added an extra foot to it, which means they added 1 foot to the original length.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: If the rope maker started with a rope that was 30 feet long, and then added an extra foot to it, we need to add the extra foot to the original length.

        Anna's closet has 23 dresses that she doesn't wear anymore, out of her total collection of 62 dresses. How many dresses does she have left that she still wears?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Anna has a total of 62 dresses, and 23 of them are not worn anymore. To find the number of dresses she still wears, we subtract the number of unworn dresses from the total number of dresses:

62 (total dresses) - 23 (unworn dresses) = 39

Anna has 39 dresses that she still wears.

        A pack of crayons contains 55 crayons. After using the pack for a while, 2 crayons are missing. How many crayons are left in the pack?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The pack originally had 55 crayons. After using it for a while, 2 crayons are missing, which means we need to subtract 2 from the original number of crayons.

55 - 2 = 53

So, there are 53 crayons left in the pack.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found that there are 53 crayons left in the pack. The art teacher adds 35 more crayons, which means we need to add 35 to the number of crayons already in the pack.

53 + 35 = 88

        On Tuesday, a group of researchers spotted 42 sharks near an island. On Wednesday, they spotted an additional 26 sharks around the same place. On Thursday, they spotted 32 more in the nearby waters, using a different technology. 

Sometime later, the same group of researchers reports that 59 of their earlier recorded numbers of sharks have migrated elsewhere. After considering this, how many sharks are now left in the area according to their accounting?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, the researchers spotted a total of 100 sharks (as calculated earlier).
After 59 sharks migrated elsewhere, the number of sharks left in the area is 100 - 59 = 41.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say John spent x dollars on the book. Since he was left with 39 dollars less than what he had initially, we can set up the equation:

53 - x = 39

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

53 = 39 + x

Subtracting 39 from both sides gives us:

14 = x

So John spent 14 dollars on the book. To find out how much money he has left in his wallet, we subtract 14 from the initial amount:

53 - 14 = 39

        Suppose instead of 43 sharks as initially counted in the first underwater area, the biologist had actually spotted 39 sharks. If the biologist still encountered an additional 27 in a different area, how many sharks did they encounter in total then?

        After Jake's 62 bubbles had popped out of the total 73 bubbles he had blown, his sister joined in the fun and started blowing bubbles too. She managed to blow 72 bubbles without any of them popping. How many bubbles were there in total, between Jake's remaining bubbles and the bubbles his sister blew?

We know that the difference between the larger number (88) and the missing number (x) is 78. This can be represented as an equation:

88 - x = 78

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

88 = x + 78

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the missing number is x.

We know that the difference between the larger number (88) and the missing number (x) is 88 - x.

We are given that the missing number is 61, so we can substitute x = 61 into the equation:

88 - 61 = ?

This simplifies to:

27 = ?

So, the difference between the larger number of 88 and the new missing number of 61 is 27.

        Following the previous problems, what if the store originally only received 30 additional HB pencils in the shipment, instead of 61. How many HB pencils would the store have in total then?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The store initially has 23 HB pencils.
The store receives a new shipment of 30 additional HB pencils.
To find the total number of HB pencils, we add the initial amount to the new shipment: 23 + 30 = &lt;&lt;23+30=53&gt;&gt;53.

        After realizing the little prank his sister pulled on him, Ben sets off to retrieve his notes. He manages to find and get back some of his notes. After checking his collection, he realises that he now has just as many notes as he initially did minus the ones he has remaining after his sister's prank. How many notes did Ben manage to retrieve from his sister?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

After his sister took 24 notes, he was left with 30 notes.
Now, he has retrieved some notes and has 54 - 24 = 54 notes again.
The number of notes he retrieved is the difference between the number of notes he has now and the number of notes he had after his sister's prank: 54 - 30 = 24.
