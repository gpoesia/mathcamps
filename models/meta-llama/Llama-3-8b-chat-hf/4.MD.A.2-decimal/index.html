        A car travels a distance of 775.644 miles on 43.6 gallons of fuel. How many miles does the car travel per gallon of fuel?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the miles per gallon, we need to divide the total distance traveled (775.644 miles) by the total amount of fuel consumed (43.6 gallons).

775.644 miles ÷ 43.6 gallons = 17.77 miles per gallon

        If the car's fuel efficiency standard is 27 miles per gallon but it is falling short and only managing to travel the distance calculated in the previous problem per gallon, by how much is it falling short of the fuel efficiency standard?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The car's actual fuel efficiency is 17.77 miles per gallon, which is the distance it travels per gallon. The standard fuel efficiency is 27 miles per gallon.

To find the difference, subtract the actual fuel efficiency from the standard fuel efficiency:

27 miles/gallon - 17.77 miles/gallon = 9.23 miles/gallon

This means the car is falling short of the fuel efficiency standard by 9.23 miles per gallon.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: If the car initially had 49 gallons of fuel instead of 43.6 gallons, and it still traveled 775.644 miles, we can calculate the new miles per gallon as follows:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Susan had 48 dollars initially.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Susan initially had 11 dollars in her purse.
She found 6 dollars in her desk draw, so she added that to her purse: 11 + 6 = 17 dollars.
Then, she earned 23 dollars from doing chores, so she added that to her purse: 17 + 23 = 40 dollars.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The car consumes 615 liters of gas every 41 hours. To find the rate at which the car consumes gas, we can divide the amount of gas consumed (615 liters) by the time taken (41 hours). This gives us the rate of consumption as 615/41 liters per hour.

To find the amount of gas consumed in 30 hours, we can multiply the rate of consumption by the time taken: (615/41) x 30 = 450 liters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The car has consumed gas for 30 hours, and it would have consumed 450 liters of gas in that time (as calculated earlier). However, it lost 46.33 liters of gas due to the leak. To find the amount of gas remaining, we subtract the amount lost from the total amount consumed: 450 - 46.33 = 403.67 liters.

        Continuing from the previous problem, what if the car's fuel consumption rate was instead 615 liters every 23 hours? How many liters of gas would it consume in 30 hours at this new rate?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The car consumes 615 liters of gas every 23 hours. To find the rate at which the car consumes gas, we can divide the amount of gas consumed (615 liters) by the time taken (23 hours). This gives us the rate of consumption as 615/23 liters per hour.

To find the amount of gas consumed in 30 hours, we can multiply the rate of consumption by the time taken: (615/23) x 30 = 795 liters.

        You bought a car for $303.5756 and you decided to pay it off in 19.51 monthly installments. After calculating, you find the amount for each monthly installment. If you add $41.35 to your monthly installments for car insurance, what is your total monthly payment for your car and insurance?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the amount for each monthly installment, we need to divide the total amount paid ($303.5756) by the number of installments (19.51). We can do this by converting the decimal to a fraction: 19.51 = 1951/100.

Now, we can divide the total amount by the number of installments:

$303.5756 ÷ (1951/100) = $15.55

So, the monthly installment is $15.55.

To find the total monthly payment for the car and insurance, we add the monthly installment to the car insurance amount:

$15.55 + $41.35 = $56.90

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the total cost of the car is now $41, we can divide it by the number of installments (19.51) to find the monthly installment:

$41 ÷ (1951/100) = $2.09

So, the monthly installment is $2.09.

To find the total monthly payment for the car and insurance, we add the monthly installment to the car insurance amount:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the average mileage per gallon of gas used, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the total amount of gas used.

First, we can round the total distance traveled to 436 miles, since the extra digits are just due to rounding errors.

Total distance traveled = 436.23179999999996 miles
Total gas used = 17 gallons

Average mileage per gallon = Total distance traveled ÷ Total gas used

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the distance traveled in one hour, we can divide the total distance traveled (67.66 miles) by the total time taken (17 hours).

        The delivery driver now realizes that his shift was 18 hours long, not 17 hours, for the 67.66-mile long journey. How far does he now calculate his average distance driven per hour?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

        John saw a sale on his favorite books and decided to buy 8 books using the money he had in his wallet. If each book cost the amount equal to the money he had in his wallet, how much did he spend on books?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John had $59.03 in his wallet.
Each book costs the same amount as the money he had in his wallet, which is $59.03.
He bought 8 books, so he spent 8 x $59.03 = $472.24 on books.

        John initially thought he had $29.33 in his wallet, but it turns out he only had $5. After spending $7.3 out of his $37 bank balance, he again added the remaining money from his bank account to his wallet. Now, how much money does he have in his wallet?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John initially had $5 in his wallet, not $29.33.
He spent $7.30 out of $37 from his bank account, so he has $37 - $7.30 = $29.70 left in his bank account.
He adds this remaining amount to his wallet, so he now has $5 + $29.70 = $34.70 in his wallet.

        Sarah has earned $38 per day over her first job. After several months, she managed to save up $24.71 for every $1 she earned. Additionally, she has $11.6 in her piggy bank from before she started working. How much money does she have in total?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Sarah earned $38 per day. Let's calculate the total amount she earned: $38/day * number of days = total amount earned.
Since we don't know the exact number of days, let's convert the amount she saved to a fraction of her total earnings: $24.71 / $38 = 0.6487 (approximately).
This means she saved 64.87% of her total earnings. Let's calculate her total earnings: $38 * x = total earnings, where x is the number of days.
We know she saved $24.71 for every $1 she earned, so her total savings is: $24.71 * 0.6487 = $16.03 (approximately).
Adding her total savings to her initial $11.60, we get: $16.03 + $11.60 = $27.63.

Then, his grandma gave him an extra $27.4.
To find the total amount of money Mason has now, we add the previous total and the extra gift: $65.4 + $27.4 = &lt;&lt;65.4+27.4=92.8&gt;&gt;92.8.
