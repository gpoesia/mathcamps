            A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The company has 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. To find the number of packs needed, we divide the number of socks by the number of socks per pack: 2840/40 = 71. So, they need 71 more packs. Adding this to the 93 packs they already have, they will have a total of 93 + 71 = 164 packs.
After receiving another shipment of 70 packs, they will have a total of 164 + 70 = 234 packs. However, they had to return 8 packs due to quality issues, so they will have 234 - 8 = 226 packs.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of pairs of ice skates each store receives, we need to divide the total number of pairs (6806) by the number of stores (82).

6806 Ã· 61 = 111.8

Since you can't divide ice skates into fractions, we round down to the nearest whole number.

            Continuing with the scenario of the cheese factory, let's say the factory now operates 31 days a month rather than 85 days, with the overall cheese production still being 5865 kg. How much cheese would now be produced each day?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the total amount of cheese produced remains the same (5865 kg), we can set up a proportion to find the new daily production:

Total cheese produced / Number of days = Daily cheese production

5865 kg / 31 days = x kg/day

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 31:

x = 5865 kg Ã· 31 days
x = 189 kg/day

            A toy car battery lasts 16 hours. However, if the car's lights are used, the battery life decreases by the equivalent of 36 divided by 9 hours. Assuming the toy car is run with the lights on for 12 full weeks, each week considered to be 60 hours, how long did the battery last?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The battery lasts 16 hours initially. If the lights are used, the battery life decreases by 36/9 = 4 hours. So, the battery life with lights on is 16 - 4 = 12 hours.
The toy car is run with lights on for 12 weeks, each week being 60 hours. So, the total hours with lights on is 12 x 60 = 720 hours.
The battery life with lights on is 12 hours, so the battery will last for 720/12 = 60 times.
The initial battery life is 16 hours, so the total battery life is 60 x 16 = 960 hours.

            A train travels at a speed of 68 mph but due to certain restrictions, it had to slow down to 28 mph. Considering the travel time of 21 hours, calculate the impact on the total distance traveled by the train.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The train travels at 68 mph for some time, let's call it x hours. The distance traveled during this time is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 68 x x = 68x

2. The train then slows down to 28 mph and travels for the remaining time, which is 21 - x hours. The distance traveled during this time is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 28 x (21 - x)

3. The total distance traveled by the train is the sum of the distances traveled during these two periods:

Total Distance = 68x + 28(21 - x)

We know that the total time taken by the train is 21 hours, so we can set up the equation:

x + (21 - x) = 21

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 10.5

So, the train travels at 68 mph for 10.5 hours and at 28 mph for 10.5 hours.

4. Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled by the train:

Total Distance = 68(10.5) + 28(10.5)
= 713 + 294
= 1007

The impact on the total distance traveled by the train due to slowing down is a reduction of:

1007 - (68 x 21) = 1007 - 1426 = -419 miles

The train travels 419 miles less than it would have if it had maintained its original speed of 68 mph for the entire 21 hours.

### Answer: -419 miles.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Mandy initially had 18 building blocks. She received 55 more, so the total number of blocks she has is 18 + 55 = 73.
Then, she decided to multiply the total number of blocks by the initial number she had, which is 18. So, she multiplied 73 by 18, which gives 1314.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The fairy's original rate is 4332 milligrams every 76 minutes. To find the rate per minute, we divide by 76: 4332/76 = 57 milligrams per minute.
After reducing the rate by 44 milligrams, the new rate is 57 - 44 = 13 milligrams per minute.
In 22 minutes, the fairy will sprinkle 13 x 22 = &lt;&lt;13*22=286&gt;&gt;286 milligrams of magical dust.

1.5 Ã— 990 = 1485

So, the phone manufacturer produces 1485 phones in 33 hours. After adding 80 more phones to the production batch, the total number of phones produced is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of increments needed, we need to divide the total points required (3795) by the increment size (69).

3795 Ã· 69 = 55

Since we can't gain a fraction of an increment, we round up to the nearest whole number.

55 â†’ 56

So, the player needs 56 increments to gain the points required to complete the level.

            A certain dinosaur species laid eggs every 60 minutes. If they had been laying eggs for 1620 minutes straight, how many total eggs would they have laid?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The dinosaur species lays eggs every 60 minutes, so the number of eggs laid in 1 minute is 1.
The number of eggs laid in 60 minutes is 60.
The number of eggs laid in 1620 minutes is 1620/60 = 27.

            Following the previous scenario, suppose the paleontologists revised their calculations and found that the dinosaur species was actually laying eggs every 47 minutes, not 60 as originally thought. In that case, how many total eggs would the dinosaur have laid if it had been laying eggs for 1620 minutes straight?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The dinosaur species lays eggs every 47 minutes, so the number of eggs laid in 1 minute is 1/47.
The number of eggs laid in 47 minutes is 47.
The number of eggs laid in 1620 minutes is 1620/47 = 34.51 (round up to 35, since you can't lay a fraction of an egg).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The beachcomber collected 74 seashells per day for 42 days, which is a total of 74 x 42 = 3102 seashells.
Additionally, the beachcomber found 56 seashells that had been hidden in the sand.
The total number of seashells the beachcomber has is 3102 + 56 = 3158.
