            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's use subtraction to find the number of young dolphins. The trainer has a total of 10 dolphins, and 3 of them are mature dolphins. To find the number of young dolphins, we subtract the number of mature dolphins from the total number of dolphins:

10 (total dolphins) - 3 (mature dolphins) = 7

So, the trainer has 7 young dolphins.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of candies her friend gave her is x. Since Sarah had 4 candies initially and then had a total of 10 candies, we can set up the equation:

4 + x = 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 4
x = 6

So, her friend gave her 6 candies.

So, there are 6 books that are not fantasy novels, and some of these might be science fiction novels. However, the problem doesn't provide information about the other genres, so we can't determine the exact number of science fiction novels.

Since he found 10 more honey jars, the total number of honey jars he has now is x + 10 = 16.

To find the number of honey jars Barry the bear had initially, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

x + 10 = 16
x = 16 - 10
x = 6

So, Barry the bear had 6 honey jars initially.

            A robot needs 10 units of energy to start and run for 1 hour, but to keep running for another hour, it needs additional 'w' units of energy. If the total energy required for the robot to run for 2 hours is 13 units, how many extra units of energy does it need to run for the additional hour?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

1. The robot needs 10 units of energy to start and run for 1 hour, so the energy required for the first hour is 10 units.
2. To keep running for another hour, it needs additional 'w' units of energy, so the energy required for the second hour is 10 + w units.
3. The total energy required for the robot to run for 2 hours is 13 units, so we can set up the equation: 10 + (10 + w) = 13

Simplifying the equation, we get: 20 + w = 13

Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get: w = -7

So, the robot needs -7 units of energy to run for the additional hour. Note that this is a negative value, which means the robot actually loses energy to run for the additional hour.

To solve for w, we can subtract 10 from both sides:

w = 11 - 10
w = 1

So, Tim received 1 rose.

Since the wind speed increases by 3 miles per hour from the morning to the afternoon, the wind speed in the afternoon is x + 3 miles per hour.

We know that the wind speed in the afternoon is 10 miles per hour, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3 = 10

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us:

x = 7

So, the wind speed in the morning was 7 miles per hour.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x = 4

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say x geese arrived at the pond by the end of the day. Since there were 10 geese seen at the pond in the morning, the total number of geese at the pond by the end of the day is 10 + x.
We know that the total number of geese at the farm is 19, so we can set up the equation: 10 + x = 19.
To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: x = 19 - 10.
x = 9.

To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 7
x = 3

So, there were 3 letters in James' mailbox originally.

This means the number of pillows he had initially (10) plus the number of pillows he bought (x) is equal to the total number of pillows he has now (11).

We can set up an equation to represent this:

10 + x = 11

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

x = 11 - 10
x = 1

So, John bought 1 pillow.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The top part of the slide is 10 feet tall, and the total height of the slide is 12 feet. To find the length of the lower section, we subtract the height of the top part from the total height:

12 feet (total height) - 10 feet (top part) = 2 feet

So, the length of the lower section of the slide is 2 feet.

Since each package contains 10 marshmallows, x must be a multiple of 10. The closest multiple of 10 to 3 is 10, so Lila had 10 marshmallows initially.

            John has a guitar with 10 strings. Some of the strings broke, but you know that being left with (e + 6) strings meant the guitar still had 10 strings. What is the value of e, i.e., how many strings were broken?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of strings that broke is e. Then, the number of strings left is 10 - e. We know that the number of strings left is (e + 6), so we can set up the equation:

10 - e = e + 6

Simplifying the equation, we get:

10 - e = e + 6

Subtracting e from both sides gives:

10 = 2e + 6

Subtracting 6 from both sides gives:

4 = 2e

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

2 = e

So, the value of e is 2, which means 2 strings were broken.

We know that his total points scored at the end of the first round was 10, so we can set up the equation 4 + x = 10.
To solve for x, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 10 - 4.

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides:

x = 16 - 10
x = 6

So, we need to add 6 grapes to the bunch initially containing 10 grapes to make it 16.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of people who arrived at the party is x. Since there were 9 people already present, the total attendance is 9 + x. We know that the total attendance is 10, so we can set up the equation:

9 + x = 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 9
x = 1

So, 1 person arrived at the party.

            A dragon had 10 gold coins in his cave. But a brave knight came and took 8 coins. How many gold coins does the dragon have left now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The dragon initially had 10 gold coins. The brave knight took 8 coins, which means the dragon lost 8 coins. To find the number of coins the dragon has left, we subtract 8 from 10: 10 - 8 = 2.

The dragon has 2 gold coins left now.

            A dolphin trainer currently has 9 dolphins and later acquires some additional ones, making the total number of dolphins in his care 10. How many dolphins did the trainer acquire?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of dolphins the trainer acquired is x. The trainer initially had 9 dolphins, and after acquiring x dolphins, he had a total of 10 dolphins. This can be represented by the equation:

9 + x = 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 9
x = 1

So, the trainer acquired 1 dolphin.

            A butterfly starts her day with 6 flowers and visits r more in the afternoon to get her total daily quota of 10 flowers. How many more flowers does she need to visit in the afternoon?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The butterfly starts with 6 flowers and needs a total of 10 flowers. To find out how many more flowers she needs to visit, we subtract the number of flowers she already has from her total daily quota:

10 (total daily quota) - 6 (flowers already visited) = 4

So, the butterfly needs to visit 4 more flowers in the afternoon.
