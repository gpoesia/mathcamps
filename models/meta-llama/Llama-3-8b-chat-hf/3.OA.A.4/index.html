            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of castles being built is x. Since each castle requires 5 builders, the total number of builders required is 5x. We know that there are 15 builders in total, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 15

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:

x = 15/5

x = 3

So, the king is building 3 castles.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the watch manufacturer worked for x hours. Since they can produce 8 watches every hour, the total number of watches they produced is 8x.
We know that the total number of watches they produced is 48, so we can set up the equation 8x = 48.
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8, which gives us x = 48/8.
x = 6, so the watch manufacturer worked for 6 hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the rider rode the scooter for x hours. Since the shop charges 7 dollars per hour, the total cost would be 7x dollars. We know that the total cost is 35 dollars, so we can set up the equation 7x = 35.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7, which gives us x = 35/7.

x = 5

So, the rider rode the scooter for 5 hours.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of bracelets in each multiple is x. Since each collection consists of identical bracelets in distinct multiples of 11, we can write the number of bracelets in each collection as 11x, 22x, 33x, ..., 77x.

We know that the total number of bracelets is 77, so we can set up the equation:

11x + 22x + 33x + ... + 77x = 77

Combine like terms:

x(11 + 22 + 33 + ... + 77) = 77

Factor the left-hand side:

x(11(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 7)) = 77

Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

x(11(7)(8)/2) = 77

Simplify:

x(77) = 77

Divide both sides by 77:

x = 1

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the vertical height of the tent be h feet.

Since the diagonal length is 14 feet, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the diagonal length to the vertical height:

âˆš(hÂ² + hÂ²) = 14

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2hÂ² = 14Â²

hÂ² = 196/2

hÂ² = 98

Taking the square root of both sides:

h = âˆš98

h â‰ˆ 9.85 feet

So, the vertical height of the tent is approximately 9.85 feet.

### Answer: 9.85 feet.</pre>

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11:

x = 22/11

x = 2

Since it rotates at half the speed on a breezeless day, it rotates at x/2 revolutions per minute on a breezeless day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the customer rented the roller skates for x hours. Since the charge is 5 dollars per hour, the total charge would be 5x dollars. We know the total charge was 15 dollars, so we can set up the equation 5x = 15.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5, which gives us x = 15/5.

x = 3

So, the customer rented the roller skates for 3 hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the watches are divided equally into display cases, and each display case contains 10 watches, we can set up the equation:

Number of watches = Number of display cases Ã— Number of watches per display case
50 = x Ã— 10

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10:

x = 50 Ã· 10
x = 5

So, there are 5 display cases in the store.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of play sections is x. Since each play section has 7 monkeys, the total number of monkeys is 7x. We know that the total number of monkeys is 35, so we can set up the equation:

7x = 35

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 7:

x = 35/7

x = 5

So, there are 5 play sections in the jungle gym.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of door panels is x. Since each door panel weighs 5kg, the total weight of all door panels is 5x kg. We know that the total weight is 45kg, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:

x = 45/5

x = 9

So, there are 9 door panels in the warehouse.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since each cloud has the same weight, we can represent the weight of one cloud as w. The total weight of all 9 clouds is the sum of their individual weights, which is 9.

We can set up an equation: w + w + w + w + w + w + w + w + w = 9

Combine like terms: 9w = 9

Divide both sides by 9: w = 1

So, the weight of one cloud is 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the original speed of the train is x km/hr.

Since the speed is halved, the new speed is x/2 km/hr.

We know that the new speed is 3 km/hr, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 3 Ã— 2

x = 6

So, the original speed of the train is 6 km/hr.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of days it took to sell 84 compasses is x.
The compass maker sells 12 compasses each day, so the total number of compasses sold is 12x.
We know that the total number of compasses sold is 84, so we can set up the equation 12x = 84.
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 12, which gives us x = 84/12.
x = 7, so it took the compass maker 7 days to sell 84 compasses.

Since 3 pillows can be stitched from this fabric, the amount of fabric used is equal to 3 times the number of pillows.

We know that dividing the fabric by 6 gives us the number of pillows, so we can set up the equation:

            There are 60 lions in a national park. If the park authority decides to evenly distribute these lions into different regions such that each region has exactly 10 lions, how many regions would there be?

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of regions, we need to divide the total number of lions (60) by the number of lions each region will have (10).

60 Ã· 10 = 6

So, there would be 6 regions.

            For an upcoming clothing sale, a store decides to discount their jackets. After the discount, each jacket costs 6 dollars. If the original price was &quot;d&quot; dollars and it's now 1/5th of its original price, what was the original price of the jacket?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the original price of the jacket was &quot;d&quot; dollars. After the discount, the price of the jacket is 1/5th of its original price, which is d/5 dollars. We know that the discounted price is 6 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

d/5 = 6

To solve for d, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

d = 6 Ã— 5
d = 30

So, the original price of the jacket was 30 dollars.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say there are x giraffes in the zoo. Each giraffe eats 7 pounds of food, so the total amount of food consumed is 7x pounds. We know that the total amount of food consumed is 28 pounds, so we can set up the equation:

7x = 28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 7:

x = 28/7

x = 4

So, there are 4 giraffes in the zoo.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: If each zone contains 6 starfish, and there are 30 starfish in total, we can divide 30 by 6 to find the number of zones:

30 Ã· 6 = 5

So, there are 5 zones in total.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The astronaut has 88 hours of oxygen in his tank. He can use this tank for 8 days. To find out how many hours of oxygen the tank provides each day, we need to divide the total hours of oxygen by the number of days.

88 hours Ã· 8 days = 11 hours
