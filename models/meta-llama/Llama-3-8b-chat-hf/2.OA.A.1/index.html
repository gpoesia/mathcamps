He has 42 roller skates for children.
To find the number of roller skates for adults, subtract the number of roller skates for children from the total number of roller skates: 70 - 42 = 28.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of dogs that relocated from the town is x. Initially, there were 98 dogs, and after some dogs relocated, there were 73 dogs left. This means that the number of dogs that relocated is the difference between the initial number of dogs and the number of dogs left.

98 - 73 = x

x = 25

So, 25 dogs relocated from the town.

            Captain Bruce's pirate ship weighs 78 tons with all the crew members and cargo. However, once they remove the cargo which weighs 74 tons, the weight of the ship with just the crew is needed. What is the weight of the pirate ship with just the crew (in tons)?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total weight of the ship and crew is 78 tons. The weight of the cargo is 74 tons. To find the weight of the ship with just the crew, we subtract the weight of the cargo from the total weight.

78 (total weight) - 74 (weight of cargo) = 4

So, the weight of the pirate ship with just the crew is 4 tons.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of jewels the subject found and presented to the princess is x. The princess initially had 14 jewels, and after receiving the new jewels, she had a total of 49 jewels. This means that the number of jewels she had initially (14) plus the number of jewels the subject found (x) is equal to the total number of jewels she has now (49).

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

14 + x = 49

To solve for x, we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:

x = 49 - 14
x = 35

So, the subject found and presented 35 jewels to the princess.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say John sold x bananas to his friend. We know that John had 36 bananas initially and had 34 bananas left after selling some to his friend. This means that the number of bananas John had left is the initial number minus the number he sold: 36 - x = 34.

We can solve for x by subtracting 34 from both sides: 36 - x = 34 =&gt; -x = -2.

Then, we can add x to both sides to get: x = 2.

So, John sold 2 bananas to his friend.

We know that the total number of songs is 40, and if we subtract the number of romantic songs, we're left with 20 songs.

So, we can set up the equation:

40 - x = 20

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

40 = x + 20

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:

20 = x

So, there are 20 romantic songs in the album.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Craig started with 83 hit points and ended up with 32 hit points. To find out how many hit points he lost, we need to subtract his final hit points from his initial hit points.

83 (initial hit points) - 32 (final hit points) = 51

Craig lost 51 hit points in the attack.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of pencils the teacher added is x. We know that the total count of pencils after the teacher added some pencils is 56. Since there were 53 pencils initially, the total count of pencils after addition is the sum of the initial count and the number of pencils added: 53 + x = 56.

To find the number of pencils added, we can subtract 53 from both sides of the equation: x = 56 - 53 = 3.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of doors already installed is x. Since there are 44 doors in total, the number of doors yet to be installed is 44 - x. We know that 7 doors are yet to be installed, so we can set up the equation:

44 - x = 7

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

44 = x + 7

Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us:

37 = x

So, there are 37 doors already installed in the mansion.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the original angle of the sun above the horizon is 'j' degrees.

We know that decreasing the angle by 24 degrees makes it 52 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

j - 24 = 52

To solve for j, we can add 24 to both sides of the equation:

j = 52 + 24

j = 76

So, the original angle of the sun above the horizon was 76 degrees.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the hat maker originally had x hats. After selling 46 hats, he is left with 32 hats, which means he sold x - 32 hats. Since he sold 46 hats, we can set up the equation:

x - 32 = 46

To solve for x, we can add 32 to both sides of the equation:

x = 46 + 32

x = 78

So, the hat maker originally had 78 hats.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the initial amount of water in the tank is g gallons.

Since 3 gallons were removed, the remaining amount of water is g - 3 gallons.

We know that the remaining amount of water is 40 gallons, so we can set up the equation:

g - 3 = 40

To solve for g, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation:

g = 40 + 3

g = 43

So, the initial amount of water in the tank was 43 gallons.

After 21 apples fell from the trees, the number of apples left is x - 21.

We know that there are 49 apples left, so we can set up the equation:

To solve for x, we can add 21 to both sides of the equation:

x = 70

x = 52 + 5

x = 57

So, Lily has 57 dolls in total.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of sheets the teacher initially had is 'a'. After using 60 stickers, she has 2 sheets left. This means that the total number of stickers she had initially is equal to the number of stickers she used (60) plus the number of stickers in the 2 sheets she has left.

Since each sheet has 25 stickers (assuming standard sticker sheets), the number of stickers in 2 sheets is 2 x 25 = 50. So, the total number of stickers the teacher had initially is 60 + 50 = 110.

Since each sheet has 25 stickers, the number of sheets the teacher initially had is 110 / 25 = 4.4. Since you can't have a fraction of a sheet, the teacher initially had 4 sheets of star stickers.

After eating 43 strawberries, the number of strawberries left is j - 43 = 13.

To find the initial number of strawberries, we can add 43 to the number of strawberries left:

j = 13 + 43

j = 56

96 - x = 51

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

96 = 51 + x

Subtracting 51 from both sides gives us:

45 = x

So, Emily gave away 45 toys.

We know that the total number of toothbrushes initially was 99, and after distributing x toothbrushes, we are left with 20. This means that the number of toothbrushes initially minus the number of toothbrushes distributed is equal to the number of toothbrushes left, which is 20.

So, we can set up the equation: 99 - x = 20

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation: 99 = x + 20

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the initial number of students on the school bus is x.

After 17 students alighted from the bus, there are 56 students still seated. This means that the number of students remaining on the bus is x - 17 = 56.

To find the initial number of students, we can add 17 to both sides of the equation:

x - 17 + 17 = 56 + 17

This simplifies to:

x = 73

57 + x = 72

To solve for x, we can subtract 57 from both sides of the equation:

x = 72 - 57
x = 15

So, the farmer harvested 15 oranges from his other tree.
