            A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, the biologist counted 35 penguins on the small ice floe.
Then, she counted 598 penguins divided evenly among 26 ice floes, which is 598/26 = 23 penguins per ice floe.
After returning to the first place, the penguin population increased by 49, so the total number of penguins became 35 + 49 = 84.
She decided to take 33 more penguins into account, so the total number of penguins became 84 + 33 = 117.
However, she had to subtract 10 from her calculations, so the total number of penguins became 117 - 10 = 107.
Finally, she added in the penguins she'd left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks, so the total number of penguins became 107 + 20 + 14 = 141.

            At the zoo, there were 2 trips being hosted. Each trip was allowed to see 2 animals. However, each animal had 3 baby animals with them, making the number of animals seen per trip multiplied by 3. If each baby animal could be photographed 21 times, how many photos could be taken in total? Also, if 34 photos were spoiled and unusable out of the entire batch, but guests were given the opportunity to take an additional 30 photos later, how many usable photos would there be in total?

Since there are 2 trips, the total number of animals seen is 2 x 6 = 12 animals. Each baby animal can be photographed 21 times, so the total number of photos taken is 12 x 3 x 21 = 756 photos.

However, 34 photos are spoiled and unusable, so the number of usable photos is 756 - 34 = 722 photos.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Tommy's initial speed is 74/37 miles per hour. He slows down by 3 mph, so his speed becomes 74/37 - 3 = 71/37 miles per hour. Then, he speeds up to his initial speed again, which is 74/37 miles per hour.
To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken. Let's assume the total distance traveled is d miles.
Tommy's average speed is the total distance divided by the total time taken. The total time taken is the sum of the time taken at each speed.
The time taken at the initial speed is d / (74/37) = 37d/74 hours.
The time taken at the slowed-down speed is d / (71/37) = 37d/71 hours.
The time taken at the initial speed again is d / (74/37) = 37d/74 hours.
The total time taken is 37d/74 + 37d/71 + 37d/74 = 37d(1/74 + 1/71 + 1/74) = 37d(2/74) = 37d/37 = d hours.
Tommy's average speed is the total distance divided by the total time taken. The total distance is d miles, and the total time taken is d hours. So, Tommy's average speed is d/d = 1 mile per hour.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The female tiger had 26 cubs initially.
17 cubs did not survive, so the number of surviving cubs is 26 - 17 = 9.
6 of the surviving tigers moved to other territories, so the number of tigers remaining in the female tiger's territory is 9 - 6 = 3.

            A towel company initially produced 30 beach towels and 6 hand towels. They then gave away 7 towels for charity, which leaves a certain amount of towels. They then decided to produce 14 more towels to add to their current stock.

Initially, the company produced 30 beach towels and 6 hand towels, so they had a total of 30 + 6 = 36 towels.

After giving away 7 towels for charity, they were left with 36 - 7 = 29 towels.

Then, they produced 14 more towels, so they now have 29 + 14 = 43 towels.

The special batch of 13 towels for every towel left after the charity activity would be 13 x 29 = 377 towels. However, they deducted 19 towels from this batch, leaving 377 - 19 = 358 towels.

After removing 20 damaged towels from the premium collection, they were left with 358 - 20 = 338 towels.

Finally, they deducted 3 more towels from the remaining premium collection, leaving 338 - 3 = 335 towels.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Maria initially thought there were 46 oranges, but it turns out there were actually 49. So, the correct number of oranges is 49.
Maria took 16 oranges from the bowl, which means the number of oranges left is the correct number of oranges minus the number of oranges taken.
The correct number of oranges is 49.
The number of oranges taken is 16.
So, the number of oranges left is 49 - 16 = 33.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the height of the window frame. The height is calculated as the sum of 925 divided by 37 and 26 inches. This can be written as:

Height = 925 / 37 + 26

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

Height = (925 / 37) + 26
Height = 25 + 26
Height = 51

Now, we need to find the width of the window. The width is 11 inches greater than the height:

Width = Height + 11
Width = 51 + 11
Width = 62

Next, we need to find the circumference of the window. The circumference is calculated as the sum of twice the width and the height:

Circumference = 2 * Width + Height
Circumference = 2 * 62 + 51
Circumference = 124 + 51
Circumference = 175

Finally, we need to find the size of the glass required for the window. The size of the glass is calculated by subtracting 32 from the circumference:

Size of glass = Circumference - 32
Size of glass = 175 - 32
Size of glass = 143

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: With the new measurements, we need to recalculate the height of the window frame. The height is calculated as the sum of 925 divided by 37 and 16 inches. This can be written as:

Height = 925 / 37 + 16

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

Height = (925 / 37) + 16
Height = 25 + 16
Height = 41

Now, we need to find the width of the window. The width is 11 inches greater than the height:

Width = Height + 11
Width = 41 + 11
Width = 52

Next, we need to find the circumference of the window. The circumference is calculated as the sum of twice the width and the height:

Circumference = 2 * Width + Height
Circumference = 2 * 52 + 41
Circumference = 104 + 41
Circumference = 145

Finally, we need to find the size of the glass required for the window. The size of the glass is calculated by subtracting 32 from the circumference:

Size of glass = Circumference - 32
Size of glass = 145 - 32
Size of glass = 113

The pirate divides 323 emeralds amongst his crew of 19, so each crew member gets 323/19 = 17 emeralds.
The pirate multiplies these two shares to find the total share per crew member: 15 * 17 = 255.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's first find the weight of one piece of the original chocolate bar. Since the bar weighs 176 grams and is divided into 8 pieces, each piece weighs 176/8 = 22 grams.

For the second batch of chocolates, the chocolatier subtracts the weight of one piece (22 grams) from the original bar (176 grams), which leaves 176 - 22 = 154 grams. He then adds 26 grams of sugar, making the total weight of ingredients 154 + 26 = 180 grams.

For the third batch of chocolates, the total weight of ingredients is 38 grams of cocoa + 18 grams of milk = 56 grams.

The difference in the total weight of ingredients between the second and third batch of chocolates is 180 - 56 = 124 grams.

Adding the 390 rings to the 15 rings he had left, he now has 15 + 390 = 405 rings.
In addition, he made 7 platinum and 47 bronze rings, for a total of 7 + 47 = 54 rings.
Adding these to the 405 rings, the silversmith now has 405 + 54 = 459 rings in total.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Each row has 40 flowers, but only half of them grow properly, so each row has 40/2 = 20 flowers that grow properly.
There are 19 rows, so the total number of flowers in the rows is 19 x 20 = 380.
The gardener also plants 18 + 48 = 66 flowers in the small corners.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

Initially, there are 41 drops of red paint.

You add 13 drops of white paint, so the total number of drops is now 41 + 13 = 54.

You add the same amount of red paint as before, which is 41 drops, so the total number of drops is now 54 + 41 = 95.

You take a sample of 34 drops from this mixture, leaving 95 - 34 = 61 drops.

You then take away the same amount of the 34-drop sample that you took originally, which is 34 - 34 = 0 drops. This doesn't change the number of drops in the new mixture.

So, the new mixture has 61 drops of paint.

The weekly goal is the difference multiplied by 49, which is 5 * 49 = 245.
The staff prepared toy cars on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The total number of toy cars prepared by staff members is 12 * 9 * 5 = 540.
Adding 45 to the total number of toy cars prepared by staff members, we get 540 + 45 = 585.
On Friday, they prepared 31 additional toy cars, so the total number of toy cars prepared is 585 + 31 = 616.
The total number of toy cars made in this process is the sum of the weekly goal and the total number of toy cars prepared, which is 245 + 616 = 861.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, the company produces 36 marshmallow packs per hour. They add 6 more packs per hour, so the new hourly production is 36 + 6 = 42 packs per hour. However, they end up producing 43 less packs per hour than their goal, so the actual hourly production is 42 - 43 = 1 pack less than their goal. The goal is not explicitly stated, but we can find it by calculating the total daily production. The company adds 350 marshmallows to their daily production, which is distributed evenly over 7 hours. This means they add 350/7 = 50 marshmallows per hour. The new hourly production is 42 packs per hour, and they add 50 marshmallows per hour, so the total hourly production is 42 + 50 = 92 packs per hour.

In comparison, another wizard casts a spell that produces 460 glowing orbs in 20 days. What is the daily average here?

Now, let's assume that the difference in their daily averages times the second wizard's daily average is a magical constant represented by 'n'. Can you find out what 'n' is?

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the daily average for the first wizard, we divide the total number of lights (882) by the number of days (21):

882 Ã· 21 = 42

So, the first wizard casts an average of 42 lights per day.

For the second wizard, we divide the total number of orbs (460) by the number of days (20):

460 Ã· 20 = 23

So, the second wizard casts an average of 23 orbs per day.

Now, let's find the difference in their daily averages:

42 - 23 = 19

The daily average difference is 19. To find the magical constant 'n', we multiply the daily average difference by the daily average of the second wizard:

19 Ã— 23 = 437

            The previous problem had us determine the total number of police officers on duty under certain conditions. Now, let's imagine a slightly different scenario.

Like the previous situation, there were still 32 officers assigned to the north district and 33 sent to the south. The number for the downtown district was also the same, at 29. However, this time around, only 21 officers from the total force were transferred elsewhere instead of the original scenario's subtraction. A week later, an additional 22 officers, fewer than the 39 from the original scenario, were brought in for a different assignment. That same day, another addition of 14 officers was made, just like with the initial series of events.

            The distance between the Moon and the Earth changes throughout the month. On one particular day, the distance was 36 million kilometers but decreased by 19 million kilometers later in the month. Then it increased again by 11 million kilometers. If that distance, in millions of kilometers, times 19 minus 27 equals to a certain value, what is the value?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's break down the information given:
- The distance between the Moon and the Earth was initially 36 million kilometers.
- It decreased by 19 million kilometers, so the new distance is 36 - 19 = 17 million kilometers.
- Then, it increased by 11 million kilometers, so the final distance is 17 + 11 = 28 million kilometers.
- The problem asks us to find the value of (28 * 19) - 27.
- We can calculate this value by multiplying 28 by 19 and then subtracting 27:
(28 * 19) - 27 = 532 - 27 = 505

            In the scenario mentioned earlier about the distance between the Moon and the Earth: on one particular day, the distance was 36 million kilometers but decreased by 19 million kilometers later in the month. It further increased by 11 million kilometers.

Previously we calculated that distance, in millions of kilometers, times 19 and subtracted 27. But what if, instead of subtracting 27, we were to subtract 45? What would be the new value of the total distance?

28 * 19 - 45

We can calculate this value by multiplying 28 by 19 and then subtracting 45:

(28 * 19) - 45 = 532 - 45 = 487

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The first tiger took 2 steps of 9 meters each, which is 2 x 9 = 18 meters. Then it leaped 44 meters, so the total distance covered is 18 + 44 = 62 meters.

The second tiger covered a distance of 23 meters, then leaped, and then ran 46 meters. This is a total of 23 + ? + 46 = 69 meters. Then, it retraced the distance equal to the first tiger's steps and the leap, which is 18 meters. So, the second tiger covered a total distance of 69 - 18 = 51 meters.

            A gardener planted 13 Sunflowers in his garden. The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed. By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on and the spots needed, then he doubled that total for no particular reason. How many did he end up with?

Adding these to the initial 13 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers is 145 + 13 = 158.
The gardener also needed to calculate the number of spots for his orchids. This is given by 92 / 23 = 4.
The total number of plants the gardener worked on is the sum of the sunflowers and the spots, which is 158 + 4 = 162.

            A treasure chest contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds. Unfortunately, 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed. The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest. 

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

What is the value (m) of the remaining treasure?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first chest:
Natalia removed 39 fake stones. The total number of stones was 23 emeralds + 30 diamonds = 53 stones. So, 53 - 39 = 14 real stones left.
The value of the chest is g = y^2 - 37, where y is the number of real stones. Since there are 14 real stones, y = 14, and g = 14^2 - 37 = 196 - 37 = 159.

2. The second chest:
There were 540 rubies, which were shared equally among 45 pirates. Since 3 rubies were lost, the remaining number of rubies is 540 - 3 = 537. This is subtracted from the value of the first chest: 159 - 537 = -378.

3. The same chest:
There were 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count is s = 23 + 11 - 9 = 25. The value of the remaining treasure is m = -378 - 25 = -403.

            Following the princess' first game, her little sister, Princess Bella, wanted to join in with her own twist. Bella did as follows:

In the first round, Bella copied Anna and added the same two numbers: 7 and 10 together.

For the second round, sister Bella thought of the number 33. Just like Anna, She subtracted the result from the first round and then decreased it by 8.

In the final round, Princess Bella, like Anna, added the results from the first and second round. Then, she multiplied the sum by the result from her modified second round. What was the final result of Princess Bella's game?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: In the first round, Bella added 7 and 10, which gives us 17 (just like Anna).
In the second round, she subtracted the result from the first round (17) from 33, which gives us 33 - 17 = 16. Then, she subtracted 8 from that result, which gives us 16 - 8 = 8.
In the final round, she added the results from the first and second round, which gives us 17 + 8 = 25. Then, she multiplied the sum by the result from the second round, which gives us 25 * 8 = 200.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say Sam gave x dollars to Ellen. Then, Ellen had 15 + x dollars and Sam had 48 - x dollars. Since Sam had as much money as Ellen originally had after giving the money, we can set up the equation 48 - x = 15. Solving for x, we get x = 33. So Sam gave 33 dollars to Ellen. Ellen now has 15 + 33 = 48 dollars. Sam has 48 - 33 = 15 dollars. After getting 24 dollars from his brother, Sam has 15 + 24 = 39 dollars.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The hiker's original average was 900 miles in 36 days, so his original daily average was 900/36 = 25 miles.
After increasing his daily average to 16 miles, he will cover 16 miles in a day. Since he has already covered 25 miles in a day, he will cover the remaining distance in fewer days. Let's calculate the number of days he will take to cover the remaining distance:
Remaining distance = Total distance - distance covered so far
= 900 - (25 * 36)
= 900 - 900
= 0
Since he has already covered the total distance, he will take 0 days to cover the remaining distance. This means he will save 36 - 0 = 36 days.
After finding a shortcut, he saves an additional 4 days.
After a friendly traveller advises him of another path, he saves 40 days.
After good weather, he saves 21 days.
Total days saved = 36 + 4 + 40 + 21

After 43 goals were discounted, the player had 465 - 43 = 422 goals.
Then, 40 goals were awarded back to the player, so the player now has 422 + 40 = 462 goals.
Finally, 26 goals were deducted from the player, so the player ends up with 462 - 26 = 436 goals.

In total, she had 5 + 33 = 38 yarn balls before her third game.
She lost some of her balls in her third game due to a playful dog. Let's say she lost x balls. Then, she had 38 - x balls left.
She ended the game with a number of balls which is 25 times the difference between 45 and what she accumulated from the second game. So, she had 25(45 - 33) = 25(12) = 300 - 25(33) = 300 - 825 = -525 balls left.
This is impossible, because you can't have a negative number of balls. So, the cat must have lost all her balls in her third game. She had 38 balls initially, so she lost 38 balls.

            The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the calculations step by step:

1. Initially, the friend subtracted 32 from 37, added 42, and then subtracted 37. This can be written as:

37 - 32 + 42 - 37 = ?

First, subtract 32 from 37:

37 - 32 = 5

Then, add 42:

5 + 42 = 47

Finally, subtract 37:

47 - 37 = 10

So, the friend initially calculated that they needed 10 more squares for hours.

2. The friend then added 25 more squares for minutes and 28 more squares for seconds. They added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. This can be written as:

25 + 41 + 28 + 17 = ?

First, add 25 and 41:

25 + 41 = 66

Then, add 28:

66 + 28 = 94

Finally, add 17:

94 + 17 = 111

So, the friend calculated that they needed 111 more squares for minutes and seconds.

3. Since the friend didn't have enough material, they decided to reduce the total number of squares by 23. They added the initial result (10) to this reduced number. This can be written as:

10 + (111 - 23) = ?

First, subtract 23 from 111:

111 - 23 = 88

Then, add 10:

10 + 88 = 98

So, the friend needs a total of 98 squares to complete their quirky clock.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Your clockmaker friend continues to work at their quirky clock. They thought about the previous calculation for hour squares and realized they made a mistake. Instead of subtracting 37 from the sum of the unfinished hour squares (after adding 42), they should have subtracted only 13. 

So, they re-did the maths: subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted only 13 from that total.

Everything else remained the same, including the additional 25 squares for the minutes, followed by another 28 squares for the seconds. The following calculations also didn't change: they added 41 to 25, added 28 to the result and then added 17 to the final number.

But, just like before, they realized they still lack some material and decided to go on with their decision to reduce the total number of squares by 23. In the end, they added this reduced total to the newly calculated number for hours (after subtracting 13 instead of 37).

Can you help your friend figure out (again!) how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock project with the new calculation?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's redo the calculations:

1. The friend subtracted 32 from 37, added 42, and then subtracted 13. This can be written as:

37 - 32 + 42 - 13 = ?

First, subtract 32 from 37:

37 - 32 = 5

Then, add 42:

5 + 42 = 47

Finally, subtract 13:

47 - 13 = 34

So, the friend calculated that they needed 34 more squares for hours.

2. The friend then added 25 more squares for minutes and 28 more squares for seconds. They added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. This is the same calculation as before:

25 + 41 + 28 + 17 = ?

First, add 25 and 41:

25 + 41 = 66

Then, add 28:

66 + 28 = 94

Finally, add 17:

94 + 17 = 111

So, the friend calculated that they needed 111 more squares for minutes and seconds.

3. Since the friend didn't have enough material, they decided to reduce the total number of squares by 23. They added the new result (34) to this reduced number. This can be written as:

34 + (111 - 23) = ?

First, subtract 23 from 111:

111 - 23 = 88

Then, add 34:

34 + 88 = 122

So, the friend needs a total of 122 squares to complete their quirky clock.

Since the harvest period is 15 days, the total amount of oranges produced would be 14 x 15 = 210 pounds of oranges.
