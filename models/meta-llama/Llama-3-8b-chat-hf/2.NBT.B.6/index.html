Later, the number of guests increases by 62, so the new total is 72 + 62 = 134 guests.
Then, an additional group of 52 people join the party, so the final total is 134 + 52 = 186 guests.

            In a math class, students have to draw shapes based on certain numeric conditions. One student starts by rotating an angle to form 92 degrees.

Finally, he rotates it by another 66 degrees to form shape 'n'. What is the total degree measure of the rotations made to get shape 'n'?

To solve for x, we can add 59 to both sides of the equation:

Then, the total number of trees is the sum of the number of oak trees and the number of pine trees, which is 84 + x. We know that the number of pine trees adds 75 more to the total number of trees, so we can set up the equation:

84 + x = 84 + 75

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 75

So, there are 75 pine trees. To find the total number of trees, we add the number of oak trees and the number of pine trees:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since there are 84 oak trees, and we don't know the number of pine trees yet, let's call the number of pine trees x. Then, the total number of trees is the sum of the number of oak trees and the number of pine trees, which is 84 + x. We know that the number of pine trees adds 27 more to the total number of trees, so we can set up the equation:

84 + x = 84 + 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 27

So, there are 27 pine trees. To find the total number of trees, we add the number of oak trees and the number of pine trees:

84 + 27 = 111

In this design, the chest measurement is defined as the length added by 11 cm. The waist measurement is set as the sum of the two chest measurements. What is the waist measurement of this new shirt design in cm?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Jake initially has 69 balls. He buys 54 balls, which is less than the initial amount. He doubles that amount by buying the same number of balls, which means he buys 54 more balls.
To find the total number of balls Jake has now, we add the initial amount to the amount he bought: 69 + 54 = 123
Then, he doubles the amount he bought, which is 54, so he adds 54 more balls: 123 + 54 = 177

Later in the day, Kevin, her friend, comes over and makes an additional quantity of sandwiches such that in total, the sandwiches he makes added to Sarah's make up 33 more than the number of sandwiches made by Sarah.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say Sarah made x sandwiches. Since Kevin made an additional quantity of sandwiches such that in total, the sandwiches he makes added to Sarah's make up 33 more than the number of sandwiches made by Sarah, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 33) = 80 + x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 33 = 80

Subtracting 33 from both sides, we get:

2x = 47

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 23.5

Since Sarah made 80 sandwiches, and x is the number of sandwiches she made, we know that x = 80. However, we can't have a fraction of a sandwich, so we'll round x to the nearest whole number, which is 23.

Now, we know that Sarah made 23 sandwiches, and Kevin made 33 more than that. So, Kevin made:

23 + 33 = 56

sandwiches.

            Mike's left binocular lens can magnify objects from a distance of 30 miles away, and the right lens can magnify objects that are 56 miles away. He also has a telescope that can magnify objects from a distance of 67 miles away. What is the total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The left binocular lens can magnify objects from a distance of 30 miles away, and the right lens can magnify objects that are 56 miles away. This means that the minimum distance from which both lenses can magnify objects is 30 miles, and the maximum distance is 56 miles.
The telescope can magnify objects from a distance of 67 miles away, which is greater than the maximum distance of the binocular lenses. Therefore, the total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects is the range of the binocular lenses, which is 56 - 30 = 26 miles.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the land of the Wizarding World, one wand spells costs 50 magical crystals known as Quiblets. Quintus the wizard adds 5 Quiblets more to this to cast a slightly stronger spell. This amount is then topped up by 25 magical Quiblets to cast the most powerful spell. How many Quiblets does Quintus the wizard need to cast the most powerful spell?

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Quintus needs 50 Quiblets to cast the original spell.
He adds 5 more Quiblets to cast a slightly stronger spell, so he needs 50 + 5 = 55 Quiblets.
He then tops up this amount by 25 more Quiblets to cast the most powerful spell, so he needs 55 + 25 = 80 Quiblets.

            As an extension to the previous problem, let's say Quintus the wizard then decides to cast an ancient and profound spell. To cast this spell, he needs to gather an additional number of Quiblets equivalent to his most powerful spell, plus 50 more. How many Quiblets does Quintus the wizard need in total to cast this ancient spell?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Quintus needs 80 Quiblets to cast the most powerful spell.
He needs an additional number of Quiblets equivalent to his most powerful spell, plus 50 more, so he needs 80 + 50 = 130 Quiblets.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            As a variation to the previous problem, let's say the most powerful spell that Quintus the wizard wants to cast actually requires an additional 87 Quiblets on top of the slightly stronger spell, not just 25. How many Quiblets does he now need to cast this more demanding powerful spell?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Quintus needs 50 Quiblets to cast the original spell.
He adds 5 more Quiblets to cast a slightly stronger spell, so he needs 50 + 5 = 55 Quiblets.
He then needs an additional 87 Quiblets to cast the most powerful spell, so he needs 55 + 87 = 142 Quiblets.
