        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say there were x apples in the basket before the person added 166 apples. Then, the total number of apples in the basket after adding 166 apples is x + 166.
We know that the total number of apples in the basket after adding 166 apples is 168. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 166 = 168

Subtracting 166 from both sides gives us:

x = 2

So, there were 2 apples in the basket before the person added 166 apples.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The dragon currently has 380 gold coins. He previously had 333 gold coins. To find out how many gold coins he just added, we subtract the number of gold coins he previously had from the number of gold coins he currently has.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The drummer plays 9234 beats per day. They play each drum solo 171 times a day. To find the number of beats played during each solo, we can divide the total number of beats played per day by the number of solos played per day.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of tigers in the zoo before the new ones arrived is x. After adding 55 new tigers, the total number of tigers becomes x + 55 = 373. To find the number of tigers before the new ones arrived, we can subtract 55 from both sides of the equation: x + 55 - 55 = 373 - 55. This simplifies to x = 318.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the cloudiness index of city B is x. Since the cloudiness index of city A is 1 point more than city B, the cloudiness index of city A is x + 1. We are given that the cloudiness index of city A is 157, so we can set up the equation:

x + 1 = 157

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:

x = 156

So, the cloudiness index of city B is 156.

        A UFO was captured flying at a consistent speed. It was calculated that it traveled 3660 kilometers in 60 minutes. What was the speed of the UFO in kilometers per minute?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the speed of the UFO, we need to divide the distance traveled (3660 km) by the time taken (60 minutes).

First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

60 minutes = 1 hour

Now, we can divide the distance by the time:

3660 km ÷ 1 hour = 3660 km/h

Since we want to find the speed in kilometers per minute, we need to convert the speed from kilometers per hour to kilometers per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

3660 km/h ÷ 60 = 61 km/min

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total energy radiated by the star is 401 units per hour. This includes 82 background units. To find the energy radiated by the star itself, we need to subtract the background units from the total energy.

        There are 5536 bars in total to construct a large jungle gym. If each section of the jungle gym requires 16 bars, how many sections can be constructed?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of sections, we need to divide the total number of bars (5536) by the number of bars required for each section (16).

5536 ÷ 16 = 346.25

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the farmer initially had x apples. After adding 219 apples, the total count became 348. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 219 = 348

To solve for x, we can subtract 219 from both sides of the equation:

x = 348 - 219

x = 129

So, the farmer initially had 129 apples.

        If the total amount of money in your bank account is $425, and $298 of it is still available after paying bills, how much did you spend on bills?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's start by identifying the amount of money available after paying bills, which is $298. This is the total amount of money minus the amount spent on bills.

Let x be the amount spent on bills. Then, the total amount of money minus the amount spent on bills is:

425 - x = 298

To find the amount spent on bills, we can subtract 298 from both sides of the equation:

x = 425 - 298
x = 127

So, you spent $127 on bills.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The bubble blower machine blows 440 bubbles in one minute. Since the first half minute is 30 seconds, it blows 325 bubbles in that time. To find the number of bubbles it blows in the second half minute, we subtract the number of bubbles it blows in the first half minute from the total number of bubbles it blows in one minute:

440 - 325 = 115

So, the bubble blower machine blows 115 bubbles in the second half minute.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of new balloons inflated is x. The total number of balloons is the sum of the initial number of balloons and the new balloons. We can set up the equation:

179 + x = 434

To find the value of x, we can subtract 179 from both sides of the equation:

x = 434 - 179

x = 255

So, the seller inflated 255 new balloons.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the amount of yellow paint is x liters.

Since 8 liters of blue paint were added to make 280 liters of green paint, the total amount of yellow paint is x + 8 liters.

We know that the total amount of green paint is 280 liters, so we can set up the equation:

x + 8 = 280

Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us:

x = 272

So, the amount of yellow paint used is 272 liters.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say Princess Serena had x gold charms initially. Then, she gained 310 silver charms, and her total number of charms became 644. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 310 = 644

Subtracting 310 from both sides gives us:

x = 334

So, Princess Serena already had 334 gold charms in her collection.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

We know that the total cost of the watch is $422, and the manufacturing cost is $200. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

200 + x = 422

To find the value of x, we can subtract 200 from both sides of the equation:

x = 422 - 200
x = 222

So, the brand value, sales profits, and other overheads are $222.
