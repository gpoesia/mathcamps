    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is 1848. Then, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1848:

48/56 = 144/1848
95/23 = 665/1848

Now, we can add the fractions:

144/1848 + 665/1848 = 809/1848

To subtract 34/26 from the result, we need to find the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 1848. Then, we can convert the fraction to have a denominator of 1848:

34/26 = 204/1848

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

809/1848 - 204/1848 = 605/1848

        First, add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65. Then subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result. What is the result expressed as a simple fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 65 is 585. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

88/9 = 88 × 65/585 = 5720/585
28/65 = 28 × 9/585 = 252/585

Now, we can add the fractions:

5720/585 + 252/585 = 5972/585

To subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result, we need to find a common denominator. The LCM of 585 and 37 is 2155. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

5972/585 = 5972 × 37/2155 = 221144/2155
18/37 = 18 × 58/2155 = 1054/2155

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

221144/2155 - 1054/2155 = 220090/2155

        What is the result of (63 / 41) + (44 / 50) when simplified to the lowest terms?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To simplify the expression, we need to divide both the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

For the first fraction, 63 / 41, the GCD of 63 and 41 is 1, so the fraction remains the same.

For the second fraction, 44 / 50, the GCD of 44 and 50 is 2, so we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

44 ÷ 2 = 22
50 ÷ 2 = 25

So, the simplified fraction is 22 / 25.

Now, we can add the two fractions:

(63 / 41) + (22 / 25) = ?

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 2055 (the least common multiple of 41 and 25). So, we can convert both fractions to have this denominator:

(63 / 41) = (63 × 50) / (41 × 50) = 3150 / 2055
(22 / 25) = (22 × 82) / (25 × 82) = 1814 / 2055

Now, we can add the fractions:

3150 / 2055 + 1814 / 2055 = 4964 / 2055

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 2:

4964 ÷ 2 = 2482
2055 ÷ 2 = 1027

So, the simplified result is:

2482 / 1027

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John had 71/41 of a cake left, and Emily added 41/77 of another cake to it. To find the total amount of cake, we need to add these two fractions.

First, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 41 and 77 is 3087. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 3087:

71/41 = 1731/3087
41/77 = 529/3087

Now, we can add these two fractions:

1731/3087 + 529/3087 = 2260/3087

So, there is 2260/3087 of a cake in total.

2. Divide 38 by 53: 38/53 = 38/53
3. Subtract 38/53 from 88: 88 - 38/53 = ?

To subtract a fraction from a whole number, we need to convert the whole number to an equivalent fraction with the same denominator. In this case, the least common multiple (LCM) of 1 and 53 is 53. So, we can convert 88 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 53:

88 = 88/1 = 88/1 × 53/53 = 4736/53

Now we can subtract:

4736/53 - 38/53 = ?

To subtract fractions, we need to have the same denominator. In this case, both fractions already have a denominator of 53, so we can subtract the numerators:

4736 - 38 = 4698

So, the result is:

4698/53

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 53:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To simplify the fractions, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator of each fraction.

For 37/18, the GCD of 37 and 18 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

For 24/60, the GCD of 24 and 60 is 12, so we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 12:

24 ÷ 12 = 2
60 ÷ 12 = 5

So, the simplified fraction is 2/5.

Now, we can add the two simplified fractions:

37/18 + 2/5 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 90. So, we can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 90:

37/18 = 165/180 (multiply numerator and denominator by 10)
2/5 = 36/90 (multiply numerator and denominator by 18)

Now we can add:

165/180 + 36/90 = 201/180

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their GCD, which is 3:

201 ÷ 3 = 67
180 ÷ 3 = 60

So, the simplified sum is 67/60.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add these fractions, we need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 41 and 62 is 2482. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 2482:

33/41 = (33 × 60) / (41 × 60) = 1980/2460
95/62 = (95 × 40) / (62 × 40) = 3800/2480

Now we can add the numerators:

1980 + 3800 = 5780

And keep the same denominator:

5780/2482

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

5780 ÷ 2 = 2890
2482 ÷ 2 = 1241

So, the simplified fraction is:

        Solve ((30 / 11) + (72 / 38)) and then add the result to (81 / 34). Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to simplify the expressions inside the parentheses:

(30 / 11) = 30/11 = 15/11
(72 / 38) = 72/38 = 6/19

Now, we can evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

((30 / 11) + (72 / 38)) = (15/11) + (6/19)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 209. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

(15/11) = (15 × 19)/(11 × 19) = 285/209
(6/19) = (6 × 11)/(19 × 11) = 66/209

Now, we can add the fractions:

(285/209) + (66/209) = 351/209

Finally, we need to add the result to (81 / 34):

(351/209) + (81/34) = (351 × 34)/(209 × 34) + (81 × 209)/(34 × 209)
= 11934/7136 + 16869/7136
= 28803/7136

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

28803/7136 = 25/6

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to simplify the fractions inside the parentheses:

(64 / 34) = 64/34 = 16/8.5 = 16/17 (since 8.5 = 17/2)

(3 / 24) = 3/24 = 1/8

Now, we can add the simplified fractions:

(16/17) + (1/8) = (128+17)/136 = 145/136

Next, we add the result to (41 / 96):

(145/136) + (41/96) = (13872+3916)/12976 = 18788/12976

We can simplify the fraction further by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

18788/12976 = 4722/3239

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions 83/73 and 53/77, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is 777. Then, we can convert both fractions to have the LCM as the denominator:

83/73 = 83 × (777/777) / (73 × (777/777)) = 1131/777
53/77 = 53 × (777/777) / (77 × (777/777)) = 651/777

Now, we can add the fractions:

1131/777 + 651/777 = 1782/777

So, the result 'w' is 1782/777.

To add 80/76 to 'w', we need to find the LCM of the denominators, which is 777. Then, we can convert the fraction 80/76 to have the LCM as the denominator:

80/76 = 80 × (777/777) / (76 × (777/777)) = 1083/777

Now, we can add the fractions:

1782/777 + 1083/777 = 2865/777

To simplify the fraction 2865/777, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

To subtract fractions, we need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 47 is 329. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 2940. Then, we can add the numerators:

(82 × 60) + (45 × 49) = 4920 + 2205 = 7125

So, d = 7125/2940

2. Add d to the third fraction:

7125/2940 + 99/59 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 17540. Then, we can add the numerators:

(7125 × 59) + (99 × 2940) = 420525 + 291840 = 712365

So, the resulting sum is:

712365/17540

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

(8/91) + 176.6 - (32/76) = (8/91) + 176.6 - (8*4)/(19*4) = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 = (8/91) + 176.6 - 8/19 =</pre>

Now, add these two values:

((75 / 45) + (5 / 49)) = (5/3) + (1/49) = 58/147 + 1/49 = 58/147 + 3/147 = 61/147

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 35 and 85 is 595. So, we can rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 595:

86/35 = 258/595
68/85 = 204/595

Now we can add the two fractions:

258/595 + 204/595 = 462/595

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 46:

56/33 = (56 × 3) / (33 × 3) = 168/99

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

222/81 - 168/99 = (222 - 168)/81 = 54/81

To simplify the fraction further, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, which is 27:

Now, we can add the fractions:
237/100 + 22/110 = 237/100 + 209/1100 = 446/1100
Now, we subtract 91/65 from the sum:

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 99. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum, we need to add the two fractions:

32/65 + 73/22

We can do this by finding a common denominator, which is 110. Then, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 110:

32/65 = 64/110
73/22 = 73/22 (no change needed)

Now, we can add the fractions:

64/110 + 73/22

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 110. Then, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 110:

64/110 = 64/110
73/22 = 91/110

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the difference between 51/34 and 12/86, we need to subtract the two fractions.

First, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 34 and 86 is 578. So, we can rewrite both fractions with a denominator of 578:

51/34 = 147/578
12/86 = 78/578

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:

147/578 - 78/578 = 69/578

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 69. This gives us:

69/578 = 1/8

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's add the whole number 51 to the fraction 93/8:

51 + 93/8 = 51 + 11.625 = 62.625

Now, let's add the result to the fraction 58/44:

62.625 + 58/44 = 62.625 + 0.636363... (repeating decimal)

To add a decimal to a fraction, we can convert the decimal to a fraction with the same denominator. In this case, the denominator is 44. So, we can write:

0.636363... = 58/44

Now, we can add the two fractions:

62.625 + 58/44 = 62.625 + 58/44 = 63.625/1

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. Therefore, the simplified fraction is:

6056/702 - 46/41 = (6056*41 - 702*46) / (702*41)
= (248936 - 25572) / 28882
= 253364 / 28882

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

253364 ÷ 2 = 126682
28882 ÷ 2 = 14441

So, the simplified fraction is:

126682/14441

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Twice the value of 29/23 means we need to multiply 29/23 by 2. We can do this by multiplying the numerator (29) by 2 and keeping the denominator (23) the same, which gives us 58/23.

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. Therefore, the simplest form of the answer is 58/23.

        After calculating the value of 2*(29/23), subtract this result from 32/5. What is the resulting fraction in simplest form?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we calculate the value of 2*(29/23) as we did earlier: 2*(29/23) = 58/23.

Next, we subtract this result from 32/5:

(32/5) - (58/23) = ?

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 115. So, we convert both fractions to have this denominator:

(32/5) = (32*23)/115 = 736/115
(58/23) = (58*5)/115 = 290/115

Now we can subtract:

(736/115) - (290/115) = 446/115

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 23. Therefore, the simplest form of the answer is:

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 72 is 360. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 360:

29/20 = 261/360
17/72 = 85/360

Now we can add them:

261/360 + 85/360 = 346/360

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum, we need to add the two fractions:

73/39 + 49/14 = ?

First, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 39 and 14 is 273. So, we can rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 273:

73/39 = 73 × 7 / 39 × 7 = 511/273
49/14 = 49 × 19 / 14 × 19 = 931/273

Now we can add the fractions:

511/273 + 931/273 = 1442/273

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

1442 ÷ 2 = 721
273 ÷ 2 = 136.5

So, the simplified fraction is:

721/136.5

To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 1 and 92 is 92. So, we can rewrite 79/1 as 7539/92.
Now, we can subtract:
7539/92 - 30/92 = 7509/92
Next, we need to subtract 61/63 from the result. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 92 and 63 is 2796. So, we can rewrite 61/63 as 382/2796.

2. Simplify the expression:

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract 92/84 from 31/5, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 84 is 420. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

31/5 = 372/420
92/84 = 92/84 (no change needed)

Now, we can subtract:

372/420 - 92/84 = 372/420 - 92/84

To subtract fractions, we subtract the numerators (the numbers on top) and keep the same denominator:

372 - 92 = 280
420

So, the result is:

280/420

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 20:

280 ÷ 20 = 14
420 ÷ 20 = 21

So, the simplified result is:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the results of the divisions:
95/83 = 0.115 (approximately)
52/21 = 2.47619 (approximately)
75/67 = 1.1194 (approximately)
Adding these results together, we get:
0.115 + 2.47619 + 1.1194 = 3.71069 (approximately)

Now, we need to simplify this decimal result to a fraction:
3.71069 ≈ 371/100

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate the expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 73 by 27: 73 / 27 = 2 19/27
2. Divide 23 by 48: 23 / 48 = 1/2
3. Subtract the two results: 2 19/27 - 1/2

To subtract a fraction from a mixed number, we need to convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:

2 19/27 = (2 × 27) + 19/27 = 56 + 19/27 = 75/27

Now we can subtract:

75/27 - 1/2 = (75 - 54)/27 = 21/27

(70 / 23) = 3.04347826087 (approximately)

Now, we can simplify the expression:

39 - 3.04347826087 ≈ 35.956521739

Since the decimal part is not a terminating decimal, we can leave it as an approximate decimal value.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add 34/1 and 53/4, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1 and 4 is 4. So, we can rewrite 34/1 as 34/1 * 4/4 = 136/4.

Now we can add:

136/4 + 53/4 = 189/4

To express this as a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

189 ÷ 4 = 47 with a remainder of 1

To add 24/67 to this result, we can add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:

47 1/4 + 24/67 = ?

First, we can convert 47 1/4 to an improper fraction:

47 1/4 = 189/4

Now we can add:

189/4 + 24/67 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 67 is 268. So, we can rewrite 189/4 as:

189/4 * 67/67 = 12687/268

Now we can add:

12687/268 + 24/67 = 12711/268

To express this as a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

12711 ÷ 268 = 47 with a remainder of 23

To add 34/97 and 53/4, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 97 and 4 is 388. So, we can rewrite 34/97 as 34/97 * 4/4 = 136/388 and 53/4 as 53/4 * 97/97 = 5093/388.

Now we can add:

136/388 + 5093/388 = 5229/388

To express this as a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

5229 ÷ 388 = 13 with a remainder of 57

97/96 = 247/288

Now we can add the fractions:

d = 88/72 + 69/47

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 376. So, we can rewrite the equation as:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum, we need to add the two fractions:

16/7 + 11/90

First, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 90 is 630. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 630:

16/7 = 96/210 (multiply numerator and denominator by 90)
11/90 = 77/630 (multiply numerator and denominator by 7)

Now we can add the fractions:

96/210 + 77/630 = (96 + 77)/630 = 173/630

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 173. This gives us:

1/3
