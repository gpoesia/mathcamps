        There are 535 fish in a large tank and a shark eats 461 of them in one sitting. If the shark continues this pattern and only eats when there are 461 or more fish to consume, how many fish will be leftover after its dinner?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The shark eats 461 fish at a time. To find the number of times the shark can eat, we divide the total number of fish by 461: 535/461 = 1 with a remainder of 74.
This means the shark can eat 461 fish once, leaving 74 fish behind.

        A baker baked a total of 928 cookies. He decided to distribute equal amounts of cookies to 186 orphanages. After giving out as many entire sets of cookies as possible to each orphanage, how many cookies does the baker have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The baker has 928 cookies and wants to distribute them equally among 186 orphanages. To find out how many cookies each orphanage will get, we can divide 928 by 186.

928 ÷ 186 = 5 with a remainder of 0

This means each orphanage will get 5 cookies, and there will be no remainder. The baker will give out as many entire sets of cookies as possible, which is 5 cookies per orphanage.

To find out how many cookies the baker has left, we can subtract the total number of cookies given out from the original amount:

928 - (186 x 5) = 928 - 930 = -2

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, this means the baker has 0 cookies left. He gave out all the cookies.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of full pizza boxes, we can divide the total number of slices (975) by the number of slices each box can hold (196).
975 ÷ 196 = 5 (with a remainder of 5)

        A wizard casts a spell to summon 932 magical stones. Each powerful creature he summons requires 193 stones. After summoning several creatures, how many stones will the wizard have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's divide the total number of stones (932) by the number of stones required per creature (193) to find out how many creatures the wizard can summon:

932 ÷ 193 = 4 with a remainder of 8

This means the wizard can summon 4 creatures, and will have 8 stones left over.

The wizard will need 193 stones for each of the 4 creatures, which is a total of:

4 x 193 = 772 stones

Subtracting the number of stones used from the total, we get:

932 - 772 = 160

The wizard will have 160 stones left.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's recalculate the number of stones needed for each creature based on the new requirement:

932 ÷ 544 = 1 with a remainder of 288

This means the wizard can summon only 1 creature, and will have 288 stones left over.

The wizard will need 544 stones for the 1 creature, which is the only creature he can summon.

Subtracting the number of stones used from the total, we get:

932 - 544 = 388

The wizard will have 388 stones left.

        A builder has a job to install 660 square foot tiles in a house. Each tile can cover 335 square feet. After installing tiles evenly across the available space, how many square feet will the last tile need to cover?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total area to be covered is 660 square feet. Each tile covers 335 square feet. To find the number of tiles needed, we can divide the total area by the area each tile covers:

660 ÷ 335 = 2 (with a remainder of 0)

This means the builder can install 2 full tiles. To find the area left uncovered, we can multiply the number of full tiles by the area each tile covers:

2 x 335 = 670

Since the total area is 660, the area left uncovered is:

670 - 660 = 10

The last tile will need to cover the remaining 10 square feet.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of containers that can be filled, we divide the total amount of juice (473 gallons) by the capacity of each container (22 gallons).
473 ÷ 22 = 21.5 (round down to 21, since we can't fill a fraction of a container)
This means we can fill 21 containers.

        A wildlife reserve has 740 tigers. The reserve is divided into different zones, and each zone can only hold up to 696 tigers. If tigers are distributed evenly among the zones, how many tigers will be left in the last zone?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since each zone can hold up to 696 tigers, the number of tigers that can be distributed evenly among the zones is 696. To find the number of zones, we can divide the total number of tigers (740) by the number of tigers that can be distributed evenly (696).

740 ÷ 696 = 1.06 (round down to 1, since you can't have a fraction of a zone)

So, there will be 1 zone with 696 tigers, and the remaining tigers will be in the last zone.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since each zone can now hold up to 908 tigers, the number of tigers that can be distributed evenly among the zones is 908. To find the number of zones, we can divide the total number of tigers (740) by the number of tigers that can be distributed evenly (908).

740 ÷ 908 = 0.81 (round down to 0, since you can't have a fraction of a zone)

So, there will be 0 zones with 908 tigers, and the remaining tigers will be in the first zone.

908 - 740 = 168

The first zone will have 168 tigers, and the remaining tigers will be distributed among the subsequent zones.

To find the number of tigers left in the last zone, we can subtract the total number of tigers distributed evenly (740) from the total number of tigers (740).

740 - 740 = 0

There will be no tigers left in the last zone, since all tigers have been distributed evenly among the zones.

        Considering the previous scenario with the constellation, suppose there were only 278 stars in the constellation instead of 544, and they were still to be grouped into smaller clusters of 446 stars each. If the clusters are evenly distributed, how many stars will now remain ungrouped?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of clusters, we divide the total number of stars (278) by the number of stars in each cluster (446). This gives us 278/446 = 0.62, which means we can make 0 whole clusters and a remainder of 0.62 clusters.
Since we can't have a fraction of a cluster, we'll round down to 0 clusters. This means we'll have 0 clusters with 0 stars and 278 stars left over.

This means the postman will need 0 mailboxes for 616 letters (since 0 mailboxes can hold 0 letters), and another mailbox for the remaining letters.
The remaining letters can be found by subtracting the number of letters in the first mailbox (0) from the total number of letters (524):

    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of jumps the frog makes is x. Then, the number of flies eaten by the frog is 258x. Since the total number of flies is 941, the number of flies left is 941 - 258x.

We can set up an equation: 941 - 258x = 0

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by -258: x = -941/258

Since the number of jumps cannot be negative, we can ignore the negative solution. Therefore, the frog makes 0 jumps.

The number of flies left is: 941 - 258(0) = 941

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the amount of water that can be distributed evenly, we can divide the total amount of water (193 liters) by the number of bottles (167).

Since each bottle can hold 1.16 liters, and we want to distribute the water evenly, we can multiply the number of bottles by the amount each bottle can hold:
167 x 1.16 = 194.12 liters

Since we started with 193 liters, we can see that there is a small amount of water left over that cannot be distributed evenly:

533 ÷ 886 = 0.6 (round down to 0, since you can't have a fraction of a tent)
So, we need 0 tents for 886 campers, and then we'll have some campers left over.
Since we can't have a negative number of tents, we'll need to recalculate:
533 ÷ 886 = 0.6 (round up to 1, since you can't have a fraction of a tent)

886 campers will be accommodated in the first tent, leaving:

        In continuation of the previous scenario with seashells, imagine instead that there were initially only 234 seashells collected from the beach, but the souvenir sets are still made up of 474 shells each. How many shells would be left after attempting to form these sets?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since there are only 234 seashells, we can't form a full set of 474 shells. Let's see how many sets we can form:
234 ÷ 474 = 0 (with a remainder of 234)
This means that we can't form any full sets, and the remaining shells are the same as the initial number of shells (234).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The teacher has 928 pages to print. The printer can print 336 pages at a time. To find out how many times the teacher needs to fill the printer, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages the printer can print at a time: 928 ÷ 336 = 2 with a remainder of 272.
This means the teacher needs to fill the printer 2 times, and then he will have 272 pages left over.

        A furniture factory has manufactured 380 chairs to distribute to its retail shops. Each shop can only hold 310 chairs in its storage. If the factory evenly distributes all the chairs to the shops, how many chairs will be left at the factory?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The factory has 380 chairs to distribute. Each shop can hold 310 chairs. To find out how many chairs each shop will get, we divide the total number of chairs by the number of shops. Since we don't know the number of shops, let's call it x. Then, we can set up the equation:

380 = 310x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 310:

x = 380 / 310
x = 1.23 (round down to 1, since you can't have a fraction of a shop)

So, there is only 1 shop. Now, we can find out how many chairs each shop will get:

310 chairs per shop

The factory will distribute 310 chairs to 1 shop. To find out how many chairs are left at the factory, we subtract the number of chairs distributed from the total number of chairs:

380 - 310 = 70

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The factory has 70 chairs left after distributing to the retail shops. Each distributor can hold 143 chairs. To find out how many chairs each distributor will get, we divide the total number of chairs left by the number of distributors. Since we don't know the number of distributors, let's call it x. Then, we can set up the equation:

70 = 143x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 143:

x = 70 / 143
x = 0.49 (round down to 0, since you can't have a fraction of a distributor)

So, there are 0 distributors. This doesn't make sense, since the factory can't distribute chairs to 0 distributors. However, we can still find out how many chairs each distributor would get if there were distributors:

143 chairs per distributor

The factory would distribute 143 chairs to each distributor. To find out how many chairs are left at the factory, we subtract the number of chairs distributed from the total number of chairs:

70 - 0 = 70

Since there are no distributors, the factory will still have 70 chairs left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The windmill generates 506 units of power per day. The village consumes 920 units of power. To find the amount of power left over, we need to subtract the consumption from the generation:

506 - 920 = -414

However, since the consumption is in complete units, we can't have a negative amount of power left over. Instead, we need to find the remainder when the consumption is divided by the generation:

920 ÷ 506 = 1.82 (round down to 1, since you can't consume a fraction of an increment)

This means the village consumes 506 units of power in full increments, leaving:

        There are 846 water droplets in a cloud. Each raindrop needs 722 droplets to form. If all droplets are used to form raindrops, how many droplets would be left unconverted in the cloud after reaching the maximum number of rain drops?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The maximum number of raindrops that can be formed is 846 / 722 = 1.17 (since you can't have a fraction of a raindrop). Since you can't form a fraction of a raindrop, the maximum number of raindrops that can be formed is 846 // 722 = 1 (integer division).
The remaining droplets after forming 1 raindrop is 846 - 722 = 124.

        There was a slight miscalculation in the cloud's droplet count. There are actually 846 water droplets in the cloud, but each raindrop needs 442 droplets to form instead of 722. With this updated droplet count per raindrop, how many droplets would be left unconverted in the cloud after reaching the maximum number of rain drops?

        Unicorn Village, a magical place where 265 unicorns live, is divided into 146 equal sections where these magical creatures reside. If each section is occupied by an equal number of unicorns, how many unicorns will live in the last incomplete section?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of unicorns in each section, we can divide the total number of unicorns (265) by the number of sections (146). This gives us 265/146 = 1.82 (approximately).
Since the sections are equal, the number of unicorns in each section is 1.82. However, we can't have a fraction of a unicorn, so we'll round down to 1 unicorn per section.
The last section will have 1 less unicorn than the other sections, since it's incomplete. Therefore, the last section will have 1 - 1.82 = -0.82 unicorns (which is not possible, since you can't have a negative number of unicorns).
To find the actual number of unicorns in the last section, we can subtract the total number of unicorns (265) by the total number of unicorns in the complete sections (146 x 1.82 = 265.72). This gives us 265 - 265.72 = -0.72 unicorns (which is not possible, since you can't have a negative number of unicorns).
Since we can't have a negative number of unicorns, we'll assume that the last section is actually complete, and it has 1 unicorn, just like the other sections. This means that the total number of unicorns is 146 x 1.82 = 265.72, which is not possible since we can't have a fraction of a unicorn.
To find the actual number of unicorns in the last section, we can subtract the total number of unicorns (265) by the total number of unicorns in the complete sections (146 x 1 = 146). This gives us 265 - 146 = 119 unicorns.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The number of boxes that can be loaded onto the trucks is equal to the number of trucks multiplied by the capacity of each truck. Since each truck can hold up to 371 boxes, the total number of boxes that can be loaded is 371 * (number of trucks).

Let's calculate the number of trucks needed to load all the boxes:

Number of trucks = Total number of boxes / Capacity of each truck
= 514 / 371
= 1.39 (round down to 1, since you can't have a fraction of a truck)

So, 1 truck can be loaded with 371 boxes, leaving:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The number of sandcastles that formed complete sets is equal to the number of sets multiplied by the number of sandcastles in each set. Since there are 684 sandcastles and each set has 230 sandcastles, the number of complete sets is 684/230 = 3 (with a remainder of 0).

This means that 3 complete sets were formed, leaving 684 - (3 x 230) = 684 - 690 = 6 sandcastles that didn't form a complete set.

Since Jon can't make a full puzzle with 259 pieces, he will have 259 pieces left over.

        A police station received 927 calls within a week. They have 311 operators who can handle the same number of calls each week. However, when the calls are divided equally, how many calls will the last operator handle?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of calls each operator will handle, we need to divide the total number of calls (927) by the number of operators (311).
927 ÷ 311 = 3 with a remainder of 0
This means that each operator will handle 3 calls, except for the last one.
To find the number of calls the last operator will handle, we need to subtract the number of calls each operator will handle (3) from the remainder (0), since the last operator will not handle a full 3 calls.
0 - 3 = -3
Since we can't have a negative number of calls, we can add the total number of calls (927) to the remainder to get the correct answer.
0 + 927 = 927
So, the last operator will handle 927 - (3 x 310) = 927 - 930 = -3 calls.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of pizzas that fit into the boxes, we can divide the total number of pizzas (620) by the number of pizzas each box can hold (578).

620 ÷ 578 = 1.07 (approximately)

Since we can't put a fraction of a pizza in a box, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which means we can fit 578 pizzas into the boxes.

To find the number of pizzas left over, we'll subtract the number of pizzas that fit into the boxes from the total number of pizzas:

620 - 578 = 42

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, let's calculate the number of boxes needed to hold the total number of pizzas (694):

694 ÷ 578 = 1.20 (approximately)

Since we can't put a fraction of a pizza in a box, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which means we can fit 578 pizzas into 1 box and 116 pizzas into the next box.

The remaining pizzas will be:

694 - (578 + 578) = 694 - 1156 = 538

Since we already used 578 pizzas in the first box, we'll subtract 578 from the remaining pizzas:

538 - 578 = -40

This means we have 40 pizzas more than the number of pizzas that can fit into the boxes. Since we can't put a negative number of pizzas in a box, we'll ignore the negative result and focus on the remaining pizzas.

        A t-shirt company has a batch of 258 shirts in production. Each box can pack 67 shirts. If all the shirts are evenly distributed in the boxes, how many shirts would be left outside the boxes?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of boxes needed, we can divide the total number of shirts (258) by the number of shirts that can fit in each box (67).

258 ÷ 67 = 3 with a remainder of 57

        Suppose the t-shirt company actually had a batch of 258 shirts, but this time each box can pack 828 shirts. If all the shirts are evenly distributed in the boxes, how many shirts would be left outside the boxes?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of boxes needed, we can divide the total number of shirts (258) by the number of shirts that can fit in each box (828).

258 ÷ 828 = 0 with a remainder of 258

This means that the number of shirts (258) is less than the capacity of each box (828), so the shirts can be evenly distributed in a single box. There would be no shirts left outside the box.

        There are 776 snails all lined up in a row. If you group them in bunches of 375 snails, how many snails will be left in the final group?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of groups, we can divide the total number of snails (776) by the number of snails in each group (375).

776 ÷ 375 = 2 (with a remainder)

This means that we can make 2 groups of 375 snails each, and there will be a remainder of snails left over.

To find the number of snails left over, we can multiply the number of groups (2) by the number of snails in each group (375), and then subtract the total number of snails from the result.

2 x 375 = 750
750 - 776 = -26

However, since we can't have a negative number of snails, this means that there will be 26 snails left over in the final group.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's recalculate the number of groups and the remainder:

776 ÷ 18 = 43 (with a remainder)

This means that we can make 43 groups of 18 snails each, and there will be a remainder of snails left over.

To find the number of snails left over, we can multiply the number of groups (43) by the number of snails in each group (18), and then subtract the total number of snails from the result.

43 x 18 = 774
774 - 776 = 2

So, if each bunch had 18 snails instead, there would be 2 snails left in the final group.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The factory produces 589 pillows per day. Each box holds 198 pillows, so the number of full boxes that can be packed is 589/198 = 3 (since 3 x 198 = 594, which is less than 589).
The number of pillows left outside the boxes is the remaining pillows after packing 3 full boxes, which is 589 - 594 = -5 (since 594 is more than 589, there are actually 5 pillows left over, not 5 less).
Since you can't have a negative number of pillows, the factory will have 589 - 594 = 5 pillows left outside the boxes at the end of the day.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find out how many children went down the slide in the second wave. Since 771 children went down the slide initially, and now there are 923 children waiting, the number of children who arrived in the second wave is:
923 - 771 = &lt;&lt;923-771=152&gt;&gt;152 children arrived in the second wave.

Now, 881 children can go down the slide without any break this time. Since 771 children went down the slide initially, the number of children who went down the slide in the second wave is:
881 - 771 = &lt;&lt;881-771=110&gt;&gt;110 children went down the slide in the second wave.

The total number of children who went down the slide is the sum of the initial 771 children and the 110 children who went down the slide in the second wave:
771 + 110 = &lt;&lt;771+110=881&gt;&gt;881 children went down the slide.

The number of children left waiting for their turn is the total number of children minus the number of children who went down the slide:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The penguin scientist can tag 309 penguins in groups of 293. To find the number of groups, we can divide 309 by 293.
309 ÷ 293 = 1 with a remainder of 16
This means that 1 group of 293 penguins can be tagged, and there will be 16 penguins left over.

        A sandwich shop has 580 slices of bread. They use 18 slices of bread for each sandwich-making batch. After using up the bread in these batches, how many slices will they have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The sandwich shop has 580 slices of bread initially.
They use 18 slices of bread for each sandwich-making batch.
To find the number of batches, we divide the total slices by the slices used per batch: 580 ÷ 18 = 32.22 (round down to 32, since you can't make a fraction of a batch).
So, they make 32 batches, using up 32 × 18 = 576 slices of bread.
The remaining slices of bread are: 580 - 576 = 4.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The tailor has 925 meters of fabric initially.
The tailor uses 529 meters of fabric for each dress.
To find the number of dresses the tailor can make, we divide the total fabric by the amount used per dress: 925 ÷ 529 = 1.75 (round down to 1, since you can't make a fraction of a dress).
The tailor can make 1 dress with 529 meters of fabric, leaving 925 - 529 = 396 meters of fabric unused.
