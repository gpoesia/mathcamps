        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Steve started with 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days, so he spent 38/8 = 4.75 dollars each day. Since he received an extra 11 dollars, he now has 38 - 8*4.75 + 11 = 38 - 38 + 11 = 11 dollars.
John started with 18 dollars and spent the same amount of money as Steve had, which is 11 dollars. So John now has 18 - 11 = 7 dollars. John found 25 dollars on the street, so he now has 7 + 25 = 32 dollars.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Sally initially traveled 47/50 = 0.94 miles. Then, she traveled 31 miles. So, she traveled a total of 0.94 + 31 = 31.94 miles.
For the next 28 days, she traveled the same distance every day, which is 31.94 miles. So, she traveled 31.94 * 28 = 893.52 miles.
On the day she took a detour, she added an extra 32/24 = 1.33 miles to her regular bike route. So, she traveled 31.94 + 1.33 = 33.27 miles that day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, Amy's garden is 11 feet long.
After expanding it by 30 more feet, the length becomes 11 + 30 = 41 feet.
Then, she decides to further extend the garden by the length equivalent to 30 divided by 13 feet, which is 30/13 = 2.3077... (approximately 2.3 feet).
So, the total length of her garden after all the expansions is 41 + 2.3 = 43.3 feet.

The distance from John's house to his work is (17/3) miles. So, the distance from the supermarket to John's work is:

Simplifying the fraction, we get 25/40 + 5/88 = 25/40 + 5/88 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176 = 25/40 + 1/176</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, the scientist mixes 10/42 liters of solution A and 32 liters of solution B. The total amount of solution is 10/42 + 32 = 10/42 * 42/42 + 32 * 42/42 = 10 + 32 * 42/42 = 10 + 32 * 1 = 10 + 32 = 42 liters.
After removing 4/28 liters, the remaining amount of solution is 42 - 4/28 * 42 = 42 - 4/28 * 14 = 42 - 4/2 = 42 - 2 = 40 liters.
Then, the scientist extracts 11/29 of the remaining 40 liters. The amount of solution used for the experiment is 11/29 * 40 = 11/29 * 29/29 * 40/29 = 11 * 40/29 = 440/29 = 15 15/29 liters.

            There are two containers of juice. The first one contains 23/35 gallon. The second one contains 50/41 gallon. 

After mixing the two containers of juice together, it was transferred into a bottle which can hold 28 gallons. 

How much space is left in the bottle after subtracting 11/19 gallon which was drunk by a customer?

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the total amount of juice in both containers. We can do this by adding the fractions:

(23/35) + (50/41) = (23 Ã— 41) / (35 Ã— 41) + (50 Ã— 35) / (41 Ã— 35) = 943/1475 + 1750/1475 = 2693/1475

So, the total amount of juice is 2693/1475 gallons.

Since the bottle can hold 28 gallons, we can subtract the total amount of juice from the capacity of the bottle to find the space left:

28 - 2693/1475 = 28 Ã— (1475/1475) - 2693/1475 = 28 - 2693/1475 = 28 - 1.83 = 26.17

Now, 11/19 gallon was drunk by a customer. We can subtract this from the space left:

26.17 - 11/19 = 26.17 - 0.58 = 25.59

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The cost of a regular cake is $47. The additional fee for a custom design is $6 divided by the 26 available designs. To find the additional fee, we can divide $6 by 26: $6/26 = $0.23. This means the additional fee is $0.23 per design. Since there are 26 designs, the total additional fee would be $0.23 x 26 = $6. Adding this to the cost of the regular cake, the total cost would be $47 + $6 = $53.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days. To find the rate of apple consumption, we need to find the number of pounds of apples consumed per day. We can do this by dividing the total pounds of apples consumed (17) by the number of days (8):

17 pounds / 8 days = 2.125 pounds per day

John consumes apple juice at a rate of 48 ounces every 42 days. To find the rate of apple juice consumption per day, we can divide the total ounces consumed (48) by the number of days (42):

48 ounces / 42 days = 1.143 ounces per day

Now, we need to convert the rate of apple juice consumption from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in 1 pound, so:

1.143 ounces per day / 16 ounces per pound = 0.07125 pounds per day

To find the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption, we can divide the rate of apple consumption (2.125 pounds per day) by the rate of apple juice consumption (0.07125 pounds per day):

2.125 pounds per day / 0.07125 pounds per day = 29.83

            In the previous journey, John decided to increase his daily walking distance. He walked for 14 miles instead of 10 each day for seven weeks. After the seven weeks, he still needed to walk an additional 21 miles to reach his destination. How many miles did he have to walk this time to reach his destination?

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John walked 14 miles every day for 7 weeks, which is 14 x 7 = 98 miles per week.
Since he walked for 7 weeks, he walked a total of 98 x 7 = 686 miles.
He still needed to walk an additional 21 miles to reach his destination.
So, he had to walk a total of 686 + 21 = 707 miles.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the toy, including tax. The cost of the toy is 18 dollars, and the tax is 41/14 dollars. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the toy and the tax: 18 + 41/14 = 18 + 2.929 (approximately) = 20.929.
Susan has 48 dollars initially, and she spends 20.929 dollars on the toy. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost of the toy from the initial amount: 48 - 20.929 = 27.071.

Let's convert 23/21 to a decimal: 23/21 = 1.09 (approximately)
So, Walter has 46 + 1.09 = 47.09 dollars left.
This means Walter had 47.09 + 23/21 dollars originally.
Let's convert 47.09 to a decimal: 47.09 = 47.09
So, Walter had 47.09 + 1.09 = 48.18 dollars originally.

            A journey took 43/17 hours to complete. After the journey, a break of 31/4 hours was taken. What is the total time spent on the journey and the break?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The journey took 43/17 hours to complete. To find the total hours spent on the journey, we need to convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction: 43/17 = 43/17.
The break was 31/4 hours. To find the total hours spent on the journey and the break, we add the hours spent on the journey and the break: 43/17 + 31/4 = 43/17 + 31/4.
To add the fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is 68. Then, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 68: 43/17 = 206/68 and 31/4 = 31*17/4*17 = 527/68.
Now, we can add the fractions: 206/68 + 527/68 = 733/68.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Carrie's car consumes 41 liters of fuel to travel 1 hour. To find out how much fuel it consumes in 49/48 hours, we need to multiply the number of hours by the amount of fuel consumed per hour.

49/48 hours = 1 + 1/48 hours (since 1/48 is the fractional part)
Fuel consumed in 1 hour = 41 liters
Fuel consumed in 1 + 1/48 hours = 41 + 41/48 liters

To find the total fuel consumed, we add the fuel consumed in the whole hour and the fuel consumed in the fractional part:

41 + 41/48 = 41 + 0.86 (approximately) = 41.86 liters

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Oscar has $33 saved up, and he spends 13/41 of his money on a new video game. To find the amount he spends, we can multiply the total amount he has by the fraction of it he spends:

$33 x (13/41) = ?

To multiply a decimal by a fraction, we can multiply the decimal by the numerator and then divide by the denominator:

$33 x (13) = $429
$429 Ã· 41 = $10.51

So, Oscar spends $10.51 on the video game.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 8B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The turtle travels at a speed of 19/6 feet per second. To find the distance traveled in 24 seconds, we multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
= (19/6) x 24
= (19 x 4) / 6
= 76 / 6
= 12.67 feet

Since the turtle starts 20 feet ahead from the starting point, the total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled and the initial distance:

Total Distance = Distance Traveled + Initial Distance
= 12.67 + 20
= 32.67 feet
