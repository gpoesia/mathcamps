            The perimeter of a rectangular swimming pool is 324 meters. The length of the pool is 83 meters. What is the width of the pool?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since the perimeter is 324 meters, we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 324

where l is the length and w is the width.

We are given that the length is 83 meters, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

2(83 + w) = 324

Simplifying the equation, we get:

166 + 2w = 324

Subtracting 166 from both sides gives:

2w = 158

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

w = 79

We know the perimeter is 40m, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 40

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since the perimeter is 194 cm, we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 194

where l is the length of one side (49 cm) and w is the length of the other side.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2(49 + w) = 194

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

98 + 2w = 194

Subtracting 98 from both sides, we get:

2w = 96

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

w = 48

So, the length of the other side is 48 cm.

2(l + w) = 52

where l is the length of the side that is 4 meters, and w is the length of the other side.

Substituting l = 4, we get:

2(4 + w) = 52

Simplifying the equation, we get:

8 + 2w = 52

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

2w = 44

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's denote the length of the fourth side as x. Since the perimeter is the sum of all sides, we can set up the equation:

37 + 98 + 41 + x = 219

176 + x = 219

Subtract 176 from both sides:

x = 43

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since it's a square, all sides are equal. Let's call the length of one side &quot;x&quot;. Then, the perimeter is 4x.

We know the perimeter is 44m, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 44

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 44/4
x = 11

So, the length of one side of the square is 11m.

2x + 142 = 282

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the length of the shorter side be x meters, and the length of the longer side be y meters.

We know that the perimeter of the garden is 128 meters, which is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since it's a rectangle, we can write:

2x + 2y = 128

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + y = 64

We're also given that the shorter side has a length of 57 meters, so we can substitute x = 57 into the equation:

57 + y = 64

Subtracting 57 from both sides gives us:

y = 7

So, the length of the longer side is 7 meters.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides, which is equal to 4 times the length of one side. Since the perimeter is given as 392m, we can set up the equation:

4s = 392

where s is the length of one side.

To solve for s, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

s = 392/4
s = 98

So, the length of each side of the square is 98m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since the perimeter is 204m, we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 204

where l is the length of one side (16m) and w is the length of the other side.

Substituting l = 16, we get:

2(16 + w) = 204

Simplifying the equation, we get:

32 + 2w = 204

Subtracting 32 from both sides, we get:

2w = 172

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

w = 86

So, the length of the other side is 86m.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the information given:

* The perimeter of the quadrilateral is 206m.
* Two sides together have a length of 58m, which means one side is x and the other side is 58 - x.
* The other two sides together have a length of 54m and 1m, respectively, which means one side is y and the other side is 54 - y.
* The total length of the two pairs of sides is 58 - x + x + 54 - y + y = 58 + 54 = 112m.

Now, we can set up an equation to find the missing portion of the perimeter:

206 - (58 + 54) = 94 = missing portion

So, the length of the missing portion of the perimeter is 94m.

4x = 284

To find the length of each side, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 284/4
x = 71

2(l + w) = 150

where l is the length and w is the width.

Given that the length is 69 feet, we can substitute this value into the equation:

2(69 + w) = 150

Simplifying the equation, we get:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since the perimeter is 166m, we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 166

where l is the length and w is the width of the rectangle.

We know that one of the sides measures 35m, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

2(l + 35) = 166

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2l + 70 = 166

Subtracting 70 from both sides gives:

2l = 96

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

l = 48

So, the length of the rectangle is 48m. Since the perimeter is the sum of all sides, the width is the difference between the perimeter and the length:

w = 166 - 2(48) = 166 - 96 = 70

So, the width of the rectangle is 70m.

2(l + x) = 336

where l is the length of the side that is already known (79 feet).

Substituting l = 79, we get:

2(79 + x) = 336

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

158 + 2x = 336

Subtracting 158 from both sides gives:

x = 89

We know that the perimeter of the rectangular field is 200 meters. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

We are given that the length of the field is 49 meters, so we can plug that value into the formula:

200 = 2(49 + Width)

Now, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 1/2:

100 = 49 + Width

Subtract 49 from both sides to get:

51 = Width

So, the width of the field is 51 meters.

            Imagine a rectangle with a perimeter of 96 feet. You know that one pair of opposite sides are each 33 feet long. Can you find the length of the other pair of opposite sides?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Since the perimeter of the rectangle is 96 feet, we can set up an equation using the formula:

Perimeter = 2(Length) + 2(Width)

Where Length and Width are the lengths of the two pairs of opposite sides.

Given that one pair of opposite sides is 33 feet long, we can substitute this value into the equation:

96 = 2(Length) + 2(33)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

96 = 2(Length) + 66

Subtracting 66 from both sides gives us:

30 = 2(Length)

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

15 = Length

Now that we know the length of one pair of opposite sides is 15 feet, we can find the width by using the same formula:

Perimeter = 2(Length) + 2(Width)

Substituting the values, we get:

96 = 2(15) + 2(Width)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

96 = 30 + 2(Width)

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:

66 = 2(Width)

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

33 = Width

So, the length of the other pair of opposite sides is 33 feet.

The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides, which is 2(length + width). Since the total perimeter is 144 feet, we can set up the equation:

Simplifying the equation, we get:

76 + 2x = 144

Subtracting 76 from both sides gives:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides, which is 4 times the length of one side. Since the perimeter is given as 348m, we can set up the equation:

4s = 348

where s is the length of one side. To solve for s, we can divide both sides by 4:

s = 348/4
s = 87

So, the length of each side of the square is 87m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since it's a square, all sides are equal. Let's call the length of one side &quot;x&quot;. Then, the perimeter is 4x.

We know the perimeter is 400m, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 400

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 400/4
x = 100

The perimeter is 243m, so we can set up the equation: 200m + unknown side = 243m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since the perimeter is 186cm, we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 186

where l is the length of the side that is 50cm long, and w is the length of the other side.

Substituting l = 50, we get:

2(50 + w) = 186

Simplifying the equation, we get:

100 + 2w = 186

Subtracting 100 from both sides, we get:

2w = 86

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

w = 43

So, the other side is 43cm long.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since it's a square, all sides are equal. Let's call the length of each side &quot;x&quot;. Then, the perimeter is 4x.

We know the perimeter is 124m, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 124

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 4:

x = 124/4
x = 31

So, the length of each side is 31m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's use the formula for the perimeter of a quadrilateral:

Perimeter = Sum of all sides

We know the total perimeter is 131m, and we have three sides with lengths 24m, 57m, and 17m. Let's add these up:

24m + 57m + 17m = 98m

Now, we subtract this sum from the total perimeter to find the length of the fourth side:

131m - 98m = 33m

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since the perimeter is 254m, we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 254

where l is the length of one side (89m) and w is the length of the other side.

Substituting l = 89, we get:

2(89 + w) = 254

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

178 + 2w = 254

Subtracting 178 from both sides, we get:

2w = 76

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

w = 38

So, the length of the other side is 38m.

We know the total perimeter is 196 meters, and we're given the lengths of three sides: 92, 29, and 62 meters. We can add these three lengths together to get:

92 + 29 + 62 = 183 meters

This is the total length of three sides, which we're told is 183 meters. Now, we need to find the length of the fourth side.

Since the total perimeter is 196 meters, and we've already accounted for 183 meters, we can subtract 183 from 196 to find the length of the fourth side:

196 - 183 = 13 meters

So, the length of the fourth side is 13 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total perimeter of the quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. We know the total perimeter is 81m, and we know the lengths of three of the sides: 1m, 54m, and 9m. We can set up an equation to represent the total perimeter:

1m + 54m + 9m + x = 81m

where x is the length of the fourth side.

We can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

64m + x = 81m

Subtract 64m from both sides to get:

x = 17m

We know the perimeter is 198m, and we have three sides with lengths 19m, 57m, and 22m. Let's add these up:

19m + 57m + 22m = 98m

Now, we need to find the length of the remaining side. We can set up an equation:

98m + x = 198m

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the length of the shorter sides be x (which is given as 51 meters). Since the perimeter is 158 meters, we can set up the equation:

2x + 2y = 158

where y is the length of the longer sides.

We know that x = 51, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

2(51) + 2y = 158

Simplifying the equation, we get:

102 + 2y = 158

Subtracting 102 from both sides gives us:

2y = 56

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

y = 28

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since the rectangle has two sides measuring 45m each, the total perimeter is 2(45) + 2x, where x is the length of the other two sides.
We know the total perimeter is 210m, so we can set up the equation: 2(45) + 2x = 210.
Simplifying the equation, we get: 90 + 2x = 210.
Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get: 2x = 120.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 60.
So, the length of each of the other two sides is 60m.
