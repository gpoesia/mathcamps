To evaluate this expression, we multiply 6 by 6:

6 Ã— 6 = 36

So, the value of 6 raised to the power of 2 is 36.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: If we raise a single number, say x, to the power of 3, we get:

x Ã— x = x^2
x^2 Ã— x = x^3

So, the result would be x cubed, or x^3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: When a number is raised to a power, it means that the number is multiplied by itself as many times as the value of the power. In this case, 1 is being raised to the 5th power, which means we need to multiply 1 by itself 5 times:

1 Ã— 1 Ã— 1 Ã— 1 Ã— 1 = 1

Since multiplying any number by itself any number of times will always result in the same number, the result of raising 1 to the 5th power is still 1.
