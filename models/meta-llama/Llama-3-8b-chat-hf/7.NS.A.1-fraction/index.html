        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To calculate the sum, we need to find the value of each fraction separately and then add them together.

First, we can simplify the fractions by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator:

49/79 = 7/11 (since 7 is the GCD of 49 and 79)
18/21 = 6/7 (since 6 is the GCD of 18 and 21)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the summation, we need to add the two fractions:

35/97 + 11/9 = ?

First, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 97 and 9 is 873. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 873:

35/97 = 315/873
11/9 = 99/873

Now, we can add the fractions:

315/873 + 99/873 = 414/873

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:

414 Ã· 3 = 138
873 Ã· 3 = 291

So, the simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the division operations:
83 divided by 37 = 83/37 = 2.24
12 divided by 14 = 12/14 = 0.86

Then, we can calculate the subtraction:
2.24 - 0.86 = 1.38

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the sum, we need to first simplify each fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.

For 95/57, the greatest common divisor is 1, so the fraction remains the same.

For 28/80, the greatest common divisor is 4, so we can simplify the fraction to 7/20.

Now, we can add the two fractions:

95/57 + 7/20 = (95*20 + 57*7) / (57*20)
= (1900 + 399) / 1140
= 2299 / 1140

To simplify the fraction further, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

So, the sum is 2299/1140.

            In the previous problem you considered the sum of 95/57 and 28/80, now consider what would happen if you changed the 57 in the denominator of the first fraction to a 21. What would be the new sum of 95/21 and 28/80?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: If we change the denominator of the first fraction from 57 to 21, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

So, 95/57 becomes 95/21.

Now, we can add the two fractions:

95/21 + 28/80 = (95*80 + 21*28) / (21*80)
= (7600 + 616) / 1680
= 8216 / 1680

To simplify the fraction further, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8.

So, the sum is 1027/210.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum, we need to simplify each fraction and then add them together.

First, let's simplify the fractions:

14/57 = 2/9 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 7)
92/42 = 4/3 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2)

Now, we can add the simplified fractions:

2/9 + 4/3 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 9. So, we can rewrite 4/3 as 8/9:

2/9 + 8/9 = 10/9

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We previously calculated the result to be 2.6. To add this to 39/64, we need to convert 2.6 to a fraction:

2.6 = 26/10

Now, we can add 39/64 to 26/10:

(39/64) + (26/10) = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 320. Then, we can convert both fractions:

39/64 = 195/320

26/10 = 104/160 = 91/128 (since 160 is a multiple of 10)

Now, we can add:

195/320 + 91/128 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12800. Then, we can convert both fractions:

195/320 = 2475/12800

91/128 = 1157/12800

To add 46/83 to this result, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 60 and 83 is 2760. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 2760:

828/60 = (828 Ã— 46) / (60 Ã— 46) = 38148/2760
46/83 = (46 Ã— 33) / (83 Ã— 33) = 1512/2760

1. Divide 94 by 35: 94 Ã· 35 = 2 29/35
2. Divide 23 by 49: 23 Ã· 49 = 1/2
3. Subtract 1/2 from 2 29/35:

2 29/35 - 1/2 = 2 29/35 - 0.5

To subtract a fraction from a mixed number, we need to convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:

2 29/35 = 103/35

Now we can subtract:

103/35 - 0.5 = 103/35 - 7/14 (convert 0.5 to a fraction)

= (103/35) - (7/14)

= (103/35) Ã— (14/14) - (7/14)

            Previously you found the sum of 61/20 and 29/15. Now let's change the 15 in the denominator of the second fraction to 67, so that we are adding 61/20 and 29/67. What will the new sum be?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Since the denominator of the second fraction has changed, we need to find a common denominator again. The least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 67 is 20*67 = 1340. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 1340:

61/20 = 3057/1340
29/67 = 203/1340

Now we can add them:

3057/1340 + 203/1340 = 3260/1340

Now, we can add the mixed number 114/4 and the fraction 92/79:

Adding 92/79 to this result:

28 1/2 + 92/79 = 28 1/2 + 1 16/79

To add these mixed numbers, we need to convert them to improper fractions:

28 1/2 = 57/2
1 16/79 = 81/79

Now, we can add the fractions:

57/2 + 81/79 = 114/2 + 81/79

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 158 in this case. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

114/2 = 57/1
81/79 = 103/158

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 94 by 14: 94 / 14 = 6.71 (approximately)
2. Divide 50 by 90: 50 / 90 = 0.555... (approximately)
3. Subtract the two results: 6.71 - 0.555... = 6.155... (approximately)

Since we are asked to simplify the fraction, we can approximate the decimal values:

Thirty-three sevenths can be written as 33/7 = 99/21.

Twenty-nine seventy-ninths can be written as 29/9 = 287/63.

Now, subtract 287/63 from 99/21:

(99/21) - (287/63) = (99/21) - (99*7/63) = (99/21) - (693/63) = 99/21 - 11 = 88/21

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To calculate the sum, we need to first simplify each fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.

For 38/59, the greatest common divisor is 1, so the fraction remains the same.

For 80/94, the greatest common divisor is 2, so we can simplify the fraction to 40/47.

Now, we can calculate the sum:

38/59 + 40/47 = (38/59) + (40/47)

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 1771 (the least common multiple of 59 and 47).

So, we can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator:

38/59 = 228/1771
40/47 = 232/1771

Now, we can add the fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 78 and 83 is 2418. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 2418:

51/78 = 663/2418
44/83 = 532/2418

Now we can add them:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the sum, we need to find the value of each fraction first.

For 64/76, we can simplify it by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.

64 Ã· 4 = 16
76 Ã· 4 = 19

So, 64/76 = 16/19

For 35/33, we can simplify it by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

35 Ã· 1 = 35
33 Ã· 1 = 33

So, 35/33 = 35/33 (already in simplest form)

Now, we can add the two fractions:

16/19 + 35/33

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 57 (the least common multiple of 19 and 33).

16/19 = (16 Ã— 3)/57 = 48/57
35/33 = (35 Ã— 2)/57 = 70/57

Now, we can add:

48/57 + 70/57 = 118/57

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To calculate the sum, we need to first simplify each fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.

For the first fraction, 80/98, the greatest common divisor is 2, so we can simplify it to 40/49.

For the second fraction, 92/82, the greatest common divisor is 2, so we can simplify it to 46/41.

Now, we can calculate the sum:

40/49 + 46/41 = (40*41 + 46*49) / (49*41)
