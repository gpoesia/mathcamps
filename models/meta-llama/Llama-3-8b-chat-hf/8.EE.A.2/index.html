            A child builds a sandcastle in a sandbox. The sandbox has the shape of a cubic box with 512 cubic feet of sand. What is the length of each side of the sandbox in feet?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the sandbox is a cubic box, all sides have the same length. Let's call this length &quot;x&quot;. The volume of the sandbox is given as 512 cubic feet, which is equal to x^3.

We can set up the equation: x^3 = 512

To solve for x, we can take the cube root of both sides: x = ∛512

Using a calculator, we get: x ≈ 8.00

So, the length of each side of the sandbox is approximately 8 feet.

            An artisan carves a cubic fireplace out of stone, which has a volume of 729 cubic feet. What is the length of each side of the fireplace in feet?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of a cube is found by multiplying the length of each side cubed (length × width × height). Since the volume is given as 729 cubic feet, we can set up the equation:

length × width × height = 729

Since it's a cube, all sides are equal, so we can let the length, width, and height be represented by the variable &quot;x&quot;. Then, the equation becomes:

x × x × x = 729

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x³ = 729

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

x = ∛729

x = 9

So, the length of each side of the fireplace is 9 feet.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the barn is a cube, its volume is equal to the length of one side squared, multiplied by itself. We can set up an equation based on this:

side^3 = 1000

To find the length of one side, we can take the cube root of both sides:

side = ∛1000

side = 10

            A giraffe's tank in the zoo is in a cubic shape in order to facilitate its movement. The volume of the tank is 512 m^3. If all sides of the tank are equal in size, what is the size of one side of the tank in meters?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the tank is a cube, its volume is equal to the cube of its side length. We can set up an equation using the formula for the volume of a cube (V = s^3), where V is the volume and s is the side length.

512 = s^3

To find the side length, we can take the cube root of both sides of the equation:

s = ∛512

Using a calculator, we get:

s ≈ 8.07

So, the size of one side of the tank is approximately 8.07 meters.

            A mountain has a cuboidal shape and its volume is 64 km^3. If all of the sides of this cuboid are of equal length, what is the length of each side in kilometers?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of a cuboid is given by the formula V = l × w × h, where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height of the cuboid, respectively. Since the sides of the cuboid are of equal length, we can let l = w = h = x. Then, the volume equation becomes V = x × x × x = x^3.

Given that the volume is 64 km^3, we can set up the equation x^3 = 64 and solve for x.

x^3 = 64
x = ∛64
x = 4

So, the length of each side of the cuboid is 4 kilometers.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of each edge. We are given that the volume is 512 cubic kilometers, so we can set up the equation:

512 = s^3

To solve for s, we can take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛512

Using a calculator, we get:

s ≈ 8.0

So, the length of each edge of the crater is approximately 8.0 kilometers.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the baby is building a cube, the total number of blocks is equal to the cube of the length of one side. We can set up the equation:

343 = x^3

where x is the length of one side of the cube.

To solve for x, we can take the cube root of both sides:

x = ∛343

x = 7

So, the length of one side of the cube is 7 blocks.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the substance is in a cubic container, the volume of the substance is equal to the length of one side of the container cubed. In other words, the volume is equal to the length × length × length.

Let's call the length of one side of the container &quot;x&quot;. Then, the volume of the substance is x × x × x = x³.

We know that the volume of the substance is 512 cubic feet, so we can set up the equation:

x³ = 512

To solve for x, we can take the cube root of both sides:

x = ∛512

x = 8

So, the length of one side of the cubic container is 8 feet.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the length of one side of the cube is x centimeters. Then, the volume of the cube is x^3 cubic centimeters.
Since each cubic centimeter holds 1 milliliter of nectar, the total volume of the cube in milliliters is x^3 cubic centimeters * 1 milliliter/cubic centimeter = x^3 milliliters.
We know that the total volume of the cube is 125 milliliters, so we can set up the equation x^3 = 125.
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get x = ∛125 = 3.57 (approximately).
Since the length of one side of the cube must be a whole number of centimeters, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3 centimeters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of each edge. We are given that the volume is 1000 cubic millimeters, so we can set up the equation:

1000 = s^3

To solve for s, we can take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛1000

Using a calculator, we get:

s ≈ 10

So, the length of each edge of the bracelet is approximately 10 millimeters.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of a cube is found by multiplying the length of each edge by itself three times (length × width × height = volume). Since the volume of the yew tree is 216 cubic meters, we can set up the equation:

edge × edge × edge = 216

To find the length of each edge, we can take the cube root of both sides of the equation:

edge = ∛216

Using a calculator, we get:

edge = 6

So, the length of each edge of the yew tree is 6 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the blanket is folded in a perfect cube shape, all sides are equal. Let's call the length of each side &quot;x&quot;. The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the length of each side cubed (x^3). In this case, the volume is 1000 cubic cm, so we can set up the equation:

x^3 = 1000

To find the value of x, we can take the cube root of both sides:

x = ∛1000

To find the length of the side, we need to find the cube root of 125. This can be done using a calculator or by finding the perfect cube of a number that is close to 125.

125 = 5^3

So, the length of each side of the bottle is 5 centimeters.

When the volume of the building is calculated, it comes out to be 216 cubic meters. If the building height, width and depth are all equal, what is the length in meters of one side?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the building has a uniform cross-sectional area, the area of the cross-section is equal to the width times the depth. Let's call the width and depth &quot;x&quot;. Then, the area of the cross-section is x^2.

The volume of the building is the area of the cross-section multiplied by the height. Since the height, width, and depth are all equal, let's call the height &quot;x&quot; as well. Then, the volume is x^2 * x = x^3.

We know the volume is 216 cubic meters, so we can set up the equation x^3 = 216. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get x = ∛216 = 6.

So, the length of one side is 6 meters.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the slide is a cuboid with the same length, width, and height, the volume can be represented as:

Volume = Length × Width × Height

Given that the volume is 1000 cubic feet, we can set up an equation:

Length × Width × Height = 1000

Since the length, width, and height are equal, we can let x be the length (and also the width and height). Then, the equation becomes:

x × x × x = 1000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x³ = 1000

Taking the cube root of both sides:

x = ∛1000

x ≈ 10

So, the length of one side of the slide is approximately 10 feet.

            A magical hat inflates into the shape of a perfect cube. When fully inflated, its volume measures 27 cubic centimeters. Can you figure out the length of one edge of the hat when it is fully inflated?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the hat is a perfect cube, its volume is equal to the cube of its edge length. We can set up an equation using the volume and the edge length:

Volume = Edge^3
27 = Edge^3

To find the edge length, we can take the cube root of both sides:

Edge = ∛27

Using a calculator, we get:

Edge = 3

So, the length of one edge of the hat when it is fully inflated is 3 centimeters.

The total number of grapes in the container is 27, which is the volume of the cube. The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the number of grapes on each side (x) cubed: x^3 = 27.

To find the value of x, we take the cube root of both sides: x = ∛27.

Using a calculator, we get: x ≈ 3.

So, each side of the cube holds approximately 3 grapes.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the container is a cube, all its sides have the same length. The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself twice (length × width × height = volume). In this case, the volume is given as 216 cubic meters, so we can set up the equation:

side × side × side = 216

To simplify the equation, we can take the cube root of both sides:

side × side = ∛216

side = √(∛216)

side = √(6)

side = 2.4495 (approximately)

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the length of each side of the cube is x.

Since the cube is a 3D shape, the total number of flowers used is equal to the number of flowers on each side, which is x^3.

We know that the total number of flowers used is 125, so we can set up the equation:

x^3 = 125

To solve for x, we can take the cube root of both sides:

x = ∛125

x = 5

So, the length of each side of the flower cube is 5.

Let's say the length of one side is s. Then, we can set up the equation:

27 = s^3

To solve for s, we can take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛27

s = 3

So, the length of one side of the cargo hold is 3 meters.

The alphabet starts from 'a' (position 1) to 'z' (position 26). To find the letter at position 27, we need to add 1 to 26, which gives us 27.
The letter at position 27 is 'aa' (since 'a' is the 1st letter and 'a' is the 26th letter). However, the problem statement says that the number corresponds to a number obtained by cubing a letter's position in the alphabet. This means we need to find the letter whose position is 3 (since 3^3 = 27).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's denote the length of the object as L. Since the temperature at the heart of the object is directly proportional to the cube of its length, we can write:

Temperature ∝ L^3

We know that the temperature is 729 degrees, so we can set up the equation:

729 = kL^3

where k is the constant of proportionality.

To find the length L, we can divide both sides of the equation by k and take the cube root of both sides:

L = ∛(729/k)

Since we don't know the value of k, we cannot find the exact length of the object. However, we can express the length in terms of k.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of each edge. We are given that the volume is 8 cubic light years, so we can set up the equation:

8 = s^3

To solve for s, we can take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛8

Using a calculator, we get:

s ≈ 2.08

So, the length of each edge of the star is approximately 2.08 light years.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the length of each side of the cubical chamber is x. Since the chamber is filled with the dolphin's calls, the total volume of the calls is equal to the volume of the chamber, which is x^3.

We are given that the intensity of the call's volume is effectively 1 unit^3, which means that the total volume of the calls is 1 unit^3. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x^3 = 1

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

x = ∛1

x = 1

So, the length of each side of the cubical chamber is 1 unit.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the roller skate is a cube, all its sides have the same length. Let's call this length &quot;s&quot;. The volume of a cube is found by cubing its side length, so we can set up the equation:

s³ = 216

To find the value of s, we need to find the cube root of 216. This can be done using a calculator or by finding the perfect cube of a number that equals 216.

216 = 6³

So, s = 6

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the tank is a cube, all its sides have the same length. Let's call this length &quot;x&quot;. The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the length of each side cubed (x^3). In this case, the volume is given as 343 cubic meters.

So, we can set up the equation: x^3 = 343

To solve for x, we can take the cube root of both sides: x = ∛343

Using a calculator, we get: x ≈ 7

We know that the volume of the cube is 1000 cubic centimeters, so we can set up the equation:

x^3 = 1000

To find the value of x, we can take the cube root of both sides of the equation:

x = ∛1000

x = 10

So, the length of the edge of the flower cube is 10 centimeters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the treasure chest is a cube, its volume is equal to the length of each side cubed (V = s^3). We are given that the volume is 125 cubic feet, so we can set up the equation:

125 = s^3

To solve for s, we can take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛125

s = 5

So, the length of each side of the treasure chest is 5 feet.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the fish tank is a cube, all its sides have the same length. Let's call this length &quot;x&quot;. The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying the length of each side cubed, so we can set up the equation:

x^3 = 1 cubic meter

To find the length of each side, we need to find the cube root of 1 cubic meter. Since 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters, we can convert it to meters:

1 cubic meter = 1000 liters = 1000/1000 = 1 meter

So, the length of each side is:

x = ∛1 = ∛(1 meter) = 1 meter

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the volume of a cube is equal to the length of one side squared, we can set up the equation:

125 = s^3

where s is the length of one side of the cube.

To find the length of one side, we take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛125

s = 3.684

Since the length of one side cannot be a decimal, we round it to the nearest whole number:

s ≈ 4

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the box is cubical, all sides have the same length. Let's call this length &quot;x&quot;. The volume of the box is the product of the length, width, and height, which is x^3. Since the volume is given as 1 cubic foot, we can set up the equation:

x^3 = 1

To solve for x, we take the cube root of both sides:

x = ∛1

x = 1

So, the length of a side of this box is 1 foot.
