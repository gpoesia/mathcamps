            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of whole wheels of cheese Farmer Brown can make, we need to divide the total number of blocks he has (42) by the number of blocks required to make one wheel (7).

            After making the cheese wheels, Farmer Brown decides to double his production in order to have enough for the upcoming village fair. Based on his current production rate, how many cheese wheels will he have after doubling his output?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since Farmer Brown can currently make 6 wheels of cheese with the 42 blocks he has, his current production rate is 6 wheels per 42 blocks.

To double his production, he will need to produce twice as many wheels, which is 2 x 6 = 12 wheels.

Since his current production rate is 6 wheels per 42 blocks, to produce 12 wheels, he will need:

12 Ã· 6 = 2 times more blocks

So, he will need 2 x 42 = 84 blocks to produce 12 wheels.

Since he already has 42 blocks, he will need to make:

84 - 42 = 42 more blocks

After making these additional blocks, he will have a total of:

42 + 42 = 84 blocks

With these 84 blocks, he can make:

84 Ã· 7 = 12 wheels

So, after doubling his production, Farmer Brown will have 12 wheels of cheese.

Since she can't put 2 cookies in a bag, she will have 1 full bag with 7 cookies and 2 cookies left over.
For the camping trip, she wants to multiply the number of bags by 6, so we multiply 1 by 6: 1*6 = 6.

            In retrospect, Jane realized that she had initially given 6 filters to each camera instead of 10. If she continued to distribute the filters equally between her 5 cameras, how many filters would each camera get initially?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since Jane initially gave 6 filters to each camera, the total number of filters given is:

6 x 5 = 30

However, she only had 10 filters initially. This means she has 30 - 10 = 20 filters left over.

To distribute the remaining filters equally among the 5 cameras, we can divide the remaining filters (20) by the number of cameras (5):

20 Ã· 5 = 4

Each camera would get 4 filters initially.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Maya cut the line segment into equal parts, each 7 cm long. To find the number of segments, we can divide the initial length of the line segment (15 cm) by the length of each segment (7 cm).

15 cm Ã· 7 cm = 2.14 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a segment, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Maya would have obtained 2 segments if she cut the 15 cm line into equal pieces of 7 cm each.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Jack starts with 5 apples, and he multiplies it by 6 to get the total number of oranges. Multiplying 5 by 6 gives us 5 x 6 = 30.

However, the problem states that Jack can trade his apples for oranges, not that he can get oranges by multiplying his apples. This means that the multiplication is not applicable in this scenario.

To find the correct answer, we need to know the number of oranges Jack can get for each apple. Let's assume he can get x oranges for each apple. Then, he can get 5x oranges for his 5 apples.

Since Jack wants to know the total number of oranges he can get, we need to find the value of x. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide this information, so we cannot determine the exact number of oranges Jack can get.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John wants to divide his camping area of 44 square meters into 11 equal sections. To find the area of each section, we can divide 44 by 11: 44 Ã· 11 = 4 square meters per section.
Since each section can host a tent, and each tent can accommodate 12 campers, we can multiply the number of sections by the number of campers per section: 11 sections Ã— 12 campers/section = 132 campers.
