        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's call the length of each side of the equilateral triangle &quot;x&quot;. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all three sides have the same length. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, which is 3x.

We are given that the perimeter is 990cm, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 990

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 990/3
x = 330

So, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 330cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides.

We know the perimeter is 997m, and we know two of the sides have lengths 2m and 667m. So, we can set up the equation:

997 = 2 + 667 + c

Subtract 2 and 667 from both sides:

997 - 2 - 667 = c

c = 328

So, the length of the third side is 328m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's call the length of each side of the equilateral triangle &quot;x&quot;. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all three sides have the same length. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, which is 3x.

We are given that the perimeter is 594 cm, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 594

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 594 Ã· 3
x = 198

So, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 198 cm.

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides.

We know the total perimeter is 898m, and we know the lengths of two of the sides (250m and 435m). We can set up an equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's call the length of each side of the equilateral triangle &quot;x&quot;. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all three sides have the same length. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, which is 3x.

We are given that the perimeter is 714m, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 714

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 714 Ã· 3
x = 238

Perimeter = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides.

We are given that the perimeter is 991m, and two of the sides are 424m and 246m. We can set up an equation:

424 + 246 + c = 991

Combine like terms:

670 + c = 991

Subtract 670 from both sides:

c = 991 - 670

c = 321

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides.

We know the perimeter is 989m, and we know two of the sides are 128m and 288m long. So, we can set up the equation:

128 + 288 + c = 989

Combine like terms:

416 + c = 989

Subtract 416 from both sides:

c = 989 - 416

c = 573

So, the length of the third side is 573m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides.

We know the perimeter is 850m, and we know two of the sides have lengths 57m and 426m. So, we can set up the equation:

850 = 57 + 426 + c

Now, we can simplify the equation by combining the known side lengths:

850 = 483 + c

Subtract 483 from both sides to get:

367 = c

So, the length of the third side is 367m.

The perimeter of the triangle is 934m, which means the sum of the lengths of all three sides is 934m.

We know the lengths of two sides: one is 828m and the other is 10m. Let's add these two lengths together:

828m + 10m = 838m

This is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two sides mentioned in the problem, which is 838m. Now, we can set up an equation:

828m + 10m + x = 934m

where x is the length of the third side.

Combine like terms:

838m + x = 934m

Subtract 838m from both sides:

x = 934m - 838m

x = 96m

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's call the length of each side of the equilateral triangle &quot;x&quot;. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all three sides have the same length. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides, which is 3x.

We are given that the perimeter is 891cm, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 891

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 891 Ã· 3
x = 297

So, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 297cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides.

We know the perimeter is 930 meters, and we know two of the sides are 537 meters and 68 meters. We can plug these values into the formula:

930 = 537 + 68 + c

First, let's add the known sides:

930 = 605 + c

Now, subtract 605 from both sides:

930 - 605 = c

c = 325

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:

Perimeter = a + b + c

where a, b, and c are the lengths of the three sides.

We know the total perimeter is 739 meters, and we know two of the sides are 180 meters and 338 meters. We can set up an equation:

180 + 338 + c = 739

Combine like terms:

518 + c = 739

Subtract 518 from both sides:

c = 221

So, the length of the third side is 221 meters.
