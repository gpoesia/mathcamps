            During the drummer's next performance, he manages to play a total of 906 beats. If he played exactly the same solo as the last time when he missed 39 beats from a total of 379, how many additional beats did he add to his performance this time?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's first find out how many beats the drummer played in the solo last time:

379 (total beats) - 39 (missed beats) = 340

This time, the drummer played a total of 906 beats. To find out how many additional beats he added, we need to subtract the number of beats he played last time from the total number of beats this time:

906 (total beats this time) - 340 (beats played last time) = 566

However, this includes the 379 beats from the original solo. To find the additional beats, we need to subtract the original 379 beats from 566:

566 - 379 = 187

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The total weight of the sand after the morning's addition was 604 pounds. The management decided to remove an equal amount of sand as was initially present, which is 336 pounds.

To find the amount of sand left, we need to subtract the removed amount from the total amount:

Amount of sand left = Total amount - Removed amount
= 604 - 336
= 268

To find the number of planes that were able to be handled, we need to subtract the number of planes that couldn't take off or land from the total number of planes.

Total planes handled normally = 943
Planes that couldn't take off or land = 773

Planes handled that day = Total planes handled normally - Planes that couldn't take off or land

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of grapes the farmer sold is x. Since he had 874 grapes initially and 748 grapes left after selling, we can set up the equation:

874 - x = 748

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

874 = 748 + x

Subtracting 748 from both sides gives us:

126 = x

So, the farmer sold 126 grapes at the market.

            Previously, the farmer had sold a certain amount of grapes. Let's consider a different scenario where he had 874 grapes to begin with, but after selling some at the local market, he had 802 left instead. In this case, how many grapes did the farmer sell at the market?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of grapes the farmer sold is x. Since he had 874 grapes initially and 802 grapes left after selling, we can set up the equation:

874 - x = 802

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

874 = 802 + x

Subtracting 802 from both sides gives us:

72 = x

So, the farmer sold 72 grapes at the market.

We know that the total number of words is 318, so we can set up the equation: x + 104 = 318.
Subtracting 104 from both sides gives us: x = 318 - 104 = 214.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step!

We know the length of the first rope is 623 meters.

The total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope, so we can set up an equation:

Total length = Length of first rope + 377
Total length = 623 + 377

Now, let's add 623 and 377:

Total length = 1000

So, the total length of the two ropes is 1000 meters.

            Considering that Jack is a professional mountain climber, he uses 623 meters of his rope on a massive mountain. He then buys an additional rope, ending up with a total length of 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, Jack has to use 675 meters of the combined length of rope in a rescue mission. How much length of rope does Jack have left now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's work through this step by step!

Initially, Jack uses 623 meters of his rope, leaving him with:

623 - 623 = 0 meters of the original rope

Then, he buys an additional rope, ending up with a total length of 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. This means the total length of the combined ropes is:

623 + 377 = 1000 meters

Now, Jack uses 675 meters of the combined length of rope in a rescue mission. To find out how much rope he has left, we subtract the used length from the total length:

1000 - 675 = 325 meters

So, Jack has 325 meters of rope left now.

            Now, let's change the scenario a bit. Suppose originally, Jack had a shorter rope that was 472 meters long. Like before, he buys an additional rope, making the total length of both ropes 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. What is the total length of the two ropes in this situation?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's work through it again!

We know the length of the first rope is 472 meters.

The total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope, so we can set up an equation:

Total length = Length of first rope + 377
Total length = 472 + 377

Now, let's add 472 and 377:

Total length = 849

So, the total length of the two ropes is 849 meters.

            A kite festival had 577 kites in the sky at its peak. After some time, 256 kites were taken down. How many kites remained in the sky?

            After the kite festival, the organizers brought an additional 316 kites to add to the ones that remained in the sky. How many kites were there in total after the organizers finished adding the additional kites?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that 321 kites remained in the sky after some kites were taken down. Now, the organizers are adding 316 more kites to the ones that remained.

To find the total number of kites, we add the number of kites that remained to the additional kites:

321 + 316 = 637

            Let's say originally, there were actually 855 kites in the sky at the beginning of the kite festival instead of 577. After the same number of 256 kites were taken down, how many kites would have remained in the sky?
