        A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down into two parts:

Part 1: 
The company has 2840 socks to package, and they package them in sets of 40. To find out how many packs they can make, we can divide the total number of socks by 40:
2840 รท 40 = 71

So, they can make 71 new packs of socks. Adding these to the 93 packs they already have, they will have a total of:
93 + 71 = 164

Part 2:
The company receives another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but they have to return 8 due to quality issues. To find out how many packs they have now, we can add the new shipment to the total they already had, and then subtract the packs they returned:
164 + 70 = 234
234 - 8 = 226

        A gardener has a field where he planted 80 rose bushes, with each bush producing 30 roses. Before he is able to gather them, a storm blows away 43 roses. How many roses are remaining in the field?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The gardener has 80 rose bushes, each producing 30 roses, so the total number of roses is 80 x 30 = 2400 roses.

How many roses does he actually have remaining in the field after the correction?

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the farmer has 38 equally productive grape vines, we can find the total number of grapes produced by all the vines by multiplying the number of grapes produced by one vine by 38.

Let's say each vine produces x grapes. Then, the total number of grapes produced by all the vines is 38x.

We know that the total number of grapes produced is 3344. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

38x = 3344

To find the number of grapes produced by each vine, we can divide both sides of the equation by 38:

x = 3344 รท 38
x = 88

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the farmer has 75 equally productive grape vines, and the total number of grapes produced is still 3344, we can set up the equation:

75x = 3344

where x is the number of grapes produced by each vine.

To find the number of grapes produced by each vine, we can divide both sides of the equation by 75:

x = 3344 รท 75
x = 44.59 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a grape, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each vine would have produced approximately 44 grapes.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We are given that the machinery fills 3840 bottles every 18 hours. To find the number of bottles filled per hour, we can divide the number of bottles filled by the time it takes to fill them.

3840 bottles รท 18 hours = 3840 รท 18 = 213.33 bottles/hour (approximately)

Since we can't fill a fraction of a bottle, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

Initially, the kite maker has:
41 blue kites + 63 red kites + 57 green kites = 161 kites

The kite maker gives away 98 kites, so they are left with:
161 - 98 = 63 kites

Then, the kite maker creates an additional 3 kites, so they now have:
63 + 3 = 66 kites

The kite maker currently has 66 kites.

They decide to multiply their current inventory by 18, so they will have:
66 ร 18 = 1188 kites

Then, they add the original inventory to this increased production, which means they add the 161 kites they had initially:
1188 + 161 = 1349 kites

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first calculate the distance traveled by the train at the original speed:

Distance = Speed ร Time = 68 mph ร 21 hours = 1428 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by the train at the reduced speed:

Distance = Speed ร Time = 28 mph ร 21 hours = 588 miles

To find the impact on the total distance traveled, we'll subtract the distance traveled at the reduced speed from the distance traveled at the original speed:

Impact on distance = 1428 miles - 588 miles = 840 miles

        The cafรฉ also has another branch. If the other branch also made the same amount of money from selling hot chocolate and marshmallows in a day, what would be the total revenue from both branches?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the other branch also made the same amount of money, we can simply add the revenue from both branches.
The total revenue from one branch is 3334 dollars.
The total revenue from both branches is 2 x 3334 = 6668 dollars.

        Suppose that on another day, the cafรฉ priced their hot chocolate differently: they sold it for 42 dollars per cup but only sold 78 cups, and made an additional 24 dollars from selling marshmallows. What would be the total revenue of that day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The cafรฉ sold 78 cups of hot chocolate at 42 dollars per cup, so the revenue from hot chocolate is 78 x 42 = 3276 dollars.
The revenue from selling marshmallows is 24 dollars.
The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from hot chocolate and marshmallows, which is 3276 + 24 = 3300 dollars.

1. The factory makes 13 blankets in the morning and 81 in the afternoon, so they make a total of 13 + 81 = 94 blankets.
2. However, they return 59 due to defects, so they have 94 - 59 = 35 good blankets left.
3. The price of each blanket is equal to 39 times the total number of good blankets, plus the number of good blankets. So, the price of each blanket is 39 ร 35 + 35 = 1440.

Just like the previous day, by midday, he managed to harvest some more, bringing the total to 95 + 82 tomatoes in the basket. Unfortunately, he found that 37 of these tomatoes were not ripe enough to sell. How many ripe tomatoes did the farmer have left in his basket after this day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The farmer starts with 95 tomatoes and harvests 82 more, so he has a total of 95 + 82 = 177 tomatoes.
After removing 37 unsellable tomatoes, he is left with 177 - 37 = 140 tomatoes that are ripe and ready to sell.

        In a soap manufacturing factory, they create soap in large blocks that are then cut into smaller bars. If each large block can be cut into 1424 bars of soap, but they package the soap in bundles of 16 bars each, how many packages can they make from one large block of soap?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of packages, we need to divide the total number of bars by the number of bars in each package.

Let's divide the total number of bars (1424) by the number of bars in each package (36):

1424 รท 36 = 39.55

Since we can't have a fraction of a package, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. This is because we can't make a fraction of a package, and we can't leave any bars unpackaged.

So, they can make 39 packages from one large block of soap under this new arrangement.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The farm produces 12 tons of potatoes per acre, and they have a 3 acre plot of land. So, they produced 12 x 3 = 36 tons of potatoes in total.

Out of the 36 tons, 71 tons were rotten, but that's not possible since they only produced 36 tons. It's likely that 71 tons is a typo and it should be 7 tons. Let's assume that's the case.

If 7 tons were rotten, they were left with 36 - 7 = 29 tons. But they could salvage 44 tons, which means they were able to recover 44 tons from the rotten potatoes.

So, in total, they have 29 tons (good potatoes) + 44 tons (recovered potatoes) = 73 tons of potatoes left.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's break this down step by step. Mary's plant produces as many cucumbers as John's, but minus the difference between John's cucumbers and 73. This means we need to find the difference between John's cucumbers (59) and 73.

The difference between 59 and 73 is 73 - 59 = 14.

Now, Mary's plant produces as many cucumbers as John's, but minus this difference. So, we subtract 14 from John's cucumbers: 59 - 14 = 45.

        Following the previous scenario, suppose the paleontologists revised their calculations and found that the dinosaur species was actually laying eggs every 47 minutes, not 60 as originally thought. In that case, how many total eggs would the dinosaur have laid if it had been laying eggs for 1620 minutes straight?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the dinosaur species laid eggs every 47 minutes, we can find the total number of eggs laid by dividing the total time (1620 minutes) by the time interval between eggs (47 minutes).

1620 minutes รท 47 minutes = 34.47 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of an egg, we round down to the nearest whole number, as the dinosaur can't lay a fraction of an egg.

34.47 โ 34

This means the dinosaur species laid 34 eggs in 1620 minutes.

        Building on our beachcomber's tale, after counting his 42-day collection of seashells, he accidentally loses one seashell down a seaside crevice. Disappointed but not defeated, he decides to collect 32 more seashells the next day. How many seashells does he have in total after adding the new batch and accounting for the lost seashell?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The beachcomber had 3164 seashells initially.
He lost 1 seashell, so he had 3164 - 1 = 3163 seashells left.
The next day, he collected 32 more seashells, so he now has 3163 + 32 = 3195 seashells.

        Let's revisit our beachcomber. After reconsidering his collection habit, he realizes he has been actually collecting an average of 89 seashells per day instead of 74, over the same 42 day period. He still found that additional 56 seashells hidden in the sand. Now, how many seashells does he have in total after 42 days?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The beachcomber collected 89 seashells per day for 42 days, so the total number of seashells collected is 89 x 42 = 3738.
The beachcomber also found 56 additional seashells, so the total number of seashells is 3738 + 56 = 3794.
