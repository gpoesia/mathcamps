        A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down into two parts:

Part 1: 
The company has 2840 socks to package, and they package them in sets of 40. To find out how many packs they can make, we can divide the total number of socks by 40:
2840 ÷ 40 = 71

So, they can make 71 new packs of socks. Adding these to the 93 packs they already have, they will have a total of:
93 + 71 = 164

Part 2:
The company receives another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but they have to return 8 due to quality issues. To find out how many packs they have now, we can add the new shipment to the total they already had, and then subtract the packs they returned:
164 + 70 = 234
234 - 8 = 226

        A gardener has a field where he planted 80 rose bushes, with each bush producing 30 roses. Before he is able to gather them, a storm blows away 43 roses. How many roses are remaining in the field?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The gardener has 80 rose bushes, each producing 30 roses, so the total number of roses is 80 x 30 = 2400 roses.

        The gardener realizes afterwards that he initially miscounted the rose bushes in the field.

How many roses does he actually have remaining in the field after the correction?

        A farmer's grape vine produces 3344 grapes, and he has 38 equally productive grape vines. How many grapes does each vine produce?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the farmer has 38 equally productive grape vines, we can find the total number of grapes produced by all the vines by multiplying the number of grapes produced by one vine by 38.

Let's say each vine produces x grapes. Then, the total number of grapes produced by all the vines is 38x.

We know that the total number of grapes produced is 3344. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

38x = 3344

To find the number of grapes produced by each vine, we can divide both sides of the equation by 38:

x = 3344 ÷ 38
x = 88

So, each vine produces 88 grapes.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the farmer has 75 equally productive grape vines, and the total number of grapes produced is still 3344, we can set up the equation:

75x = 3344

where x is the number of grapes produced by each vine.

To find the number of grapes produced by each vine, we can divide both sides of the equation by 75:

x = 3344 ÷ 75
x = 44.59 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a grape, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each vine would have produced approximately 44 grapes.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The farmer has 3069 grapes and puts 33 grapes in each bag, so he will have 3069 ÷ 33 = 93 bags of grapes initially.

The farmer eats 13 bags and gives away 50 bags, so he has 93 - (13 + 50) = 93 - 63 = 30 bags of grapes left.

        Following the previous scenario, suppose the farmer decides to change his approach and now puts 25 grapes in each bag instead of 33. He again eats 13 bags and gives away 50 bags. How many bags of grapes does the farmer have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The farmer has 3069 grapes and puts 25 grapes in each bag, so he will have 3069 ÷ 25 = 122.76 bags of grapes initially. Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we round down to 122 bags.

The farmer eats 13 bags and gives away 50 bags, so he has 122 - (13 + 50) = 122 - 63 = 59 bags of grapes left.

3840 bottles ÷ 18 hours = 3840 ÷ 18 = 213.33 bottles/hour (approximately)

Since we can't fill a fraction of a bottle, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

The kite maker gives away 98 kites, so they are left with:
161 - 98 = 63 kites

Then, the kite maker creates an additional 3 kites, so they now have:
63 + 3 = 66 kites

The kite maker currently has 66 kites.

They decide to multiply their current inventory by 18, so they will have:
66 × 18 = 1188 kites

Then, they add the original inventory to this increased production, which means they add the 161 kites they had initially:
1188 + 161 = 1349 kites

7644 ÷ 50 = 152.88

Since we can't produce a fraction of a teddy bear, we can round up or down to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can round to 153.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first calculate the distance traveled by the train at the original speed:

Distance = Speed × Time = 68 mph × 21 hours = 1428 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by the train at the reduced speed:

Distance = Speed × Time = 28 mph × 21 hours = 588 miles

To find the impact on the total distance traveled, we'll subtract the distance traveled at the reduced speed from the distance traveled at the original speed:

Impact on distance = 1428 miles - 588 miles = 840 miles

So, the train traveled 840 miles less due to the speed restriction.

        The café also has another branch. If the other branch also made the same amount of money from selling hot chocolate and marshmallows in a day, what would be the total revenue from both branches?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the other branch also made the same amount of money, we can simply add the revenue from both branches.
The total revenue from one branch is 3334 dollars.
The total revenue from both branches is 2 x 3334 = 6668 dollars.

        Suppose that on another day, the café priced their hot chocolate differently: they sold it for 42 dollars per cup but only sold 78 cups, and made an additional 24 dollars from selling marshmallows. What would be the total revenue of that day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The café sold 78 cups of hot chocolate at 42 dollars per cup, so the revenue from hot chocolate is 78 x 42 = 3276 dollars.
The revenue from selling marshmallows is 24 dollars.
The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from hot chocolate and marshmallows, which is 3276 + 24 = 3300 dollars.

30 bananas + 16 extra bananas = 46 bananas
46 bananas + 79 more bananas = 125 bananas

Then, 67 bananas were stolen, so we subtract these from the total:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The factory makes 13 blankets in the morning and 81 in the afternoon, so they make a total of 13 + 81 = 94 blankets.
2. However, they return 59 due to defects, so they have 94 - 59 = 35 good blankets left.
3. The price of each blanket is equal to 39 times the total number of good blankets, plus the number of good blankets. So, the price of each blanket is 39 × 35 + 35 = 1440.

Since there are 43 stores that received the initial shipment, and 57 stores that received the second shipment, we can assume that the 43 stores are a subset of the 57 stores. Therefore, each of the 43 stores that received the initial shipment also received the additional 72 binoculars from the second shipment.

        In a soap manufacturing factory, they create soap in large blocks that are then cut into smaller bars. If each large block can be cut into 1424 bars of soap, but they package the soap in bundles of 16 bars each, how many packages can they make from one large block of soap?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of packages, we need to divide the total number of bars by the number of bars in each package.

Let's divide the total number of bars (1424) by the number of bars in each package (36):

1424 ÷ 36 = 39.55

Since we can't have a fraction of a package, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. This is because we can't make a fraction of a package, and we can't leave any bars unpackaged.

So, they can make 39 packages from one large block of soap under this new arrangement.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The farm produces 12 tons of potatoes per acre, and they have a 3 acre plot of land. So, they produced 12 x 3 = 36 tons of potatoes in total.

Out of the 36 tons, 71 tons were rotten, but that's not possible since they only produced 36 tons. It's likely that 71 tons is a typo and it should be 7 tons. Let's assume that's the case.

If 7 tons were rotten, they were left with 36 - 7 = 29 tons. But they could salvage 44 tons, which means they were able to recover 44 tons from the rotten potatoes.

So, in total, they have 29 tons (good potatoes) + 44 tons (recovered potatoes) = 73 tons of potatoes left.

        Following on from the previous problem: The pirate made a mistake while counting his treasure. He originally thought that he had found 91 gold coins on another island, but it turned out there were only 9 gold coins. With the 22 coins he found on an island, 9 on another island, and 33 hidden in a chest, how many coins does the pirate have now?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The pirate found 22 gold coins on the island. He had 9 gold coins from another island (not 91, as he previously thought). He also had 33 gold coins hidden in a chest. To find the total number of gold coins, we add these three amounts together: 22 + 9 + 33 = 64.

        Following up on the previous situation with John and Mary, suppose now that Mary's cucumber plant produces as many cucumbers as John's but minus the difference between John's cucumbers and 73. How many cucumbers did Mary's plant produce this time?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's break this down step by step. Mary's plant produces as many cucumbers as John's, but minus the difference between John's cucumbers and 73. This means we need to find the difference between John's cucumbers (59) and 73.

The difference between 59 and 73 is 73 - 59 = 14.

Now, Mary's plant produces as many cucumbers as John's, but minus this difference. So, we subtract 14 from John's cucumbers: 59 - 14 = 45.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Following the previous scenario, suppose the paleontologists revised their calculations and found that the dinosaur species was actually laying eggs every 47 minutes, not 60 as originally thought. In that case, how many total eggs would the dinosaur have laid if it had been laying eggs for 1620 minutes straight?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the dinosaur species laid eggs every 47 minutes, we can find the total number of eggs laid by dividing the total time (1620 minutes) by the time interval between eggs (47 minutes).

1620 minutes ÷ 47 minutes = 34.47 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of an egg, we round down to the nearest whole number, as the dinosaur can't lay a fraction of an egg.

34.47 ≈ 34

This means the dinosaur species laid 34 eggs in 1620 minutes.

        On a particular beach, there is a tendency for 74 seashells to appear every day. After 42 days of collection, a beachcomber also discovered an additional 56 seashells that had been hidden in the sand. How many seashells did the beachcomber have in total after 42 days?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The beachcomber collected 74 seashells per day for 42 days, so the total number of seashells collected is 74 x 42 = 3108.

        Building on our beachcomber's tale, after counting his 42-day collection of seashells, he accidentally loses one seashell down a seaside crevice. Disappointed but not defeated, he decides to collect 32 more seashells the next day. How many seashells does he have in total after adding the new batch and accounting for the lost seashell?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The beachcomber had 3164 seashells initially.
He lost 1 seashell, so he had 3164 - 1 = 3163 seashells left.
The next day, he collected 32 more seashells, so he now has 3163 + 32 = 3195 seashells.

        Let's revisit our beachcomber. After reconsidering his collection habit, he realizes he has been actually collecting an average of 89 seashells per day instead of 74, over the same 42 day period. He still found that additional 56 seashells hidden in the sand. Now, how many seashells does he have in total after 42 days?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The beachcomber collected 89 seashells per day for 42 days, so the total number of seashells collected is 89 x 42 = 3738.
The beachcomber also found 56 additional seashells, so the total number of seashells is 3738 + 56 = 3794.
