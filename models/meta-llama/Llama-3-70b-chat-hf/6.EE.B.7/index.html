            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The problem doesn't specify the number of red balls already in the bag, but it asks how many red balls should be added to make the total number of balls 355. Let's assume there are no red balls initially. Since there are already 44 green balls, we need to add enough red balls to make the total 355.

Let's subtract the number of green balls from the total: 355 - 44 = 311

So, 311 red balls should be added to the bag.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say there are x mice in the group. Since each mouse needs 104 food units, the total food units required by the group is 104x. We know that the group requires 7592 units of food, so we can set up the equation:

104x = 7592

To find the number of mice, we can divide both sides of the equation by 104:

x = 7592 Ã· 104
x = 73

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of apples in the basket before the addition is x. 
After adding 166 apples, the total number of apples is x + 166. 
We know that the total number of apples is 168. 
So, we can set up the equation: x + 166 = 168. 
Subtracting 166 from both sides gives us: x = 168 - 166. 
x = 2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's analyze the situation: the dragon currently has 380 gold coins, and we want to find out how many he just added to his treasure pile. To do this, we need to subtract the number of coins he had previously collected from the current total.

Let's set up an equation:

Current total = Previous total + Newly added coins
380 = 333 + Newly added coins

To find the number of newly added coins, we can subtract 333 from both sides of the equation:

Newly added coins = 380 - 333
Newly added coins = 47

So, we can set up the equation: x + 55 = 373. 
To find the value of x, we can subtract 55 from both sides of the equation: x = 373 - 55.

We know that after adding 219 apples, the total count became 348. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 219 = 348

To solve for x, we can subtract 219 from both sides of the equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The watch is showing a time that's 399 minutes later than it actually is, which means the watch is fast by 399 minutes.
2. However, we know that the watch is fast by 262 minutes. This means that the initial setting of the watch was ahead by some amount, and then it gained an additional 399 - 262 = 137 minutes.

So, the watch was initially set 262 - 137 = 125 minutes ahead.

We know that the total number of books she has now is 344, and 67 of those were already hers. 
So, we can set up the equation: 67 + x = 344. 
To solve for x, we can subtract 67 from both sides of the equation: x = 344 - 67 = 277.

To do this, we can divide the total kWh generated (8640) by the wind speed (45 kph). This will give us the kWh generated per kph of wind speed.

8640 kWh Ã· 45 kph = 192 kWh/kph

Since the average amount of milk produced per day is 120 pounds, the total amount of milk produced is 120x pounds.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say Princess Serena already had x gold charms in her collection.

Since she gained 310 silver charms over the last year, the total number of charms she has now is the sum of the gold charms she already had and the silver charms she gained: x + 310.

We know that the total number of charms she has now is 644. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 310 = 644

To solve for x, we can subtract 310 from both sides of the equation:

x = 644 - 310
x = 334

So, Princess Serena already had 334 gold charms in her collection.

            A chocolate factory has a daily production of 385 chocolate bars. If 230 bars are dark chocolate, how many bars are milk chocolate?

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's use subtraction to find the number of milk chocolate bars. We know that the total number of chocolate bars produced daily is 385, and 230 of them are dark chocolate. To find the number of milk chocolate bars, we subtract the number of dark chocolate bars from the total number of bars.

385 (total bars) - 230 (dark chocolate bars) = 155

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the increase in altitude, we need to subtract the initial altitude from the new altitude.
Increase in altitude = New altitude - Initial altitude
= 357 - 289

            If a zoo needs 4572 pounds of food to feed every monkey over a month and every single monkey eats 36 pounds of food in a month, how many monkeys are there in the zoo?

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say there are x monkeys in the zoo. Since each monkey eats 36 pounds of food in a month, the total amount of food needed is 36x pounds. We know that the zoo needs 4572 pounds of food, so we can set up the equation:

36x = 4572

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 36:

x = 4572 Ã· 36
x = 127

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of rooms in the doll house is x. Since each room can hold 16 dolls, the total number of dolls the doll house can hold is 16x. We know that the doll house can hold a total of 832 dolls, so we can set up the equation:

16x = 832

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 16:

x = 832 Ã· 16
x = 52

So, there are 52 rooms in the doll house.
