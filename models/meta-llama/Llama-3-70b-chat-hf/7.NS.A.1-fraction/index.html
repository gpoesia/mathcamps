            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum, we need to convert both fractions to have a common denominator, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 48 and 47. Since 48 and 47 are coprime (they have no common factors), their LCM is their product, 48 Ã— 47 = 2256.

Now, we can convert both fractions:

60/48 = (60 Ã— 47) / (48 Ã— 47) = 2820 / 2256
37/47 = (37 Ã— 48) / (47 Ã— 48) = 1776 / 2256

Now we can add the fractions:

(2820 + 1776) / 2256 = 4596 / 2256

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 112:

4596 Ã· 112 = 41
2256 Ã· 112 = 20

So, the sum is:

3. Add the two results: (7/12) + (157/36)

4584/2280 = (4584/76)/(2280/76) = 60.55

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 57 and 42 is 2394. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 2394:

92/42 = (92*57)/(42*57) = 5244/2394

Now we can add the two fractions:

588/2394 + 5244/2394 = (588 + 5244)/2394 = 5832/2394

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 6:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's calculate the sum of 14/57 and 92/42:

14/57 = (14*42)/(57*42) = 588/2394
92/42 = (92*57)/(42*57) = 5244/2394

Now we can add the two fractions:

588/2394 + 5244/2394 = (588 + 5244)/2394 = 5832/2394

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 6:

5832/2394 = (5832 Ã· 6)/(2394 Ã· 6) = 972/399

Now, let's subtract 38/65 from the result:

972/399 - 38/65 = ?

To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 399 and 65 is 25935. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 25935:

972/399 = (972*65)/(399*65) = 63380/25935
38/65 = (38*399)/(65*399) = 15162/25935

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

63380/25935 - 15162/25935 = (63380 - 15162)/25935 = 48218/25935

Now we can add the two fractions:

588/2394 + 1816/2394 = (588 + 1816)/2394 = 2404/2394

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 7 by 69: 7 / 69 = 1/9
2. Divide 71 by 47: 71 / 47 = 1 + 24/47
3. Add the results: 1/9 + 1 + 24/47

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 423. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

1/9 = 47/423
1 = 423/423
24/47 = 216/423

87/26 = (87*480)/(26*480) = 4180/12480
2305/480 = (2305*26)/(480*26) = 59930/12480

1. Divide 94 by 35: 94 Ã· 35 = 2 24/35
2. Divide 23 by 49: 23 Ã· 49 = 23/49
3. Subtract the two results: 2 24/35 - 23/49

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 245. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

2 96/245 - 23/49 = 2 96/245 - 117/245

Now, we can subtract:

2 96/245 - 117/245 = 2 -21/245

49/37 = (49 Ã— 30) / (37 Ã— 30) = 1470/1110

Now we can add the two fractions:

2156/1110 + 1470/1110 = (2156 + 1470) / 1110 = 3626/1110

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum, we need to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 79 and 6 is 474. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 474:

30/79 = (30*6)/(79*6) = 180/474
29/6 = (29*79)/(6*79) = 2301/474

Now we can add:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract 11/66 from 59/2, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 66 is 66. So, we can convert 59/2 to 59*33/2*33 = 1947/66.

Now, we can subtract: 1947/66 - 11/66 = (1947 - 11)/66 = 1936/66.

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. So, 1936/66 = 968/33.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's find the result of subtracting 11/66 from 59/2:

59/2 = 59*33/2*33 = 1947/66
1947/66 - 11/66 = (1947 - 11)/66 = 1936/66
1936/66 = 968/33 (simplified)

Now, let's add 63/51 and 968/33:

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 51 and 33 is 1683. So, we can convert 63/51 to 63*33/51*33 = 2079/1683 and 968/33 to 968*51/33*51 = 49488/1683.

Now, we can add: 2079/1683 + 49488/1683 = (2079 + 49488)/1683 = 51567/1683.

Now, we can convert 11/31 to 11*2/31*2 = 22/62.

25/26 = (25*23)/(26*23) = 575/598

Now we can add the fractions:

Now we can add the fractions:

1170/598 + 575/598 = (1170 + 575)/598 = 1745/598

Comparing this result to the original calculation, we can see that the sum is smaller:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, I'll add the two fractions with the same denominator:

43/4 + 71/4 = (43 + 71)/4 = 114/4

To simplify, I'll divide the numerator by the denominator:

114 Ã· 4 = 28.5

Now, I'll add 92/79 to 28.5. To do this, I'll convert 28.5 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 79:

28.5 = (28.5 Ã— 79) / 79 = 2251.5 / 79

Now, I can add the two fractions:

2251.5/79 + 92/79 = (2251.5 + 92) / 79 = 2343.5 / 79

86/82 = (86*129)/(82*129) = 11114/10578

Now we can add the two fractions:
213328/10578 + 11114/10578 = 224442/10578

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:
224442 Ã· 2 = 112221
10578 Ã· 2 = 5289

So, the result is:
112221/5289

        <pre class="model-raw-response">I think there's a misunderstanding! The original problem was about adding fractions, not sharing a pie. But I'll assume you meant to ask about adding fractions again.

We already calculated the sum of 16/86 and 60/3 in the previous problem. However, now you're asking about adding 75/86 and 60/3.

Let's convert both fractions to have the same denominator, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 86 and 3. The LCM of 86 and 3 is 258.

First, let's convert 75/86:
75/86 = (75*3)/(86*3) = 225/258

Next, let's convert 60/3:
60/3 = (60*86)/(3*86) = 5160/258

Now we can add the two fractions:
225/258 + 5160/258 = 5385/258

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:
5385 Ã· 3 = 1795
258 Ã· 3 = 86

So, the sum is:
1795/86

Now, we can add the fractions:

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8:

So, the sum of the fractions is 10/2, which is equal to 5.

To add 32/64 to this sum, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 (the denominator of 5) and 64 is 64. So, we can convert 5 to 320/64.

Now, we can add the fractions:
320/64 + 32/64 = 352/64

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8:
352 Ã· 8 = 44

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 75 and 58 is 870. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 870:

49/75 = (49*12)/(75*12) = 588/870
88/58 = (88*15)/(58*15) = 1320/870

Now we can add:

588/870 + 1320/870 = (588 + 1320)/870 = 1908/870

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

1908/870 = (1908/2)/(870/2) = 954/435

Now, we need to subtract 24/64 from it. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 40 and 64. The least common multiple (LCM) of 40 and 64 is 160. So, we can convert 113/40 to 452/160 and 24/64 to 60/160.

Now, we can subtract:

452/160 - 60/160 = 392/160

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 8:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum, we need to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 76 and 33 is 2508. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 2508:

64/76 = (64*33)/(76*33) = 2112/2508
35/33 = (35*76)/(33*76) = 2660/2508

Now we can add the two fractions:

2112/2508 + 2660/2508 = (2112 + 2660)/2508 = 4772/2508

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

4772/2508 = (4772/4)/(2508/4) = 1193/627

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 627 and 38 is 23946. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 23946:

1193/627 = (1193*38)/(627*38) = 45334/23946
47/38 = (47*627)/(38*627) = 2939/23946

Now we can add the two fractions:

45334/23946 + 2939/23946 = (45334 + 2939)/23946 = 48273/23946

Now we can add the two fractions:

1419/2508 + 2660/2508 = (1419 + 2660)/2508 = 4079/2508

Now, let's subtract 92/89 from the result:

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3510 and 89 is 313590. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

7764/3510 = (7764*89)/(3510*89) = 692676/313590
92/89 = (92*3510)/(89*3510) = 32320/313590

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 98 and 82 is 4018. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 4018:

80/98 = (80*41)/(98*41) = 3280/4018
92/82 = (92*49)/(82*49) = 4508/4018

Now we can add the two fractions:

(3280/4018) + (4508/4018) = (3280 + 4508)/4018 = 7788/4018

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:

7788/4018 = (7788/2)/(4018/2) = 3894/2009

69/5 = (69 Ã— 44) / (5 Ã— 44) = 3026 / 220

Now we can add the two fractions:

            If Wooden Treasures, a furniture workshop, cuts a log into pieces. Each piece is 45/2 feet long. If they sell a piece of wood that is 18/90 feet shorter than the usual length, how long is the piece they sold?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the length of each usual piece of wood. Since each piece is 45/2 feet long, we can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5. So, 45/2 = 9 feet.

Now, the piece they sold is 18/90 feet shorter than the usual length. We can simplify 18/90 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 18. So, 18/90 = 1/5 feet.

To find the length of the piece they sold, we subtract 1/5 feet from the usual length of 9 feet. To do this, we need to convert 9 feet to a fraction with a denominator of 5, which is 45/5. Now, we can subtract: 45/5 - 1/5 = 44/5 feet.

Finally, we can convert 44/5 feet back to a mixed number: 44/5 = 8 4/5 feet.

99/92 = (99*73)/(92*73) = 7267/6676
15/74 = (15*92)/(74*92) = 1380/6676

Now we can add the two fractions:
