        Think back to that original number we started with - 3. What if instead of subtracting 2, you subtract just 1 from it. Then, proceed the same way as before - take the result and add it to itself. What is the final number now?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's work through the problem again.

First, take the whole number 3 and subtract 1 from it:
3 - 1 = 2

Next, take the result (2) and add it to itself:
2 + 2 = 4

        A compass starts pointing north, makes a full spin with 3 complete rotations, and then is spun back by 1 rotation in the same direction. How many total spins from its original position is the compass pointing at now?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Samantha already has 1 sleeping bag. She decides to buy an equal number, which means she will buy 1 more sleeping bag. 
To find the total number of sleeping bags Samantha has after her purchase, we add the number of sleeping bags she already has to the number of sleeping bags she bought: 1 + 1 = 2.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: There were 3 birds initially, and 1 bird flew away, leaving 3 - 1 = 2 birds.
The same number of squirrels as the remaining birds (2) come and join them.
So, there are 2 birds and 2 squirrels, making a total of 2 + 2 = 4 animals in the forest now.

        After the squirrels joined the birds in the forest, a rabbit hopped in too. Now, how many animals are there in total in the forest?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: There were 4 animals in the forest (2 birds and 2 squirrels) before the rabbit hopped in.
Now, with the addition of 1 rabbit, the total number of animals becomes 4 + 1 = 5.
