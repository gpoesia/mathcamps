            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the company produced the same number of tubes for 3 consecutive days, we can multiply the number of tubes produced in one day by 3 to find the total number of tubes produced.

Let's call the number of tubes produced in one day &quot;x&quot;. Then, we can set up the equation:

x + x + x = 2917

Combine like terms:

3x = 2917

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 2917/3
x = 972.33 (but we can't produce a fraction of a tube, so we'll round down to 972)

Now, multiply the number of tubes produced in one day by 3:

972 Ã— 3 = 2916

            A telescope magnifies an object 67 times and each magnification adds 86 units to the object's size. What is the total size of the object with added magnification?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the telescope magnifies the object 67 times, and each magnification adds 86 units, we need to multiply the number of magnifications by the units added per magnification.

Total size added = Number of magnifications Ã— Units added per magnification
= 67 Ã— 86
= 5762

Since the problem asks for the total size of the object with added magnification, we need to know the original size of the object. However, the problem doesn't provide that information. Let's assume the original size of the object is x.

Total size of the object with added magnification = Original size + Total size added
= x + 5762

Without knowing the original size, we can't provide a specific total size. However, we can express the total size in terms of the original size.

The original size of the object is 58 units. To find the total size of the object with added magnification, we add the original size to the total size added.

            Suppose the helicopter builder now needs 7661 parts for each helicopter, instead of 3224 as originally planned. If they still plan to build 4 helicopters, how many parts will they need in total now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total number of parts needed, we can multiply the new number of parts needed per helicopter by the number of helicopters they plan to build.

Number of parts per helicopter = 7661
Number of helicopters = 4

Total number of parts needed = Number of parts per helicopter Ã— Number of helicopters
= 7661 Ã— 4
