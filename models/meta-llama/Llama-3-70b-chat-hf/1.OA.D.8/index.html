            After a birthday party, you see one piece of cake left. If you originally had a whole cake that was cut into h slices, and each slice was equal in size, then how many slices were there in the whole cake, given that 12 pieces have been eaten during the party?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the whole cake was cut into h slices. Since each slice is equal in size, the total number of slices is h.

During the party, 12 pieces were eaten, leaving 1 piece remaining. This means that the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten is equal to the number of slices remaining:

h - 12 = 1

To find the total number of slices, we can add 12 to both sides of the equation:

h = 1 + 12
h = 13

x = 5

If he gives 19 bones to his friend, he would be left with 1 bone. This means that the number of bones he had initially minus the number of bones he gave away is equal to 1.

We can set up an equation: o - 19 = 1

To solve for 'o', we can add 19 to both sides of the equation: o - 19 + 19 = 1 + 19

This simplifies to: o = 20

So, Oliver originally had 20 bones in his backyard.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The camper initially had 4 sleeping bags. After their friends dropped off their bags, there were 11 sleeping bags in total. To find out how many sleeping bags the friends brought, we need to subtract the number of sleeping bags the camper had from the total number of sleeping bags.

Let's set up an equation: Total sleeping bags = Camper's sleeping bags + Friends' sleeping bags
11 = 4 + Friends' sleeping bags

Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:
11 - 4 = Friends' sleeping bags
7 = Friends' sleeping bags

To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 20 - 7 = 13.

But we know that's not the starting point, because they climbed down further to reach the 10-foot point. So, we need to add the remaining distance they climbed down to find the starting height.

The remaining distance is the difference between the 10-foot point and the starting point. Since they climbed down 4 feet to reach the 10-foot point, the remaining distance is also 4 feet.

Adding this to the 14-foot point, we get: 14 + 4 = 18 feet.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of new apple trees the farmer planted is x. 
We know that the total number of apple trees after planting is 18, which is the sum of the original 9 trees and the new trees. 
So, we can set up the equation: 9 + x = 18. 
To solve for x, we can subtract 9 from both sides of the equation: x = 18 - 9 = 9.

After giving away 4 skateboards, he had 8 skateboards left, so we can set up the equation:

x = 8 + 4
x = 12

We know that the total number of oranges he had after collecting from his garden is 16, and he already had 14 oranges in his basket. So, we can set up the equation:

14 + x = 16

To find the value of x, we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:

x = 16 - 14
x = 2

So, the fruit seller collected 2 oranges from his garden.

The amount of cheese produced in the morning is 9 pounds.
So, the amount of cheese produced by the end of the day minus the amount produced in the morning is 16 - 9 = 7 pounds.

We know that the total number of binoculars in the late afternoon is 11, which is the sum of the initial 7 binoculars and the additional x binoculars made in the afternoon. 
So, we can set up the equation: 7 + x = 11. 
To find the value of x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: x = 11 - 7 = 4.

After selling 13, the number of dresses left is x - 13.

We know that there were only 2 dresses left in stock, so we can set up the equation:

x - 13 = 2

To solve for x, we can add 13 to both sides of the equation:

x = 2 + 13
x = 15

So, the fashion designer started with 15 blue dresses.

We know that by noon, he sold 6 hats, so he had x - 6 hats left.

We are also told that he was left with 9 hats, so we can set up the equation:

Since I started with 12 dollars and ended up with 16 dollars, that means the amount I spent during the trip is 12 - x, and the amount I received as change is x. Since I ended up with 16 dollars, we can set up the equation: 12 - (amount spent) + (amount received as change) = 16. Substituting the values, we get: 12 - (12 - x) + x = 16.

We know that the young giraffe is 1 meter shorter than a full-grown giraffe, and it is 3 meters tall. So, we can set up the equation:

To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the student added x pencils to the box. 
Initially, there were 10 pencils. 
After adding x pencils, the total became 14. 
So, we can set up the equation: 10 + x = 14. 
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: x = 14 - 10 = 4.

            A pillow factory has a stock of 14 feather pillows. After a small order is shipped, they have 4 feather pillows left. How many feather pillows were in the shipped order?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of feather pillows in the shipped order is x. Since the factory had 14 feather pillows initially and 4 were left after the order was shipped, we can set up the equation:

14 - x = 4

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

14 = x + 4

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:

10 = x

So, the number of feather pillows in the shipped order is 10.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of additional pepperoni pizzas baked throughout the day is x. 
We know that the total number of pepperoni pizzas at the end of the day is 15 (initial pizzas) + x (additional pizzas) = 16. 
To find the value of x, we can set up the equation: 15 + x = 16. 
Subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation, we get: x = 16 - 15 = 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The band had prepared 11 songs, but they only performed 7 songs. To find out how many songs they were not able to perform, we need to subtract the number of songs they performed from the total number of songs they had prepared.

11 (total songs) - 7 (performed songs) = 4

            A snowman has a certain number of snowballs stacked to form its shape. If 7 snowballs are removed, only 11 snowballs remain. How many snowballs were used to build the snowman originally?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the original number of snowballs used to build the snowman is x.

After removing 7 snowballs, 11 snowballs remain, so we can set up the equation:

x - 7 = 11

To solve for x, we can add 7 to both sides of the equation:

x = 11 + 7
x = 18
