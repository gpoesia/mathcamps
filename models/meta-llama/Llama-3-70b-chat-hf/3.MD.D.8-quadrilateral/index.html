        The perimeter of a rectangular swimming pool is 324 meters. The length of the pool is 83 meters. What is the width of the pool?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. We are given that the perimeter P is 324 meters and the length l is 83 meters. We can plug these values into the formula to get:

324 = 2(83) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

324 = 166 + 2w

Subtracting 166 from both sides, we get:

158 = 2w

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

79 = w

        A rectangle has a perimeter of 194 cm. The length of one of its sides is 49 cm. Can you determine the length of its other side?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Since the perimeter of the rectangle is 194 cm, we can set up an equation using the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

194 = 2(L + W)

Now, we are given that one of the sides (let's call it the length) is 49 cm. We can plug this value into the equation:

194 = 2(49 + W)

Simplify the equation:

194 = 98 + 2W

Subtract 98 from both sides:

96 = 2W

Divide both sides by 2:

48 = W

So, the length of the other side (the width) is 48 cm.

        A rectangle has a perimeter of 204m. If one of its sides has a length of 16m, what is the length of the other side?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Since the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides, we can set up an equation:

2(l + w) = 204

where l is the length and w is the width.

We are given that one of the sides has a length of 16m, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

2(16 + w) = 204

Now, let's simplify the equation:

32 + 2w = 204

Subtract 32 from both sides:

2w = 172

Divide both sides by 2:

w = 86

So, the length of the other side is 86m.

Since the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides, we can set up an equation:

where l is the length and w is the width.

We are given that one side (let's call it the width) is 43 meters, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

2(l + 43) = 236

Now, let's simplify the equation:

2l + 86 = 236

Subtract 86 from both sides:

2l = 150

Divide both sides by 2:

l = 75

So, the length of the opposite side is 75 meters.

Since the perimeter of the rectangle is 384cm, we can set up an equation using the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

384 = 2(L + 99)

Now, divide both sides by 2:

192 = L + 99

Subtract 99 from both sides:

93 = L

Since the longer sides of the rectangle are equal, the length of each longer side is 93cm.

255 = 78 + 15 + 63 + Side4

Now, let's simplify the equation by combining the lengths of the first three sides:

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Since it's a rectangle, it has two pairs of equal sides. Let's call the length of the other side &quot;x&quot;.

The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides, which is given as 254m. We can set up an equation using this information:

2(l + w) = 254

where l is the length (which is the side we're trying to find) and w is the width (which is given as 89m).

Substituting w = 89, we get:

2(l + 89) = 254

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2l + 178 = 254

Subtracting 178 from both sides, we get:

2l = 76

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

l = 38

        A quadrilateral has a total perimeter of 196 meters. The lengths of three of its sides combined is 183 meters (with one side being 92 meters and the other two sides being 29 and 62 meters respectively). Can you figure out the length of the fourth side?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step!

We know the total perimeter of the quadrilateral is 196 meters.

We also know the lengths of three of its sides:

* One side is 92 meters
* Another side is 29 meters
* The third side is 62 meters

Let's add up the lengths of these three sides:

92 + 29 + 62 = 183 meters

Now, we can set up an equation to find the length of the fourth side:

Total Perimeter = Sum of lengths of three sides + Length of fourth side
196 = 183 + x

Subtract 183 from both sides of the equation:

196 - 183 = x
13 = x

So, the length of the fourth side is 13 meters.

We are given the length, which is 90 cm. So, we can plug that in: 2(90 + w) = 198.

To solve for w, we can start by dividing both sides by 2: 90 + w = 99.

Then, we can subtract 90 from both sides: w = 9.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Since the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides, we can set up an equation:

2(l + w) = 158

where l is the length of the longer side and w is the length of the shorter side.

We know that each of the shorter sides is 51 meters long, so we can substitute w = 51 into the equation:

2(l + 51) = 158

Now, let's simplify the equation:

2l + 102 = 158

Subtract 102 from both sides:

2l = 56

Divide both sides by 2:

l = 28

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Since the playground is rectangular, it has four sides. Two opposite sides have a length of 19m each, so the total length of these two sides is 19 + 19 = 38m.

The total length of the fence is 166m, so the total length of the other two sides is 166 - 38 = 128m.

Since these two sides are opposite each other, they must have the same length. Therefore, the length of each of the other two sides is 128 รท 2 = 64m.

        A quadrilateral has a perimeter of 246m. You know that two of its sides are 40m and 32m long, another side is 95m long. What is the length of the fourth side?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's start by using the fact that the perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of all its sides. We can set up an equation:

Perimeter = Side1 + Side2 + Side3 + Side4

We know the perimeter is 246m, and three of the sides are 40m, 32m, and 95m. Let's plug these values into the equation:

246 = 40 + 32 + 95 + Side4

Now, let's simplify the equation by combining the known sides:

246 = 167 + Side4

Subtract 167 from both sides to isolate Side4:

246 - 167 = Side4
79 = Side4

        A rectangle has a perimeter of 98m. If one of its sides is 5m long, what is the length of the other side?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step!

Since the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides, we can set up an equation:

2(l + w) = 98

where l is the length and w is the width.

We are given that one of the sides is 5m long, so let's say the width w = 5m.

Now, substitute w into the equation:

2(l + 5) = 98

Simplify the equation:

2l + 10 = 98

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2l = 88

Divide both sides by 2:

l = 44

So, the length of the other side is 44m.

        A rectangle has two sides measuring 45m each. If the total perimeter of the rectangle is 210m, what is the length of each of the other two sides?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's call the length of each of the other two sides &quot;x&quot;.

Since the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides, we can set up the equation:

2(45) + 2x = 210

Simplifying the equation, we get:

90 + 2x = 210

Subtracting 90 from both sides, we get:

2x = 120

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 60

So, the length of each of the other two sides is 60m.
