        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: There are 82 bubbles initially. 20 bubbles pop, so we need to subtract 20 from 82 to find the number of bubbles that remain un-popped.
82 - 20 = 62
Later, 19 more bubbles are blown, so we add 19 to the remaining bubbles.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Before his break, Timmy went on the slide 74 times. After his break, he went on the slide 51 times. To find out how many times less he went on the slide after his break, we need to subtract the number of times he went after his break from the number of times he went before his break.

74 (before break) - 51 (after break) = 23

So, Timmy went on the slide 23 times less after his break compared to before.

        In the scenario where the moon's orbit is known to be approximately 99 days long and there were 87 days of complete visibility from Earth instead of 76, how many days would the moon not be visible from Earth in that case?

        At the pizza party, a total of 100 pizzas were prepared by the chef. After the first round of orders, 25 people order a Margherita pizza and another 29 people order a Pepperoni pizza. How many pizzas are still left unclaimed?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that 25 people ordered a Margherita pizza and 29 people ordered a Pepperoni pizza. To find the total number of pizzas claimed, we add these two numbers together.
Total number of pizzas claimed = 25 + 29 = 54
The chef prepared a total of 100 pizzas. To find the number of pizzas still left unclaimed, we subtract the number of pizzas claimed from the total number of pizzas prepared.
Number of pizzas still left unclaimed = 100 - 54 = 46

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's call the missing number &quot;x&quot;. We know that the difference between the larger number (88) and the missing number (x) is 78. We can set up an equation to represent this:

88 - x = 78

To solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation:

88 = 78 + x

Subtracting 78 from both sides gives us:

10 = x

30 - 24 = 6

Wait, that's not right! Ben can't have 6 notes left if his sister took away 24 notes, because 30 - 24 = -6, and you can't have a negative number of notes. This means Ben doesn't have enough notes for his sister to take away 24. 

In this scenario, Ben would have 0 notes left, because his sister took away all his notes and then some!

        Apple Inc. has 100 new smartphones in their main store. They sold 78 of them on the first day. If they received an additional shipment of 41 new smartphones the next day, how many new smartphones does the store have now?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Apple Inc. had 100 new smartphones initially and sold 78, so they had 100 - 78 = 22 smartphones left.
They received an additional shipment of 41 new smartphones, so they now have 22 + 41 = 63 smartphones.
