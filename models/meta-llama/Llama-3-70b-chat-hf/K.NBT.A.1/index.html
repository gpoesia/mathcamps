            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say Sarah's friend gave her x candies. Since Sarah had 4 candies initially and ended up with 10 candies, we can set up the equation: 4 + x = 10.

To solve for x, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: x = 10 - 4 = 6.

So, Sarah's friend gave her 6 candies.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We are not given the exact number of science fiction novels, but we know that there are 10 books in total, and 4 of them are fantasy novels. To find the number of science fiction novels, we can subtract the number of fantasy novels from the total number of books.

Let's assume the number of science fiction novels is x. Then, we can set up the equation:

x + 4 = 10

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10 - 4
x = 6

So, there are 6 science fiction novels.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The robot needs 10 units of energy to start and run for 1 hour.
2. To keep running for another hour, it needs additional 'w' units of energy.
3. The total energy required for the robot to run for 2 hours is 13 units.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

10 (initial energy) + w (additional energy) = 13 (total energy for 2 hours)

Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to isolate w:

w = 13 - 10
w = 3

So, the robot needs 3 extra units of energy to run for the additional hour.

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since there are 19 pairs of ice skates in total, and 10 of them are black, we can find the number of white pairs by subtracting the number of black pairs from the total number of pairs.

Let's set up an equation: Total pairs = Black pairs + White pairs
19 = 10 + White pairs

To find the number of white pairs, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

White pairs = 19 - 10
White pairs = 9

To find the number of roses Tim received, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

After receiving 7 more letters, he now has a total of 10 letters. We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 7 = 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 7
x = 3

So, James had 3 letters in his mailbox originally.

10 (initial marshmallows) - 3 (marshmallows left) = 7

            John has a guitar with 10 strings. Some of the strings broke, but you know that being left with (e + 6) strings meant the guitar still had 10 strings. What is the value of e, i.e., how many strings were broken?

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's analyze the situation: John has a guitar with 10 strings initially. Some strings broke, and he was left with (e + 6) strings. This means that the number of strings broken is equal to the initial number of strings minus the number of strings left.

We can set up an equation:

10 - (number of strings broken) = e + 6

Since the guitar still has 10 strings, it means that no strings were broken. Therefore, the number of strings broken is 0.

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

10 - 0 = e + 6
10 = e + 6

Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us:

4 = e

We know that the number of dolphins increased by 1, so the new total number of dolphins is x + 1.

We are also told that the new total number of dolphins is 10, so we can set up the equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's assume the distance from the house to the park is x miles, which is given as 10 miles. The total distance from the house to the movie theater is the sum of the distance from the house to the park and the distance from the park to the movie theater. 

Let the distance from the park to the movie theater be y miles. Then, we can set up the equation: 
x + y = 17 

We know x = 10, so we can substitute this value into the equation: 
10 + y = 17 

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us: 
y = 7 

So, the distance from the park to the movie theater is 7 miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the amount of milk the farmer collected this time is x liters. Since he already had 10 liters and ended up with 12 liters, we can set up the equation: 10 + x = 12.

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: x = 12 - 10 = 2.

x = 5

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The dragon initially had 10 gold coins. The brave knight took 8 coins, so we need to subtract 8 from 10 to find out how many coins the dragon has left.

10 - 8 = 2

            A dolphin trainer currently has 9 dolphins and later acquires some additional ones, making the total number of dolphins in his care 10. How many dolphins did the trainer acquire?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the number of dolphins the trainer acquired is x.

We know that the total number of dolphins after acquiring the additional ones is 10, and the trainer already had 9 dolphins. So, we can set up the equation:

9 + x = 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 9
x = 1

            A butterfly starts her day with 6 flowers and visits r more in the afternoon to get her total daily quota of 10 flowers. How many more flowers does she need to visit in the afternoon?

            <span class="response-field">Llama 3 70B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's analyze the situation: the butterfly starts with 6 flowers and needs to reach a total of 10 flowers. To find out how many more flowers she needs to visit, we can subtract the number of flowers she already has from her daily quota.

Let r be the number of flowers she needs to visit in the afternoon. We can set up the equation:

6 + r = 10

Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation to solve for r:

r = 10 - 6
r = 4
