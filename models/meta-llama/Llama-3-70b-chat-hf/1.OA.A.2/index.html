        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Samantha already has 5 tent poles for her own tent. She needs an equal number of tent poles for her friend's tent, which means she needs 5 more tent poles.
Total number of tent poles Samantha needs for both tents = 5 (for her own tent) + 5 (for her friend's tent) = 10
After realizing she needs another set of 5 poles for a small storage tent, Samantha needs an additional 5 tent poles.
Total number of tent poles Samantha needs in total = 10 (for both tents) + 5 (for the storage tent) = 15

The farmer starts with 1 apple tree.

He plants 3 more, so now he has 1 + 3 = 4 apple trees.

Then, he plants an equivalent number of trees to the initial number in the orchard, which is 1. So, he adds 4 (the new total) to the initial number 1, which means he plants 4 more trees.

Now, the total number of apple trees in the orchard is 4 + 4 = 8.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The distance from the ground to the window is 5 feet plus the firefighter's own height, which is 2 feet. So, the distance from the ground to the window is 5 + 2 = 7 feet.
2. There are an additional 11 feet between the window and the people he needs to rescue. To find the total distance, we add the distance from the ground to the window (7 feet) to the additional distance (11 feet).

Total distance = 7 + 11 = 18 feet

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's recalculate the total distance using the corrected information:

1. The distance from the ground to the window is still 5 feet plus the firefighter's own height, which is 2 feet. So, the distance from the ground to the window is 5 + 2 = 7 feet.
2. There are an additional 13 feet between the window and the people he needs to rescue. To find the total distance, we add the distance from the ground to the window (7 feet) to the additional distance (13 feet).

Total distance = 7 + 13 = 20 feet

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Liam finds 2 new species of butterflies and 3 new species of birds, so he finds a total of 2 + 3 = 5 species of birds and butterflies.

He then discovers as many new insect species as the total number of bird and butterfly species combined, which is 5. So, he finds 5 new insect species.

The total number of species Liam discovers so far is 5 (birds and butterflies) + 5 (insects) = 10.

The very next day, he encounters 4 more unique species.

The total number of species Liam discovers during his second day at the park is 10 + 4 = 14.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Timmy originally had 4 giraffes. He then gets the same amount of giraffes he already had, which is 4 more giraffes. So, he now has 4 + 4 = 8 giraffes. Then, he adds the amount of giraffes he originally had, which is 4 more giraffes. So, he now has 8 + 4 = 12 giraffes.

            In a different scenario, instead of originally having 4 giraffes, suppose Timmy originally had 5 giraffes. If he then gets the same amount of giraffes he already had, and then adds the amount of giraffes he originally had, how many giraffes does Timmy have now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Timmy originally had 5 giraffes. He then gets the same amount of giraffes he already had, which is 5 more giraffes. So, he now has 5 + 5 = 10 giraffes. Then, he adds the amount of giraffes he originally had, which is 5 more giraffes. So, he now has 10 + 5 = 15 giraffes.
