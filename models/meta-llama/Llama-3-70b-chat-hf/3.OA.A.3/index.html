        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that 60 magic dust particles are created in one day by all the fairies in a cluster.
Since each magic dust particle lasts for 1 whole week, the total number of magic dust particles available in a cluster of houses after a week is the number of particles created in one day multiplied by 7 (days in a week).
So, the total number of magic dust particles available in a cluster of houses after a week is 60 x 7 = 420.

We know that the total number of fireplaces is 96, so we can set up the equation 8x = 96. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8, which gives us x = 96/8 = 12.

Each round trip consumes 6 liters of fuel, so we can multiply the number of round trips by the fuel consumption per trip:

2 round trips Ã— 6 liters/round trip = 12 liters

So, John has used 12 liters of fuel to make all of his trips.

Initially, there are 3 magical fairies.

Each fairy has the ability to create triplets of herself, which means each fairy will create 3 additional copies of herself.

So, the first fairy will create 3 more fairies, making a total of 3 + 1 = 4 fairies.

The second fairy will also create 3 more fairies, making a total of 4 + 3 = 7 fairies.

The third fairy will create 3 more fairies, making a total of 7 + 3 = 10 fairies.

Therefore, after each of the 3 fairies uses their ability, there will be a total of 10 fairies in Fairyland.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many whole wheels of cheese Farmer Brown can make, we need to divide the total number of blocks he has (42) by the number of blocks required to make one wheel (7).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that there were 2 lemons in each box initially. Mr. Lemon wants to add 2 more lemons to each box, so we need to add 2 to the initial number of lemons in each box.

2 (initial lemons) + 2 (additional lemons) = 4

So, there will be 4 lemons in each box now.

Number of filters per camera Ã— Number of cameras = Total number of filters

Let's say the number of filters per camera is x. Then, the equation becomes:

x Ã— 5 = 10

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 10 Ã· 5
x = 2

However, the problem states that Jane initially gave 6 filters to each camera, not 2. This means that the initial distribution was not equal to the 10 filters she received as a gift.

However, we can see that 15 is not exactly divisible by 7. We can find the largest whole number of segments by dividing 15 by 7:

15 cm Ã· 7 cm = 2 with a remainder of 1

This means Maya would have obtained 2 full segments of 7 cm each, and a remaining piece of 1 cm. Since the remaining piece is not a full segment, we don't count it.
