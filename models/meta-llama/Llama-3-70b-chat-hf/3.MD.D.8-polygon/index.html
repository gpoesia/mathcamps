We know that the total perimeter of the dodecagon is 538cm. Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, we can set up an equation to represent the total perimeter:

Perimeter = 65 + 22 + 32 + 31 + 78 + 88 + 7 + 29 + 36 + 54 + x

where x is the length of the 11th side.

We can simplify the equation by adding up the given side lengths:

86 + 80 + 47 + 93 + 99 + x + x = 486

where x is the length of the sixth side.

Combine the known side lengths:

405 + x + x = 486

Combine like terms:

405 + 2x = 486

Subtract 405 from both sides:

2x = 81

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40.5

So, the length of the sixth side is 40.5m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: A nonagon is a polygon with 9 sides. Since it's a regular nonagon, all sides are equal. Let's call the length of each side &quot;s&quot;. The perimeter of the nonagon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides, which is 63m. Since there are 9 sides, we can set up the equation:

9s = 63

To find the length of each side, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

s = 63 Ã· 9

24m + 25m + 75m + 38m + 18m + 42m + 61m = 283m

Since the total perimeter of the decagon is 359m, we can set up an equation to find the length of one of the unknown sides:

283m + x + y = 359m

where x and y are the lengths of the two unknown sides.

Since the decagon has 10 sides, we know that x and y must be equal (because the decagon is symmetrical). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

283m + x + x = 359m

Combine like terms:

283m + 2x = 359m

Subtract 283m from both sides:

2x = 76m

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 38m

So, the length of one of the unknown sides is 38m.
