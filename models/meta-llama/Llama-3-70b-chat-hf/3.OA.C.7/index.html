            Superhero Green Gauntlet has the ability to multiply his strength by a factor of 3. If Jetstream, another superhero, has 5 times the strength of Green Gauntlet, what is the strength of Jetstream?

Let Green Gauntlet's original strength be x.

Since Green Gauntlet can multiply his strength by a factor of 3, his new strength is 3x.

Jetstream has 5 times the strength of Green Gauntlet, so Jetstream's strength is 5(3x) = 15x.

72 liters Ã· 10 days = 7.2 liters per day

Now, to calculate how much milk the cow will produce in 12 days, we can multiply the amount of milk produced per day by 12:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can set up a proportion to relate the miles to the inches. Let's say 1 inch represents x miles. Then, we can write:

30 miles = 10 inches
x miles = 1 inch

We can set up the proportion as:

30/x = 10/1

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

30 = 10x

Divide both sides by 10:

x = 30/10
x = 3

So, 1 inch represents 3 miles.

Let's assume the weight of the truck itself is not given, so we'll call it &quot;x&quot; tons. Then, the total weight being carried by the truck is the weight of the cargo (which is 64 tons) plus the weight of the truck itself:

Total weight = Weight of cargo + Weight of truck
= 64 + x

            In the previous situation, John multiplied the distance he traveled with 6. But this time, he decides to ride his scooter for a bit longer. Instead of multiplying by 6, he now multiplies the same initial half of 16, distance &quot;B&quot;, by 8 to find out the new total distance &quot;X&quot; he traveled back and forth.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The wizard staff can channel the spell for 6 equal periods of time before it needs a 1-minute break to recharge. This means the total time the staff can channel the spell is 60 - 1 = 59 minutes. Since there are 6 equal periods, we can divide 59 by 6 to find the length of each period: 59 Ã· 6 = 9.83 minutes. Since we can't have a fraction of a minute, we can round down to 9 minutes, as the staff can't channel the spell for a fraction of a minute.

Let's say John packs x pairs of pants. Then, he will need 2x pairs of socks. We know that he plans to bring 22 pairs of socks, so we can set up the equation:

            A penguin is diving into the sea. Initially, it took the penguin 28 seconds to reach a depth that is 4 times its own height. What is the square of the depth the penguin reaches in seconds?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step!

Let the height of the penguin be x.

The penguin reaches a depth that is 4 times its own height, so the depth is 4x.

The time it takes to reach this depth is 28 seconds.

We can set up a proportion to relate the depth and time:

depth / time = 4x / 28

Now, we want to find the square of the depth. To do this, we can square both sides of the equation:

(4x)^2 = (28)^2

Simplifying, we get:

16x^2 = 784
