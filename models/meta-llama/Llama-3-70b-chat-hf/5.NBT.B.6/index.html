2603 Ã· 10 = 260.3

Since we can't have a fraction of an egg, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, it's more reasonable to assume that the dinosaur lays a whole number of eggs in each nest. Therefore, we can divide 2603 by 10, which gives us:

2603 Ã· 10 = 260 with a remainder of 3

This means that 9 nests have 260 eggs each, and 1 nest has 259 eggs. But if we want a uniform distribution, we can say that each nest has 260 eggs.

However, we can't divide 3520 tulips into 3052 spaces evenly, since 3520 is greater than 3052. This means Anna won't be able to plant all 3520 tulips in the 3052 spaces.

Let's find out how many tulips she can plant in each space. We can do this by dividing 3052 (the number of spaces) into 3520 (the number of tulips). This will give us the maximum number of tulips she can plant in each space.

3520 Ã· 3052 = 1 with a remainder of 466

x = 8448 / 4759
x = 1.77 (approximately)

So, each centimeter on the map represents approximately 1.77 kilometers.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that each shelter received 57 gifts initially. Now, we need to divide the additional gifts (3697) by the number of shelters (13) to find out how many more gifts each shelter received.

3697 Ã· 13 = 284

So, each shelter received 284 more gifts. To find the total number of gifts each shelter received, we add the initial number of gifts to the additional gifts:
