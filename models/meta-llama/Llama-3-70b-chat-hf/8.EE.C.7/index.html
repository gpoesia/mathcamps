        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve for x, I'll start by isolating the term with the variable x.

77 = (33 + (14 * x))

First, I'll subtract 33 from both sides of the equation to get:

Next, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for x:

44/14 = x

x = 44/14

x = 3.14 (approximately)
