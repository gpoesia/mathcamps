        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 1 is 8. So, we can rewrite the second fraction as:

(4 / 1) = (4 Ã— 8 / 1 Ã— 8) = (32 / 8)

Now we can compare the two fractions:

(1 / 8) &lt; (32 / 8)

Since 1 is less than 32, the first fraction is less than the second fraction.

This comparison is different from the previous one because decreasing the numerator of the first fraction (from 3/2 to 3/7) makes it smaller compared to the second fraction (9/10). In the previous case, 3/2 was greater than 9/10, but now 3/7 is less than 9/10.</pre>

Since 9/9 is equal to 1, we can rewrite the statement as:

To compare these two fractions, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1 and 4 is 4. So, we can rewrite the first fraction with a denominator of 4:

(1) = (4 / 4)

Now we can compare the two fractions:

However, we can also notice that 24 is half of 48, and 42 is half of 84. Since 48 is less than 56, and 42 is less than 56, we can also compare the fractions by converting them to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 14:

(3 / 7) = (6 / 14)
(6 / 8) = (12 / 16) = (12*7 / 16*7) = (12*7 / 14*8) = (84 / 112) = (6 / 8) = (6*7 / 8*7) = (42 / 56) = (3 / 4) = (3*3.5 / 4*3.5) = (10.5 / 14)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1 and 9 is 9. So, we can rewrite the first fraction as:

(3/1) = (27/9)

Now we can compare the two fractions:

(27/9) ? (5/9)

Since 27 is greater than 5, we can conclude that:

(27/9) &gt; (5/9)

So, the correct answer is:

(3/1) &gt; (5/9)

            Question: 

In the previous question where we compared two fractions, we had (3 / 1) _ (5 / 9). Now, consider a change in the second number we are comparing. Instead of (5 / 9), we now have (5 / 5).

Compare these two fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's compare the two fractions:

(3/1) ? (5/5)

We can simplify the second fraction:

(5/5) = 1

So, we are comparing:

(3/1) ? 1

Since 3 is equal to 3, we can conclude that:

(3/1) = 1

So, the correct answer is:

(3/1) = (5/5)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 10 is 20. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 20:

(3 / 10) = (6 / 20)

Now that the denominators are the same, we can compare the numerators. Since 45 is greater than 6, we can conclude that:

(9 / 4) &gt; (3 / 10)

(9 / 3) _ (2 / 2)

Perform the same comparison operation as in the previous problem. Recall in the previous problem we compared the fractions (9 / 9) and (2 / 2). Consider what happens if we change the denominator of the first fraction from 9 to 3. Would this make the first fraction greater than, less than, or equal to the second fraction (2 / 2)?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the relationship between the two fractions, we need to compare their values.

The fraction (6 / 1) is equal to 6, since dividing 6 by 1 doesn't change its value.

The fraction (4 / 3) is equal to 1.33 (approximately), since 4 divided by 3 is 1.33.

Now, we can compare the two values: 6 and 1.33.

Since 6 is greater than 1.33, we can fill the blank with &gt;.

### Answer: &gt;

Comparing this result to the previous one, we can see that the relationship between the fractions is still &quot;greater than&quot; (&gt;), but the value of the second fraction has changed. In the previous scenario, the second fraction was equal to 1, and in this scenario, it's equal to 1.33. However, in both cases, the first fraction (6 / 1) is greater than the second fraction.</pre>

(3 / 9) = 1/3 (since 3 and 9 have a common factor of 3)

(8 / 3) = 8/3 (no simplification needed)

Now, we can compare the values:

1/3 &lt; 8/3 (since 8/3 is greater than 1/3)

Comparing this to the previous question, we can see that changing the denominator in the second fraction from 8 to 3 changes the relation between the two fractions. In the previous question, (3/9) was less than (8/8) because 1 is greater than 1/3. In this question, (3/9) is less than (8/3) because 8/3 is greater than 1/3.

Reassigning the values while maintaining the idea of comparison, frame the above expression into a question. Does the change in denominator affect the outcome as compared to the previous question, (6 / 6) _ (6 / 3)?

(6 / 3) = 2

Now, we can compare the values:

### Answer: &lt;

As for the effect of the change in denominator, we can see that it does affect the outcome. In the original question, (6 / 6) = 1, which is less than (6 / 3) = 2. In this variation, (6 / 4) = 1.5, which is still less than (6 / 3) = 2, but the difference is smaller. The change in denominator from 6 to 4 increases the value of the first fraction, making it closer to the second fraction, but it still doesn't change the fact that the second fraction is larger.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the values of these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 9 is 90. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 90:

(5/10) = (45/90)
(6/9) = (60/90)

Now we can compare the numerators:

45 &lt; 60

So, the correct equation is:

(5/10) &lt; (6/9)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

(2 / 4) = (2 / 4)

Now we can compare the fractions:

(2 / 4) &lt; (18 / 4)

So, the correct comparison is:

(2 / 4) &lt; (9 / 2)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare these fractions, we can convert them to equivalent fractions with the same denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 9 is 36. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 36:

(3 / 4) = (27 / 36)
(6 / 9) = (24 / 36)

Now we can compare the fractions:

27 &gt; 24

So, (3 / 4) is greater than (6 / 9).

If the second fraction changes and 6 is divided by 9 instead of 5, the value of the fraction decreases. This is because 9 is greater than 5, so dividing 6 by 9 results in a smaller value than dividing 6 by 5. As a result, the comparison between the two fractions changes, and (3 / 4) becomes greater than the modified fraction (6 / 9).

Fill in the blank

Let's compare the two fractions:

(1 / 5) and (2 / 1)

To compare, we can convert the second fraction to have a denominator of 5, like this:

(1 / 5) and (10 / 5)

Now, it's clear that:

(1 / 5) &lt; (10 / 5)

because 1 is less than 10.

In the context of the sweets, one fifth of your initially available sweets is less than two whole sweets someone offered you.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the same vein as the previous problem, consider a new comparison: 
(5 / 8) _ (6 / 5).

Which symbol: &lt;, &gt;, or =, correctly complete the comparison? Keep in mind how your answer might change compared to the previous problem because of the different denominator in the second fraction.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the correct symbol, we need to compare the two fractions.

First, let's find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple of 8 and 5 is 40. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 40:

(5/8) = (25/40)
(6/5) = (48/40)

Now, we can compare the two fractions:

25/40 &lt; 48/40

Since 25 is less than 48, the correct symbol is &lt;.

(5/10) and (6/1)

To compare these fractions, we can convert the second fraction to have a denominator of 10:

(5/10) &lt; (60/10)

So, the correct comparison is:

(5/10) &lt; (6/1)

In terms of the situation, having 5 parts out of 10 is less than having 6 whole items. The 6 whole items have a total of 6 x 10 = 60 parts, which is more than the 5 parts.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare these fractions, we can rewrite the second fraction with a common denominator, which is 10. So, we can rewrite the second fraction as:

            Given the results you obtained from the previous question, let's alter the fractions slightly. Now, compare the following expressions:

(8 / 2) _ (9 / 9)

Fill in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or = to indicate whether the first fraction is less than, greater than, or equal to the second fraction. What changes when the denominator of the second fraction is 9 instead of 10?

What changed when the denominator of the second fraction became 9 instead of 10 is that the value of the second fraction changed from 1.11 to 1. This made the comparison simpler, as 4 is clearly greater than 1.

In the second fraction, (1 / 10), the whole is divided into 10 parts, and 1 part is taken.

Since 10 is greater than 5, the parts in the second fraction are smaller. Therefore, 1 part out of 10 is smaller than 1 part out of 5.

            Now reconsider the previous fractions, only this time they have slightly changed:

Compare the values of the following fractions by completing the sentence with one of the following options: &lt;, &gt;, or = :

(9 / 3) _ (4 / 2)

Think of this like the previous situation, but instead of the second fraction having a numerator of 4 and a denominator of 8, it now has a numerator of 4 and denominator of 2. How does this change the comparison?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare these fractions, we need to find their equivalent decimal values.

(8 / 10) = 0.8
(2 / 8) = 0.25

Since 0.8 is greater than 0.25, we can conclude that:

(8 / 10) &gt; (2 / 8)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 3 is 6. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

(4/6) = (4/6) (no change needed)

Now we can compare:

(4/6) ? (12/6)

Since 4 is less than 12, we can conclude that:
