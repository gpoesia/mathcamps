            In their game, Kyle threw a ball for a distance of 18/4 yards, while Lisa threw the same ball for a distance of 19/9 yards. How many yards did the ball travel in total?
        </p>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance, we need to add the distances thrown by Kyle and Lisa. 

First, let's simplify the fractions: 
Kyle threw the ball for 18/4 yards, which is equal to 9/2 yards (since 18 Ã· 2 = 9 and 4 Ã· 2 = 2). 
Lisa threw the ball for 19/9 yards, which is equal to 2 1/9 yards (since 19 Ã· 9 = 2 with a remainder of 1).

Now, let's convert the mixed number to an improper fraction: 
2 1/9 = (2 Ã— 9 + 1) / 9 = 19/9.

Now we can add the distances: 
(9/2) + (19/9) = (81/18) + (38/18) = 119/18.

To convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 
119 Ã· 18 = 6 with a remainder of 11, so the mixed number is 6 11/18.

            After both Kyle and Lisa's throws, the ball bounced an additional 3/13 yards. Subtract this distance from the total distance the ball traveled when Kyle and Lisa threw it. What is the remaining distance?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found the total distance the ball traveled when Kyle and Lisa threw it: 6 11/18 yards.

To subtract the additional distance the ball bounced, we need to convert both distances to improper fractions:

6 11/18 = (6 Ã— 18 + 11) / 18 = 119/18 yards (which we already found)

3/13 yards is already an improper fraction.

Now, let's subtract the distances:

(119/18) - (3/13) = (1691/234) - (54/234) = 1637/234

To convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

1637 Ã· 234 = 7 with a remainder of 13, so the mixed number is 7 13/234.

First, let's simplify the fractions:
Kyle threw the ball for 15/4 yards, which is equal to 15/4 yards (no simplification needed).
Lisa threw the ball for 19/9 yards, which is equal to 2 1/9 yards (since 19 Ã· 9 = 2 with a remainder of 1).

Now, let's convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:
2 1/9 = (2 Ã— 9 + 1) / 9 = 19/9.

Now we can add the distances:
(15/4) + (19/9) = (135/36) + (76/36) = 211/36.

To convert the improper fraction back to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total number of bananas given to Johnnie, we need to add the number of bananas given in the morning and afternoon. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 7 and 14 is 14. So, we can convert 18/7 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 14:

18/7 = (18 Ã— 2)/(7 Ã— 2) = 36/14

Now we can add the two fractions:

36/14 + 12/14 = (36 + 12)/14 = 48/14

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

48/14 = (48 Ã· 2)/(14 Ã· 2) = 24/7

So, Johnnie the monkey was given 24/7 bananas in total.

To find the total number of bananas Johnnie received over the two days, we can add the number of bananas received on each day:

24/7 + 24/7 = (24 + 24)/7 = 48/7

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance, we need to add the distance from the floor to the bottom of the door and the distance from the ceiling to the top of the door.

The distance from the floor to the bottom of the door is 4/19 inches.
The distance from the ceiling to the top of the door is 1 - 9/10 = 1/10 inches (since the top of the door is 9/10 inches from the ceiling, the distance from the ceiling to the top of the door is 1 - 9/10).

Now, we add the two distances: 4/19 + 1/10 = (4*10 + 1*19) / (19*10) = (40 + 19) / 190 = 59 / 190 inches.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 3 and 11 is 33. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 33:

17/3 = (17 Ã— 11) / (3 Ã— 11) = 187/33

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 33 and 18 is 198. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 198:

142/33 = (142 Ã— 6) / (33 Ã— 6) = 852/198

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 19 is 247. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 247:

10/13 = (10*19)/(13*19) = 190/247
16/19 = (16*13)/(19*13) = 208/247

Now we can add:

190/247 + 208/247 = (190+208)/247 = 398/247

So, Captain Silverbeard found a total of 398/247 of the treasure map.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that Captain Silverbeard found 398/247 of the treasure map from the first two sites. Now, he finds another piece that is 15/17 of the total map. To add this to the previous portion, we need to convert 15/17 to a fraction with a denominator of 247:

15/17 = (15*247)/(17*247) = 3715/4199

Now, we can add the two fractions:

398/247 + 3715/4199

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 247 and 4199 is 1038083. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1038083:

398/247 = (398*4199)/(247*4199) = 1669202/1038083
3715/4199 = (3715*247)/(4199*247) = 918155/1038083

Now we can add:

1669202/1038083 + 918155/1038083 = (1669202+918155)/1038083 = 2587357/1038083

So, Captain Silverbeard now has a total of 2587357/1038083 of the treasure map.

10/9 = (10*19)/(9*19) = 190/171
16/19 = (16*9)/(19*9) = 144/171

Now we can add:

190/171 + 144/171 = (190+144)/171 = 334/171

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the distances traveled in each direction. However, we need to make sure the units are the same. Let's convert both fractions to have a common denominator, which is 48.

9/6 = (9*8)/(6*8) = 72/48
2/16 = (2*3)/(16*3) = 6/48

Now we can add the distances:
72/48 + 6/48 = 78/48

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:
78 Ã· 6 = 13
48 Ã· 6 = 8

So, the total distance traveled is 13/8 miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found the total distance traveled by the hiker before walking South: 13/8 miles.

Now, let's convert the additional distance walked South to have a common denominator with 13/8, which is 8:
8/14 = (8*4)/(14*4) = 32/56
To make it easier to add, we can convert 13/8 to have a denominator of 56:
13/8 = (13*7)/(8*7) = 91/56

Now we can add the distances:
91/56 + (-32/56) = 59/56

The negative sign is used because the hiker walked South, which is opposite to walking North.

So, the total distance traveled by the hiker now is 59/56 miles.

He also has 13/4 pairs from various incomplete sets.
To find the total number of pairs, we add the two amounts together: 4/4 + 13/4 = 17/4.
To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. So, the fraction remains 17/4.
Since 4 is the denominator, we can convert the fraction to a mixed number by dividing 17 by 4: 17 Ã· 4 = 4 with a remainder of 1. So, the mixed number is 4 1/4.

He also had 13/4 pairs from various incomplete sets.
To find the total number of pairs he had initially, we add the two amounts together: 4/4 + 13/4 = 17/4.
Now, he buys an additional 13/3 pairs of pants. To add this to his initial total, we need to find a common denominator between 4 and 3, which is 12. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 12:
17/4 = (17 Ã— 3)/(4 Ã— 3) = 51/12
13/3 = (13 Ã— 4)/(3 Ã— 4) = 52/12
Now, we can add the two amounts together: 51/12 + 52/12 = 103/12.
To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. So, the fraction remains 103/12.
Since 12 is the denominator, we can convert the fraction to a mixed number by dividing 103 by 12: 103 Ã· 12 = 8 with a remainder of 7. So, the mixed number is 8 7/12.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance Jack rode his scooter, we need to add the distances he traveled to the library and to his grandparents' house.

First, we need to convert both fractions to have a common denominator, which is 45. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

3/9 = 15/45
17/15 = 51/45

Now, we can add the distances:

15/45 + 51/45 = 66/45

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

66 Ã· 3 = 22
45 Ã· 3 = 15

So, the simplified fraction is:

First, we can simplify the fraction 20/12 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

20 Ã· 4 = 5
12 Ã· 4 = 3

So, the simplified fraction is:

5/3

To convert this to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

To add these mixed numbers, we need to convert them to improper fractions:

1 7/15 = 22/15
1 2/3 = 5/3

Now, we can add the fractions:

22/15 + 5/3

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

In the morning, the tree produced 10/11 bushels of apples.
In the afternoon, the tree produced 17/11 bushels of apples.

To add these fractions, we need to have the same denominator, which is 11 in this case. So, we can add the numerators (10 and 17) and keep the same denominator:

(10 + 17)/11 = 27/11

In the morning, the tree produced 10/9 bushels of apples.
In the afternoon, the tree produced 17/11 bushels of apples.

To add these fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 11, which is 99. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 99:

(10/9) Ã— (11/11) = 110/99
(17/11) Ã— (9/9) = 153/99

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 14. So, we can convert 1 mile to 14/14 miles.

Now, we can add the fractions:
3/14 + 14/14 = 17/14

To add these fractions, we can add the numerators (4 + 14) and keep the same denominator (14):

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total length of fabric Maria uses, we need to add the lengths of fabric used for both sections.

For the first section, Maria uses 15/10 yards of fabric. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

15 Ã· 5 = 3
10 Ã· 5 = 2

So, Maria uses 3/2 yards of fabric for the first section.

For the second section, Maria uses 9/18 more yards of fabric. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9:

9 Ã· 9 = 1
18 Ã· 9 = 2

So, Maria uses 1/2 yards of fabric for the second section.

To find the total length of fabric, we add the lengths of fabric used for both sections:

3/2 + 1/2 = 4/2

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

4 Ã· 2 = 2

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            At the end of a rainbow, there are pots filled with magical gold coins. One pot contains 12/13 of a pound of gold coins while another contains 3/2 pounds of gold coins. How much gold is there in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of gold, we need to add the amount of gold in both pots. However, the amounts are given in different units, so we need to convert them to the same unit. Let's convert both amounts to pounds.

The first pot contains 12/13 of a pound, which is already in pounds.

The second pot contains 3/2 pounds, which is already in pounds.

Now, we can add the amounts:

12/13 + 3/2 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 26. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 26:

12/13 = 24/26
3/2 = 39/26

Now, we can add:

24/26 + 39/26 = 63/26

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 13:

63 Ã· 13 = 4.85
26 Ã· 13 = 2

So, the total amount of gold is 4.85/2 pounds.

First, let's convert the fractions to decimals: 
6/20 = 0.3 pounds of food to the monkeys
18/19 = 0.947 (approximately) pounds of food to the giraffes

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of silver, we need to add the initial amount to the additional amount. To do this, we need to have the same denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 14 and 19 is 266. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 266:

5/14 = (5*19)/(14*19) = 95/266
18/19 = (18*14)/(19*14) = 252/266

Now we can add:

95/266 + 252/266 = 347/266

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 7:

347 Ã· 7 = 49.57 (approximately)
266 Ã· 7 = 38

So, the jeweler has approximately 49.57/38 pounds of silver. Since we can't have a fraction of a pound, we can convert the mixed number to a decimal:

49.57 Ã· 38 â‰ˆ 1.30 pounds

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to convert the mixed number 2 7/30 to an improper fraction:

2 7/30 = (2*30 + 7)/30 = 67/30

Now, we can add the additional 11/5 dollars Jake found:

67/30 + 11/5 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 30 and 5 is 30. So, we can convert the second fraction to have a denominator of 30:

11/5 = (11*6)/(5*6) = 66/30

Now, we can add the two fractions:

67/30 + 66/30 = 133/30

To convert this to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

133 Ã· 30 = 4 with a remainder of 13

So, the mixed number is 4 13/30.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 8 and 15 is 120. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 120:

9/8 = (9*15)/(8*15) = 135/120
20/15 = (20*8)/(15*8) = 160/120

Now, we can add the two fractions:

135/120 + 160/120 = 295/120

To convert this to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

295 Ã· 120 = 2 with a remainder of 55

So, the mixed number is 2 55/120.

We can simplify the fraction 55/120 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

55 Ã· 5 = 11
120 Ã· 5 = 24

So, the simplified mixed number is 2 11/24.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the combined height, we need to add the heights of the front and back portions of the chair.

The front half of the chair measures 5/2 feet high. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. So, the front half measures 5/2 = 2.5 feet high.

The back portion of the chair measures 20/14 feet high. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. So, the back portion measures 20/14 = 10/7 = 1.43 feet high (approximately).

Now, we can add the heights of the front and back portions: 2.5 + 1.43 = 3.93 feet.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of shirts John donated, we need to multiply 5 by 12/9. This is equivalent to multiplying 5 by 12 and then dividing by 9.

5 Ã— 12 = 60
60 Ã· 9 = 20/3 = 6.67 (but we can't donate a fraction of a shirt, so we'll round down to 6)

John donated 6 shirts to charity. To find the number of shirts he has left, we subtract the number of shirts he donated from the total number of shirts he had:

5 - 6 = -1 (but we can't have a negative number of shirts, so we'll re-evaluate the problem)

Let's convert the fraction 12/9 to a decimal: 12/9 = 1.33. This means John donated 1.33 times as many shirts as he had, which doesn't make sense. The problem is likely incorrect, and we need more information to solve it accurately.

However, if we assume the problem is correct, we can continue with the calculation:

John donated 1.33 Ã— 5 = 6.67 shirts (again, we can't donate a fraction of a shirt, so we'll round down to 6)

John has 5 - 6 = -1 shirts left (but we can't have a negative number of shirts)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the length of the jacket after the alteration, we need to subtract the length cut off from the original length.

Original length = 14/3 meters
Length cut off = 14/16 meters

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 48. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 48:

Original length = (14/3) Ã— (16/16) = 224/48 meters
Length cut off = (14/16) Ã— (3/3) = 42/48 meters

Now, we can subtract:

New length = 224/48 - 42/48 = 182/48 meters

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

New length = (182 Ã· 2) / (48 Ã· 2) = 91/24 meters

Now, we need to subtract the additional length cut off:

Length cut off = 9/4 meters

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 24. So, we can convert the length cut off to have a denominator of 24:

Length cut off = (9/4) Ã— (6/6) = 54/24 meters

Time to build the frame = 5/3 hours
Time to upholster = 10/13 hours

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 39. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 39:

Time to build the frame = (5/3) Ã— (13/13) = 65/39 hours
Time to upholster = (10/13) Ã— (3/3) = 30/39 hours

Now, we can add the two times:

Total time = 65/39 + 30/39 = 95/39 hours

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. So, the total time remains:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that the time it takes to build the chair and do the upholstery work is 95/39 hours. Now, we need to add the time it takes to apply the varnish, which is 8/19 hours.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 741. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 741:

Time to build and upholster = (95/39) Ã— (19/19) = 1805/741 hours
Time to apply varnish = (8/19) Ã— (39/39) = 312/741 hours

Now, we can add the two times:

            In another batch of chair production, Mr. Carpenter managed to reduce his timeframe. Now, he takes only 5/10 hours to build the frame of the chair while the time for upholstery stays the same as 10/13 hours.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total time it takes for Mr. Carpenter to build a chair, we need to add the time it takes to build the frame and the time it takes to upholster it.

Time to build the frame = 5/10 hours
Time to upholster = 10/13 hours

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 130. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 130:

Time to build the frame = (5/10) Ã— (13/13) = 65/130 hours
Time to upholster = (10/13) Ã— (10/10) = 100/130 hours

Now, we can add the two times:

Total time = 65/130 + 100/130 = 165/130 hours

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5. So, we get:

            Following up on the previous scenario, Miss Daisy finds an additional 11/11 kg of fertilizer in her shed. After she took away 17/20 kg from the original 19/6 kg to use on her roses, she added this new amount to the fertilizer she had left. How much fertilizer does she have now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found out that Miss Daisy had 139/60 kg of fertilizer left after using 17/20 kg on her roses.

Now, she finds an additional 11/11 kg of fertilizer, which is equal to 60/60 kg (since 11/11 is equal to 1 whole).

To find the total amount of fertilizer she has now, we add the amount she had left to the new amount:

139/60 + 60/60 = 199/60

So, Miss Daisy has 199/60 kg of fertilizer now.

            Continuing from the scenario, suppose instead of the initial 19/6 kg of fertilizers, Miss Daisy had only 14/6 kg of fertilizers. If she still uses 17/20 kg on her roses, how much fertilizers does she have left to use on her other flowers now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Again, we need to subtract the amount Miss Daisy used on her roses from the total amount she had.

First, we need to convert both fractions to have a common denominator, which is 60. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

14/6 = 140/60
17/20 = 51/60

Now, we can subtract:

140/60 - 51/60 = 89/60

So, Miss Daisy has 89/60 kg of fertilizer left to use on her other flowers.

            Scientists have discovered that the moon is slowly moving away from Earth. If the distance increases by 4/16 meters every year, and unexpectedly there was an additional increase of 20/6 meters this year, what is the total change in distance this year?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total change in distance, we need to add the regular increase in distance to the additional increase.

First, let's convert the regular increase from an improper fraction to a mixed number: 4/16 = 1/4 meter per year.

Next, let's convert the additional increase from an improper fraction to a mixed number: 20/6 = 3 2/3 meters.

Now, we can add the two increases together: 1/4 + 3 2/3 = 3 11/12 meters.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can simplify the fractions by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. 
5/5 = 1 (since 5 is divisible by 5)
12/18 = 2/3 (since 6 is the greatest common divisor of 12 and 18)

The shark swam 1 mile in the morning and 2/3 miles in the afternoon. 
To add these distances, we need a common denominator, which is 3. 
So, we can convert 1 mile to 3/3 miles. 
Now, we can add: 
3/3 + 2/3 = 5/3 

The shark swam a total distance of 5/3 miles.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can simplify the fraction 18/9 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9. 
18/9 = 2 (since 18 is divisible by 9)

The shark swam an additional 2 miles in the evening. 
To find the total distance, we add the distance swam in the morning and afternoon (5/3 miles) to the distance swam in the evening (2 miles). 
To add these distances, we need a common denominator, which is 3. 
So, we can convert 2 miles to 6/3 miles. 
Now, we can add: 
5/3 + 6/3 = 11/3

5/12 is already in its simplest form.
12/18 = 2/3 (since 6 is the greatest common divisor of 12 and 18)

The shark swam 5/12 miles in the morning and 2/3 miles in the afternoon. 
To add these distances, we need a common denominator, which is 12. 
So, we can convert 2/3 miles to 8/12 miles (by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 4).

To reduce their combined typing speed by 2 words every 11 seconds, we need to find the reduction in words per second. There are 11 seconds, so the reduction in words per second is:
2 words / 11 seconds = 2/11 words per second

Now, we subtract this reduction from their initial combined typing speed:
3.5 words/second - 2/11 words/second = 3.5 - 0.1818... = 3.3181...

9/8 = (9 x 5)/(8 x 5) = 45/40
2/10 = (2 x 4)/(10 x 4) = 8/40

Now we can add:

45/40 + 8/40 = 53/40

To convert this back to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

53 Ã· 40 = 1 with a remainder of 13

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to subtract the performance time from the break time. First, let's convert the mixed number 1 13/40 to an improper fraction:

1 13/40 = (1 x 40)/40 + 13/40 = 40/40 + 13/40 = 53/40

Now, we can subtract the performance time from the break time:

Break time: 13/5 = (13 x 8)/(5 x 8) = 104/40
Performance time: 53/40

Subtracting the performance time from the break time:

104/40 - 53/40 = 51/40

To convert this back to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's first find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 14 and 4 is 28. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 28:

Machine 1: 4/14 = (4*2)/(14*2) = 8/28
Machine 2: 20/4 = (20*7)/(4*7) = 140/28

Now, we can add the fractions to find the total number of chairs made by both machines in one hour:

8/28 + 140/28 = 148/28

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

148 Ã· 4 = 37
28 Ã· 4 = 7

So, the simplified fraction is:

37/7

To find the total number of chairs, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

37 Ã· 7 = 5 2/7

Since we can't make a fraction of a chair, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, both machines make 5 chairs in one hour.

To add the distance swam by the great white shark, we need to convert 6/5 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 14 (the least common multiple of 5 and 14):

6/5 = 16.8/14 (approximately)

Now we can add:

16.8/14 + 9/14 = 25.8/14

To simplify, we can convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:

25.8/14 = 362/14

Dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

            Following the previous question, Lisa finds another bottle that has 6/16 gallon of milk. What is the total amount of milk Lisa has now, if you add the milk from this third bottle to the total from the first two bottles?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found that Lisa had 97/36 gallons of milk from the first two bottles. To add the milk from the third bottle, we need to convert 6/16 to have a denominator of 36:

6/16 = (6*9)/(16*9) = 54/144 = (54/4)/(144/4) = 27/36

Now we can add:

97/36 + 27/36 = 124/36

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

124/36 = (124/4)/(36/4) = 31/9

So, Lisa has 31/9 gallons of milk in total now.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The tree grows 1/10 of its height every month, but we don't know the total height of the tree. However, we are asked to find the total growth this month, which includes the additional growth due to the fertilizer.

The additional growth due to the fertilizer is 12/6 = 2 feet.

The total growth this month is the growth due to the natural growth (1/10 of its height) plus the growth due to the fertilizer (2 feet). Since we don't know the total height of the tree, we can't find the natural growth, but we know it's 1/10 of the total height. Let's call the total height &quot;h&quot;. Then, the natural growth is h/10.

The total growth this month is h/10 + 2.

However, since we don't know the total height &quot;h&quot;, we can't find the exact total growth. But we can say that the total growth is h/10 + 2, where h is the total height of the tree.

8/20 = (8*11)/(20*11) = 88/220

Now we can add the fractions:

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

Now, we need to add the area of the third tent to this total. To do this, we need to convert the third tent's area to have a denominator of 55, which is the least common multiple of 55 and 10:

1/10 = (1*5.5)/(10*5.5) = 5.5/55

Now we can add the areas:

10/20 = 1/2 (since 10 is half of 20)

Now we can add the fractions:

13/11 + 1/2 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 11 and 2 is 22. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 22:

13/11 = (13*2)/(11*2) = 26/22

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The original length of the sleeping bag is 18/19 meters. The extension adds 8/11 meters to the original length. To find the total length, we need to add the original length and the extension length.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 19 and 11 is 209. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 209:

18/19 = (18*11)/(19*11) = 198/209
8/11 = (8*19)/(11*19) = 152/209

Now we can add the two fractions:

198/209 + 152/209 = (198 + 152)/209 = 350/209

So, the total length of the sleeping bag now is 350/209 meters.

            Considering the previous problem, what if Lucy's initial sleeping bag was 18/19 meter long and her extension was only 8/8 meter long. What would be the total length of her sleeping bag then?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The original length of the sleeping bag is 18/19 meters. The extension adds 8/8 meters to the original length. Since 8/8 is equal to 1, the extension is 1 meter long.

To find the total length, we can add the original length and the extension length:

18/19 + 1 = ?

To add these two values, we need to convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:

1 = 19/19 (since 19/19 = 1)

Now we can add the two fractions:

18/19 + 19/19 = (18 + 19)/19 = 37/19

So, the total length of the sleeping bag now is 37/19 meters.

To do this, we need to have the same denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 2 is 26. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 26:

10/13 = (10*2)/(13*2) = 20/26
8/2 = (8*13)/(2*13) = 104/26

Now we can add the two fractions:

20/26 + 104/26 = (20 + 104)/26 = 124/26

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:

124/26 = (124/2)/(26/2) = 62/13

So, there are 62/13 gallons of water in the container now.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of water, we need to add the initial amount of water to the additional amount of water. 

The initial amount of water is 10/13 gallons.

The additional amount of water is 16/2 gallons, which can be simplified to 8 gallons (since 16 divided by 2 is 8).

Now we can add the two amounts:

10/13 + 8 = ?

To add a fraction and a whole number, we need to convert the whole number to a fraction with a denominator of 1:

8 = 8/1

Now we can add:

10/13 + 8/1 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 1, which is 13. So, we can convert the second fraction to have a denominator of 13:

8/1 = (8*13)/(1*13) = 104/13

Now we can add:

10/13 + 104/13 = (10 + 104)/13 = 114/13

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 16. So, we can convert 11 to 11 Ã— 16/16 = 176/16.

Maria also has 20 stickers and she gives one sticker to each of her 20 friends. So, each of her 20 friends gets 1 sticker.

Since Maria has 6 friends who get candies and 20 friends who get stickers, we need to find the common friends who get both candies and stickers. Let's assume Maria has x friends who are common to both groups. Then, we can set up the equation: x + (20 - x) = 6, where x is the number of common friends and (20 - x) is the number of friends who only get stickers. Solving for x, we get x = 6, which means all 6 friends who get candies also get stickers.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's calculate the total yards of fabric Jane would have cut in this new scenario.

First, Jane cuts 11/12 yard from the blanket.

Then, she cuts an additional 10/10 yard, which is equal to 1 yard (since 10/10 = 1).

To find the total yards of fabric Jane has cut, we add the two amounts:

11/12 + 1 = ?

To add these two quantities, we need to convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:

11/12 = 11/12 (no change needed)
1 = 12/12 (convert 1 to an improper fraction with a denominator of 12)

Now we can add the fractions:

11/12 + 12/12 = 23/12

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 (since 23 and 12 do not have a common divisor other than 1):

23 Ã· 1 = 23
12 Ã· 1 = 12

So, the simplified fraction is:

23/12

To convert this to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

23 Ã· 12 = 1 with a remainder of 11

So, the mixed number is:

1 11/12

            A fairy sprinkles 11/12 oz of magic dust over an enchanted field. She then sprinkles an additional 9/10 oz of dust over a grove of enchanted apple trees. 

Then, she flies over to a nearby forest where she originally had 14/3 oz of magic dust. After using the dust over the field and apple trees, how much magic dust is left for the fairy now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, let's find the total amount of magic dust used by the fairy.

11/12 oz + 9/10 oz = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 60.

11/12 = (11*5)/(12*5) = 55/60
9/10 = (9*6)/(10*6) = 54/60

Now we can add the two amounts:

55/60 + 54/60 = (55 + 54)/60 = 109/60

To convert this fraction to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

109 Ã· 60 = 1 with a remainder of 49

So, the total amount of magic dust used is 1 49/60 oz.

Now, let's subtract this amount from the original amount of magic dust the fairy had:

14/3 oz - 1 49/60 oz = ?

To subtract these mixed numbers, we need to convert them to improper fractions:

14/3 = (14*3)/(3*3) = 42/9
1 49/60 = (1*60 + 49)/60 = 109/60

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

42/9 - 109/60 = ?

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 180.

42/9 = (42*20)/(9*20) = 840/180
109/60 = (109*3)/(60*3) = 327/180

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

840/180 - 327/180 = (840 - 327)/180 = 513/180

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

513 Ã· 3 = 171
180 Ã· 3 = 60

So, the simplified fraction is:

171/60

To convert this fraction to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

171 Ã· 60 = 2 with a remainder of 51

So, the amount of magic dust left for the fairy is 2 51/60 oz.

First, let's convert both fractions to have a common denominator, which is 60.

16/10 = (16*6)/(10*6) = 96/60

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total number of pages initially, we need to convert the mixed fraction 4/1 to an improper fraction, which is 4. 

Now, we need to subtract 14/9 from 4. To do this, we need to find a common denominator between 9 and 1, which is 9. So, we can rewrite 4 as 36/9.

Now, we can subtract: 36/9 - 14/9 = 22/9.

Now, we can add: 2 16/36 + 21/36 = 2 37/36.

To convert this back to a mixed fraction, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 37 Ã· 36 = 1 with a remainder of 1. So, we add 1 to the whole number part: 2 + 1 = 3. The mixed fraction is 3 1/36.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add the weights of the apples, we need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 8 is 40. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 40:

3/20 = (3*2)/(20*2) = 6/40
18/8 = (18*5)/(8*5) = 90/40

Now we can add the weights:

6/40 + 90/40 = (6+90)/40 = 96/40

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8:

96/40 = (96/8)/(40/8) = 12/5

Morning: 12/17 = (12*19)/(17*19) = 228/323
Evening: 8/19 = (8*17)/(19*17) = 136/323

Now we can add the two fractions:

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 323 and 20 is 6460. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 6460:

Day: 364/323 = (364*20)/(323*20) = 7280/6460
Night: 19/20 = (19*323)/(20*323) = 6137/6460

Now we can add the two fractions:

7280/6460 + 6137/6460 = (7280 + 6137)/6460 = 13417/6460

First segment: (18/19) Ã— (17/17) = 306/323 miles
Second segment: (9/17) Ã— (19/19) = 171/323 miles

Now we can add the two segments:

Total flight = 306/323 + 171/323 = 477/323 miles

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 29:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance, we need to add the lengths of the two slides. However, we need to make sure we have a common denominator before adding. The least common multiple of 19 and 4 is 76. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 76:

6/19 = (6*4)/(19*4) = 24/76
17/4 = (17*19)/(4*19) = 323/76

Now we can add:

24/76 + 323/76 = 347/76

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. So, the total distance is:

347/76 = 4.51 meters (approximately)

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down into two parts: the amount of firewood burned in the early morning and the amount burned in the late night.

In the early morning, the fireplace burns firewood at a rate of 4/15 cords per hour. Since we're interested in the amount burned in one hour, we can simply take the rate as the amount burned: 4/15 cords.

In the late night, the fireplace burns firewood at a rate of 14/15 cords per hour. Again, we can take the rate as the amount burned in one hour: 14/15 cords.

To find the total amount of firewood burned, we add the amounts burned in the early morning and late night: (4/15) + (14/15) = (4 + 14)/15 = 18/15 = 1 3/15 = 1.2 cords.

            An alien travelled 9/20 of a light year towards earth then decided to move forward another 11/7 light years. How many light years has the alien travelled in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the two distances. However, we need to have the same units for both distances. Since 9/20 is a fraction of a light year, we can leave it as is. The second distance, 11/7, is also a fraction of a light year, so we can add the two fractions.

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 7 is 140. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 140:

9/20 = (9*7)/(20*7) = 63/140
11/7 = (11*20)/(7*20) = 220/140

Now we can add the fractions:

63/140 + 220/140 = 283/140

So, the alien has traveled a total distance of 283/140 light years.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, let's evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

(9/20) + (11/7) = (63/140) + (220/140) = 283/140

So, the alien has traveled 283/140 light years initially.

Then, the alien continues its journey for an additional 14/2 light years. To add this to the initial distance, we need to convert 14/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 140:

14/2 = (14*70)/(2*70) = 980/140

Now, we can add the two distances:

283/140 + 980/140 = 1263/140

So, the alien has traveled a total distance of 1263/140 light years.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's evaluate the expression (9/20) + (11/11).

(9/20) is a fraction, and (11/11) is equal to 1, since 11 divided by 11 is 1.

So, we can rewrite the expression as:

(9/20) + 1

To add a fraction and a whole number, we can convert the whole number to a fraction with a denominator of 1:

1 = 20/20 (since 20/20 = 1)

Now we can add the fractions:

(9/20) + (20/20) = (9 + 20)/20 = 29/20

So, the alien would have traveled 29/20 light years.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Bob has 10/2 = 5/1 = 5 slices of a cucumber, which means he has 5/8 of a whole cucumber (since a whole cucumber has 8 slices).

He adds 1/7 of another cucumber, which is equivalent to 1/7 Ã— 8 = 8/7 slices.

To find the total number of slices, we add the number of slices Bob already has to the new slices: 5 + 8/7 = 5 Ã— 7/7 + 8/7 = 43/7 slices.

Since a whole cucumber has 8 slices, we can convert the total number of slices to a mixed number: 43/7 = 6 1/7.

So, Bob has a total of 6 1/7 cucumbers.
