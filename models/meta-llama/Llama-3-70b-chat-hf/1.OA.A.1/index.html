        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Aliyah correctly guessed 11 letter games initially.
Then, she correctly guessed 7 more games, so she had 11 + 7 = 18 correct guesses.
After losing 6 times, she still had 18 correct guesses, as losing doesn't change the number of correct guesses she already had.

9 - 6 = 3

However, wait a minute! Mary can't give away 6 dolls if she only has 9. She can only give away up to 9 dolls. If she gives away 6, she will be left with:

9 - 6 = 3

But if she tries to give away 6 dolls and she only has 9, she will be short of 3 dolls to give away. So, in this scenario, it doesn't make sense to give away 6 dolls.

To find the number of rooms above the ground floor, we can subtract the number of rooms on the ground floor from the total number of rooms.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Emma's total flying time is the sum of the flying time to her layover and the flying time from her layover to her final destination. 
The flying time to her layover is 9 hours. 
The flying time from her layover to her final destination is 3 hours. 
So, her total flying time is 9 + 3 = 12 hours.

            Suppose instead of the baby T-Rex having 3 teeth to start with, it only had 1 tooth when it was born. If it still grows 3 additional teeth each week, how many teeth will the baby T-Rex have after one week?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The baby T-Rex had 1 tooth initially. Since it grows 3 more teeth every week, after one week, it will have 1 + 3 = 4 teeth.
