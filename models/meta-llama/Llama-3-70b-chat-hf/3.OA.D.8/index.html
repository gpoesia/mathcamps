    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The factory initially had 33 chocolate bars. 
6 chocolate bars were given away as samples, leaving 33 - 6 = 27 chocolate bars.
Then, 3 chocolate bars were used for quality control testing, leaving 27 - 3 = 24 chocolate bars.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The factory had 24 chocolate bars left after the inventory.
To match the number of remaining chocolate bars, they produced 24 new chocolate bars.
Now, the total number of chocolate bars at the factory is 24 (initial) + 24 (new) = 48 chocolate bars.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

Let's subtract 45 from 48:

48 - 45 = 3

Wait, that's not right! You can't have 3 pairs left if you sold 45 pairs when you only had 48 to begin with. This means you sold more pairs than you had, which isn't possible.

Let's re-think this:

You sold 45 pairs, but you only had 48 pairs to begin with. This means you sold almost all of them, and you have very few pairs left.

Let's subtract 45 from 48:

48 - 45 = 3

But this time, we know that 3 is not the correct answer. Since you can't sell more pairs than you have, we need to find the correct number of pairs left.

Let's think about it... If you sold 45 pairs and you had 48 pairs to begin with, that means you sold almost all of them. You must have very few pairs left.

The correct answer is:

48 - 45 = 3, but since you can't sell more pairs than you have, you must have sold 45 - 48 = -3 pairs too many. This means you actually have:

48 - 45 = 3, but 3 is too many, so you have:

48 - 45 = 3 - 3 = 0

You have 0 pairs left.

        One evening, a young astronomer counted 1 star in a small area of the sky. Then, he noticed that 5 more stars gradually became visible as his eyes adjusted to the darkness. After an hour, a meteor shower began and he spotted 28 more stars. How many stars did the astronomer see in total during that evening?

        In the same garden, the gardener later checked his dahlias. Initially there were 88 dahlias but then he found that some daisies were missing as well, leaving only 75 dahlias left in the garden. How many dahlias are missing from the garden?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The gardener started with 88 dahlias. After some were missing, he had 75 dahlias left. To find the number of dahlias missing, we need to subtract the number of dahlias left from the original number of dahlias.

88 (original dahlias) - 75 (dahlias left) = 13

        Let's revisit the previous situation where bees were settling in a cluster of trees. Suppose we made a mistake earlier and wrongly counted the bees. In fact, originally, there were 72 bees in the cluster of trees.

Given this correction, how many bees are now left in the cluster of trees?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The artisan starts with 75 beads. After using 55 beads, he has 75 - 55 = 20 beads left.
He then receives another shipment with the same number of beads he currently has, which is 20 beads.
So, he now has 20 + 20 = 40 new beads, in addition to the 20 beads he already had.
In total, the artisan now has 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: If there are 73 minutes past 12:00 noon, that means the time is 1:13 (73 minutes past 12:00).

If we subtract 67 minutes from 1:13, we will be subtracting 67 minutes from 73 minutes, which gives us 73 - 67 = 6 minutes.

So, the minute hand on the clock will be pointing at 6 minutes past the hour.

If we subtract 2 minutes from 1:13, we will be subtracting 2 minutes from 73 minutes, which gives us 73 - 2 = 71 minutes.

Since 71 minutes is 11 minutes past 1:00, the minute hand on the clock will be pointing at 11 minutes past the hour.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The problem states that the bus can hold up to 55 people. There is only 1 bus in the garage, so we don't need to multiply the number of buses by the capacity of each bus. The answer is simply the capacity of the bus, which is 55 people.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The bus can hold up to 55 people, including the driver. Since the driver is already occupying one seat, the bus can hold 55 - 1 = 54 passengers.

Initially, the bus has 54 passengers (since the driver is already on the bus). When 24 people get off the bus, we subtract 24 from 54 to find the number of passengers left: 54 - 24 = 30.

Adding the driver, who is still on the bus, we get a total of 30 + 1 = 31 people left on the bus.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know that the total number of beach balls fell short of 62, so let's call the total number of beach balls x. We can set up the inequality: x &lt; 62.

We also know that the total number of beach balls is the sum of the original 21 beach balls, the new batch of 21 beach balls, and the beach balls already in the storage unit. Let's call the number of beach balls in the storage unit y. Then, we can set up the equation: 21 + 21 + y = x.

Since x &lt; 62, we can substitute x with 61 (the largest possible value of x) into the equation: 21 + 21 + y = 61.

Now, we can solve for y: 42 + y = 61 --&gt; y = 61 - 42 --&gt; y = 19.
