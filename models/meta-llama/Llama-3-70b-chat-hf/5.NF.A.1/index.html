        John has been learning to add and subtract fractions at school. He was given a problem during his homework that puzzled him. He had to take the sum of 48/56 and 95/23 and then subtract 34/26 from the result. What was the value that John found for this operation? Answer in simplest form.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Find the sum of 48/56 and 95/23:

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 56 and 23 is 1624. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1624:

48/56 = (48*29)/(56*29) = 1392/1624
95/23 = (95*71)/(23*71) = 6765/1624

Now, we can add the two fractions:

(1392/1624) + (6765/1624) = (1392 + 6765)/1624 = 8157/1624

2. Subtract 34/26 from the result:

Again, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1624 and 26 is 42176. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 42176:

8157/1624 = (8157*26)/(1624*26) = 212082/42176
34/26 = (34*1624)/(26*1624) = 55336/42176

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:

(212082/42176) - (55336/42176) = (212082 - 55336)/42176 = 156746/42176

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

156746/42176 = (156746/2)/(42176/2) = 78373/21088

So, John found that the value of the operation is 78373/21088.

        First, add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65. Then subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result. What is the result expressed as a simple fraction?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65, we need to find a common denominator, which is 585. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

88/9 = 520/585
28/65 = 196/585

Now, we can add them:

520/585 + 196/585 = 716/585

Next, we need to subtract 18/37 from the result. Again, we need to find a common denominator, which is 2165. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

716/585 = 2596/2165
18/37 = 468/2165

Now, we can subtract:

2596/2165 - 468/2165 = 2128/2165

So, the result expressed as a simple fraction is:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To simplify the expression, we need to evaluate the fractions and then add them.

First, let's evaluate the fractions:

(63 / 41) = 63 รท 41 = 1 22/41
(44 / 50) = 44 รท 50 = 0.88 = 22/25

Now, let's add the fractions:

1 22/41 + 22/25 = 1 + (22/41 + 22/25)

To add the fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 41 and 25, which is 205.

So, we can rewrite the fractions with the LCM as the denominator:

22/41 = 110/205
22/25 = 88/205

Now, we can add the fractions:

1 + (110/205 + 88/205) = 1 + 198/205 = 1 198/205

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 41 and 77 is 3187. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 3187:

71/41 = (71*77)/(41*77) = 5487/3187
41/77 = (41*41)/(77*41) = 1681/3187

Now we can add:

5487/3187 + 1681/3187 = (5487 + 1681)/3187 = 7168/3187

This fraction is already in its simplest form.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the result, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 65 and 35 is 455. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 455:

10/65 = (10*7)/(65*7) = 70/455
56/35 = (56*13)/(35*13) = 728/455

Now we can add the two fractions:

70/455 + 728/455 = (70+728)/455 = 798/455

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 13:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 81 and 47 is 3789. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 3789:

97/47 = (97*81)/(47*81) = 7847/3789

Now we can add:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 88 by 1: 88/1 = 88
2. Divide 38 by 53: 38/53 = 38/53 (this is already a simplified fraction)
3. Subtract 38/53 from 88: 88 - 38/53

To subtract a fraction from a whole number, we need to convert the whole number to a fraction with a denominator of 53:

88 = 88/1 = (88 ร 53)/53 = 4696/53

Now we can subtract:

4696/53 - 38/53 = (4696 - 38)/53 = 4658/53

3. Add the two results: (80/94) + (78/59)

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 94 and 59 is 5518. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 5518:

(80/94) = (440/5518)

23/3 - 1833/1092 = ?

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 1092. So, we can rewrite 23/3 as:
23/3 = 2531/1092

Now, we can subtract:
2531/1092 - 1833/1092 = 698/1092

So, the final answer is:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum, we need to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 60 is 180. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 180:

37/18 = (37*10)/(18*10) = 370/180
24/60 = (24*3)/(60*3) = 72/180

Now we can add:

370/180 + 72/180 = (370+72)/180 = 442/180

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We already found the sum of 37/18 and 24/60 to be 221/90. Now, we need to add 92/28 to this sum.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 90 and 28 is 1260. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1260:

221/90 = (221*14)/(90*14) = 3094/1260
92/28 = (92*45)/(28*45) = 4140/1260

Now we can add:

3094/1260 + 4140/1260 = (3094+4140)/1260 = 7234/1260

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

Now we can add:

148/72 + 24/72 = (148+24)/72 = 172/72

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the final answer, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, let's add 83/73 and 53/77:

w = 83/73 + 53/77

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 73 ร 77 = 5621. So, we can rewrite the fractions with this denominator:

w = (83 ร 77) / 5621 + (53 ร 73) / 5621
w = 6401 / 5621 + 3879 / 5621
w = (6401 + 3879) / 5621
w = 10280 / 5621

Now, we need to add 80/76 to w:

Final answer = w + 80/76

Again, we need to find a common denominator, which is 5621 ร 76 = 426596. So, we can rewrite the fractions with this denominator:

Final answer = (10280 ร 76) / 426596 + (80 ร 5621) / 426596
Final answer = 781280 / 426596 + 449680 / 426596
Final answer = (781280 + 449680) / 426596
Final answer = 1230960 / 426596

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

Final answer = 307740 / 106649

14/66 = (14*10)/(66*10) = 140/660

Now we can add:

891/660 + 140/660 = 1031/660

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 11:

1031/660 = (1031/11)/(660/11) = 93/60

We can simplify further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 60. So, we can convert 73/30 to 146/60.

Now, we can add:

146/60 + 49/60 = 195/60

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

        Suppose you have the following three fractions: 82/49, 45/60, and 99/59. 

If you add the first fraction (82/49) with the second one (45/60), call this result 'd'. Then, add 'd' to the third fraction (99/59). 

What would be the resulting sum? Please provide your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result, we need to follow the order of operations.

First, let's add the first fraction (82/49) with the second one (45/60):

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 2940. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 2940:

82/49 = (82*60)/(49*60) = 4920/2940
45/60 = (45*49)/(60*49) = 2205/2940

Now, we can add them:

d = 4920/2940 + 2205/2940 = 7125/2940

Next, we need to add 'd' to the third fraction (99/59):

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 17220. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 17220:

7125/2940 = (7125*59)/(2940*59) = 42125/17220
99/59 = (99*294)/(59*294) = 29106/17220

Now, we can add them:

result = 42125/17220 + 29106/17220 = 71231/17220

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1722:

result = (71231 รท 1722) / (17220 รท 1722) = 41/10

        Solve the following two steps: first, subtract 76/30 from 91/16 and second, add the answer to 18/44. Round the final answer to the nearest hundredth.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Subtract 76/30 from 91/16

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 16 and 30 is 240. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 240:

91/16 = (91 ร 15) / (16 ร 15) = 1365/240
76/30 = (76 ร 8) / (30 ร 8) = 608/240

Now, we can subtract:

1365/240 - 608/240 = (1365 - 608) / 240 = 757/240

Step 2: Add the answer to 18/44

Again, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 240 and 44 is 1320. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1320:

757/240 = (757 ร 5.5) / (240 ร 5.5) = 4163.5/1320
18/44 = (18 ร 30) / (44 ร 30) = 540/1320

Now, we can add:

4163.5/1320 + 540/1320 = (4163.5 + 540) / 1320 = 4703.5/1320

To round the final answer to the nearest hundredth, we can convert the fraction to a decimal:

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the first part: (8 / 91) + (49 / 5)
= (8/91) + (49/5)
= (8/91) + (98.8/10) ( converted 49/5 to a decimal and then to a fraction with a denominator of 10)
= (8/91) + (980/910)
= (72+980)/910
= 1052/910

2. Simplify the fraction: 1052/910
= (2*526)/(2*455)
= 526/455

So, the result of the first part is 526/455.

3. Calculate the second part: (32 / 76)
= (32/76)
= (4*8)/(4*19)
= 8/19

4. Subtract the second part from the first part:
= 526/455 - 8/19
= (526*19)/(455*19) - (8*455)/(19*455)
= 10004/8685 - 3640/8685
= (10004-3640)/8685
= 6364/8685

5. Simplify the fraction: 6364/8685
= (4*15841)/(5*17337)

And then we added 3 / 58 to get:

Now, let's add the original result to the new result:
(260 / 147) + (15521 / 8526) = ?

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 147 and 8526 is 8526. So, we can convert the first fraction to have a denominator of 8526:
(260 / 147) = (260 * 58 / 147 * 58) = (15080 / 8526)

Now we can add:
(15080 / 8526) + (15521 / 8526) = (15080 + 15521) / 8526 = 30601 / 8526

310/297 = (310*70)/(297*70) = 21700/20790
92/70 = (92*297)/(70*297) = 27384/20790

Now we can add:

21700/20790 + 27384/20790 = (21700+27384)/20790 = 49084/20790

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

49084/20790 = (49084/2)/(20790/2) = 24542/10395

This fraction is already in its simplest form.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's redo the calculation with 77/27 instead of 74/27.

77/27 = (77*11)/(27*11) = 847/297
56/33 = (56*9)/(33*9) = 504/297

Now we can subtract:

847/297 - 504/297 = (847-504)/297 = 343/297

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7:

        Find the result when you subtract 91/65 from the sum of 96/40 and 11/99. Leave your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's find the sum of 96/40 and 11/99:

96/40 = 24/10 = 12/5
11/99 = 11/99

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 495. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 495:

12/5 = 12*99/5*99 = 2376/495
11/99 = 11*5/99*5 = 55/495

Now, we can add:

2376/495 + 55/495 = 2431/495

Next, let's subtract 91/65 from this result:

91/65 = 91*7.5/65*7.5 = 682.5/487.5

To subtract, we need a common denominator, which is 2437.5. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 2437.5:

2431/495 = 2431*4.93/495*4.93 = 11993.23/2437.5
682.5/487.5 = 682.5*5/487.5*5 = 3412.5/2437.5

Now, we can subtract:

11993.23/2437.5 - 3412.5/2437.5 = 8580.73/2437.5

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 73.75:

8580.73 รท 73.75 = 116
2437.5 รท 73.75 = 33

        If you originally had 82/5 oranges and instead of taking away 98/25 of them, you took away 98/90 oranges, how many oranges would you have left? Write the answer in the simplest form.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's convert the original fraction to a whole number by dividing the numerator by the denominator:

82/5 = 16.4

So, you have 16.4 oranges.

Now, let's convert the fraction you're taking away to a decimal:

98/90 = 1.0889

You're taking away 1.0889 oranges. To find the number of oranges left, subtract:

16.4 - 1.0889 = 15.3111

To convert this back to a mixed number, divide the decimal part by the denominator (which is 1 in this case):

15.3111 = 15 3111/10000

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1111. Therefore, the result is:

3. Add the two results: (64/50) + (70/22)

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 50 and 22 is 1100. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1100:

(64/50) = (1408/1100)
(70/22) = (3500/1100)

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

1. John calculated s by adding 24 divided by 6 to 40 divided by 53.

First, let's calculate the divisions:
24 รท 6 = 4
40 รท 53 = 40/53 (this is a fraction, not a whole number)

Now, add them together:
s = 4 + 40/53

To add a whole number and a fraction, we need to convert the whole number to a fraction with the same denominator as the fraction:
s = 4/1 + 40/53
s = (4 ร 53)/53 + 40/53
s = 212/53 + 40/53
s = (212 + 40)/53
s = 252/53

2. John then added s to itself to get b.

To add s to itself, we multiply s by 2:
b = 2 ร (252/53)
b = (2 ร 252)/53
b = 504/53

We already found the value of b:
b = 504/53

Now, John subtracted 1/87 from b to get a new value:
new value = b - 1/87

To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 53 and 87, which is 4791. Then, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 4791:

= (504 ร 90)/4791 - (1 ร 55)/4791

31/98 = (31*2)/(98*2) = 62/196
83/4 = (83*49)/(4*49) = 4077/196

Add the two fractions:

32/5 = (32*23)/(5*23) = 736/115

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions, which is 198. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

76/18 = (76*11)/(18*11) = 836/198
21/99 = (21*2)/(99*2) = 42/198

Now, we can add the fractions:

t = 836/198 + 42/198
t = (836 + 42)/198
t = 878/198

Since we have two identical fractions, the total sum, w, is:

w = t + t
w = 878/198 + 878/198
w = (878 + 878)/198
w = 1756/198

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

        First, calculate the result of 58/49 + 31/34. Then, add that result to the fraction 74/38. What is the final result as a simple fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the result of 58/49 + 31/34, we need to find a common denominator, which is 1666. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

58/49 = 1276/1666
31/34 = 899/1666

Now, we can add them:

1276/1666 + 899/1666 = 2175/1666

Next, we need to add this result to the fraction 74/38. Again, we need to find a common denominator, which is 5024. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

2175/1666 = 8712/5024
74/38 = 1952/5024

Now, we can add them:

8712/5024 + 1952/5024 = 10664/5024

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

10664/5024 = 2666/1256

This is the final result as a simple fraction.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since Olivia has read the same amount as Evan, Olivia has also read 51/18 of the novel. We can rewrite 8/42 as 4/21, which is the additional amount Olivia has read. To find the total amount Olivia has read, we add the two fractions: 

(51/18) + (4/21) = ((51*7) + (4*6)) / (18*7) = (357 + 24) / 126 = 381 / 126 

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3: 

381 รท 3 = 127 
126 รท 3 = 42

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Evan had initially read 51/18 of the novel. Olivia had read 127/42 of the novel. Since Evan finishes the same amount of his novel as Olivia had read in total, Evan reads an additional 127/42 of the novel.

To find the total amount Evan has read, we add the two fractions:

(51/18) + (127/42) = ((51*7) + (127*3)) / (18*7) = (357 + 381) / 126 = 738 / 126

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:

(3/42) + (51/18) = ((3) + (51*7/7)) / (42) = (3 + 357) / 42 = 360 / 42

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:

49/14 = (49*39)/(14*39) = 1911/546

Now we can add:

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 78 and 80 is 1560. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1560:

419/78 = (419*20)/(78*20) = 8380/1560
21/80 = (21*19.5)/(80*19.5) = 399/1560

Now we can add:

        If Alex has 69/63 gallons of orange juice and he bought additional 77/5 gallons, giving him a total of 'k' gallons. Later, he received another 47/71 gallons of orange juice from Sally. How many gallons did Alex have in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Alex initially had 69/63 gallons of orange juice. To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 63*5 = 315. So, we can convert 69/63 to 345/315 and 77/5 to 462/315. Then, we add them: 345/315 + 462/315 = 807/315. This is the total amount Alex had before receiving more from Sally.

Now, we need to add 807/315 and 47/71. Again, we need to find a common denominator, which is 315*71 = 22305. So, we can convert 807/315 to 807*71/22305 and 47/71 to 47*315/22305. Then, we add them: 807*71/22305 + 47*315/22305 = 57322/22305.

        What is the result of ((100 / 61) + ((39 / 6) + (67 / 49)))? Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
   (100 / 61) = 100/61
   (39 / 6) = 39/6 = 13/2
   (67 / 49) = 67/49

2. Now, add the results:
   (100/61) + (13/2) + (67/49)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 61, 2, and 49 is 1198. So, we can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 1198:

   (100/61) = (2000/1198)
   (13/2) = (793/1198)
   (67/49) = (174/1198)

Now, add the fractions:
   (2000/1198) + (793/1198) + (174/1198) = (2967/1198)

So, the result of the given expression is 2967/1198.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum, we need to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1 and 69 is 69. So, we can rewrite 85/1 as 85/1 = 85*69/69 = 5925/69.

Now, we can add the two fractions:
5925/69 + 83/69 = (5925 + 83)/69 = 6008/69

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. So, the simplified answer is:

43/86 = (43 ร 13) / (86 ร 13) = 559 / 1118

Now we can add:

7952 / 1118 + 559 / 1118 = (7952 + 559) / 1118 = 8511 / 1118

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 (they are coprime). So, the simplified fraction is:

10/98 = (10*16)/(98*16) = 160/1568

Now we can add:

345.5/104 = (345.5*41)/(104*41) = 14199.5/4264
42/41 = (42*104)/(41*104) = 4368/4264

1. Divide 12 by 7: 12 / 7 = 12/7
2. Divide 9 by 23: 9 / 23 = 9/23
3. Subtract the two results: (12/7) - (9/23)

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 161. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

(12/7) = (264/161)
(9/23) = (63/161)

Now, we can subtract:

(264/161) - (63/161) = (264 - 63)/161 = 201/161

So, the result is:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 61 is 1104. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1104:

51/61 = (51 ร 18) / (61 ร 18) = 918 / 1104

Now we can add the two fractions:

(5795 + 918) / 1104 = 6713 / 1104

(51 / 84) = (51 ร 3) / (84 ร 3) = 153 / 276

Now we can subtract:

(558 / 276) - (153 / 276) = (558 - 153) / 276 = 405 / 276

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:

        Let's reconsider the problem where you were adding fractions. Previously, it was asked to add 34/1 to 53/4. Now consider whether it may have been 34/97 instead of 34/1. What will be the result if you add 34/97 to 53/4? Write your answer as a mixed number.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 97 and 4 is 388. So, we can rewrite 34/97 as 136/388 and 53/4 as 206/388. Now we can add:

136/388 + 206/388 = 342/388

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

342 รท 2 = 171
388 รท 2 = 194

So, the result is 171/194.

To express this as a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

171 รท 194 = 0 with a remainder of 171

Since 171 is greater than 194, we can divide further:

171 = 194 ร 0 + 171
171 = 194 ร 1 + (-23)

So, the result is 1 23/194.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 92 by 95: 92 รท 95 = 92/95
2. Divide 4 by 74: 4 รท 74 = 4/74
3. Add the two fractions: (92/95) + (4/74)

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 95 and 74 is 7030. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 7030:

(92/95) = (2684/7030)
(4/74) = (148/7030)

Now, we can add:

(2684/7030) + (148/7030) = (2832/7030)

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We are given that v = 69/47. We need to find the value of d, which is equal to 88/72 + v.

First, let's simplify the fraction 88/72 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

88/72 = 22/18

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

d = 22/18 + 69/47

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 846 (the least common multiple of 18 and 47). We can rewrite the fractions with this common denominator:

d = 847/846 + 702/846

Now, we can add the fractions:

d = (847 + 702)/846
d = 1549/846

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The wholesaler initially had 41/26 barrels of olive oil.
They sold 41/72 barrels, so we need to subtract this amount from the initial amount:
(41/26) - (41/72) = ?

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 72*26 = 1872. So, we can rewrite the fractions with this denominator:

(41*72)/1872 - (41*26)/1872 = ?

Now we can subtract:

(41*72)/1872 - (41*26)/1872 = (41*46)/1872 = 1886/1872

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
