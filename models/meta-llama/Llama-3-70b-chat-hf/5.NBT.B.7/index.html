To find the total length of the two slides, we can simply multiply the length of one slide by 2:

These distances are perpendicular to each other, so we cannot add them directly. However, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total distance walked.

Let's consider the north-south direction as the y-axis and the east-west direction as the x-axis. The total distance walked is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 42.53 miles and 28.9 miles.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get:

Total distance = âˆš(42.53^2 + 28.9^2)

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the blanket is rectangular, its area can be found by multiplying its length by its width. Let's call the width &quot;w&quot;. We can set up the equation:

Area = Length Ã— Width
86 = 46.2 Ã— w

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The snowball grew 30.8 times its original size, so we need to multiply its original diameter by 30.8.

Original diameter = 15.8 inches
New diameter = 15.8 Ã— 30.8 = 486.64 inches

Since the diameter is 486.64 inches, we can find the radius by dividing by 2:

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Following on from our previous scenario, what if instead of 63.2 minutes, an individual or a group wants to purchase a block of 82 minutes of telescope observing time at the same rate of $6.9 per minute. How much would it cost then?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total cost, we need to multiply the cost per minute by the number of minutes.

Cost per minute = $6.9
Number of minutes = 82

Total cost = Cost per minute Ã— Number of minutes
= $6.9 Ã— 82
= $566.8

First comet's distance = 32.52 million kilometers

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the area of a rectangle, we multiply the length by the width. In this case, the length is 82.82 km and the width is 50.53 km.

Area = Length x Width
= 82.82 km x 50.53 km
= 4185.4186 kmÂ²

            In a certain puzzle game, each puzzle piece is worth 93.11 points. If a player collects 42.7 pieces, how many points would they have in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total points, we need to multiply the number of puzzle pieces by the points each piece is worth. 

Let's convert the decimal numbers to fractions to make the multiplication easier: 
93.11 = 9311/100 
42.7 = 427/10 

Now, multiply the fractions: 
(9311/100) Ã— (427/10) = (9311 Ã— 427) / (100 Ã— 10) 

To multiply the numerators, we can use the distributive property: 
9311 Ã— 427 = 9311 Ã— (400 + 20 + 7) = 3724440 + 186220 + 65177 = 3983837 

Now, multiply the denominators: 
100 Ã— 10 = 1000 

So, the product of the fractions is: 
3983837 / 1000 

To convert this back to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator: 
3983837 Ã· 1000 = 3983.837 

The player would have a total of 3983.837 points.
