Let's rephrase the question to make it clearer. If there are 10 craters on the moon after 3 new craters were spotted, how many craters were there initially?

To solve this, we can subtract 3 from the total number of craters: 10 - 3 = 7.

10 (total stones) - 5 (stones used for eyes and buttons) = 5

So, Sally used 5 stones for the nose.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know that Maria prepared a total of 10 pizzas, and 6 of them were pepperoni pizzas. To find the number of mushroom pizzas, we can subtract the number of pepperoni pizzas from the total number of pizzas.

Let's assume the number of mushroom pizzas is x. Then, we can set up the equation:

6 (pepperoni pizzas) + x (mushroom pizzas) = 10 (total pizzas)

Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10 - 6
x = 4

So, there were 4 mushroom pizzas.

Let's assume the number of rainbow dusts is x. Then, we can set up the equation:

5 (crystals) + x (rainbow dusts) = 10 (total items)

Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation, we get:

x = 10 - 5
x = 5

So, there are 5 rainbow dusts.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: If there are 10 animals in total and 9 of them are chickens, then we can subtract the number of chickens from the total number of animals to find the number of cows.

10 (total animals) - 9 (chickens) = 1

So, there is 1 animal that is not a chicken, which means there is 1 cow.

Let's set up an equation:

Total cycles = Black cycles + White cycles
10 = 8 + White cycles

Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

10 - 8 = White cycles
2 = White cycles

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know that there are 10 clouds in total. Out of these 10 clouds, 3 are dark and stormy. To find the number of fluffy and white clouds, we can subtract the number of dark and stormy clouds from the total number of clouds.

Number of fluffy and white clouds = Total number of clouds - Number of dark and stormy clouds
= 10 - 3
= 7

### Answer: 7</pre>
