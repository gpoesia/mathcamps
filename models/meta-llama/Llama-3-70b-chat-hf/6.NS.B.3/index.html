        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total weight of cucumbers, we need to multiply the average weight of one cucumber by the number of cucumbers.

First, we need to convert the number of cucumbers from a mixed number to a decimal: 18.06 = 18 6/100 = 18 + 0.06 = 18.06 (it's already in decimal form)

Now, we can multiply the average weight of one cucumber by the number of cucumbers:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The mouse runs 10.4 meters towards east, which means it is 10.4 meters away from the starting point. Then, it turns around and runs 37.12 meters towards west, which means it moves 37.12 meters back towards the starting point. Since the mouse is moving in the opposite direction, we subtract 37.12 from 10.4 to find the net distance from the starting point, which is 10.4 - 37.12 = -26.72 meters. This means the mouse is 26.72 meters away from the starting point in the west direction.

Initial weight = 81.4 kg

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many precious gems each knight receives, we need to divide the total number of gems by the number of knights. However, we need to be careful because the number of knights is a decimal value. 

First, let's convert the decimal value to a fraction: 33.2 = 332/10 = 83/2.5 = 83/2.5 = 166/5.

Now, we can divide the total number of gems by the number of knights:

3054.4 Ã· 166/5 = 3054.4 Ã— 5/166 = 3054.4 Ã— 0.03 (approximately) = 91.63 (approximately)

            After the dragon has hoarded 65.4 kilograms of gold and 28.5 kilograms of gems, he decides to add some silver to his hoard. If the dragon's total hoard is decreased by 6.74 kilograms after adding the silver, what will be the new total weight of the dragon's hoard?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know the total weight of the dragon's hoard before adding the silver:

Total weight = Weight of gold + Weight of gems
= 65.4 + 28.5
= 93.9 kg

The dragon's total hoard is decreased by 6.74 kilograms after adding the silver, so we subtract 6.74 from the original total weight:

New total weight = Original total weight - 6.74
= 93.9 - 6.74

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many rainbows the unicorn needs to consume, we need to divide the total amount of magic energy required (217.35 units) by the amount of magic energy provided by one rainbow (20.7 units).

Let's perform the division:

Since we can't have a fraction of a rainbow, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, as the unicorn needs a whole number of rainbows to teleport. Therefore, the unicorn will consume 11 rainbows.
