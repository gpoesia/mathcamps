        Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the initial number of cucumbers Carla could grow per plant. To do this, we multiply 22/3 by 22/19:

(22/3) × (22/19) = (22 × 22) / (3 × 19) = 484 / 57 = 8.49 (approximately)

So, Carla could initially grow approximately 8.49 cucumbers per plant.

To find the new number of cucumbers she can grow per plant after adjusting her production method, we multiply the initial amount by 23/17:

8.49 × (23/17) = 8.49 × 1.3529 (approximately) = 11.49 (approximately)

Therefore, Carla is expecting to grow approximately 11.49 cucumbers per plant after adjusting her production method.

        Pierre has 19/4 kg of grapes. One afternoon, he ate 7/25 kg of them. In the evening, his mother gave him 30/9 kg more grapes. How many kilograms of grapes does Pierre have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Pierre initially had 19/4 kg of grapes.
He ate 7/25 kg of grapes, so he had 19/4 - 7/25 kg of grapes left.
To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 100. So, we can convert the fractions to:
(475 - 28) / 100 = 447 / 100 kg
Then, his mother gave him 30/9 kg more grapes. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 18. So, we can convert the fractions to:
(80 + 60) / 18 = 140 / 18 kg
Simplifying, we get 70/9 kg.

        King Arthur is calculating the costs for restoring his castle. The wall repairs cost 26/22 of his castle's annual budget. Meanwhile, the moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget. Finally, installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget. How much (expressed as a fraction of the castle's annual budget) has King Arthur spent on these projects in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total cost, we need to add the fractions of the budget spent on each project. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 22, 29, and 3 is 638. 

We can rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 638:

Wall repairs: 26/22 = (26*29*3)/(22*29*3) = 2262/638
Moat renovations: 4/29 = (4*22*3)/(29*22*3) = 264/638
Defensive catapults: 11/3 = (11*22*29)/(3*22*29) = 7094/638

Now we can add the fractions:

2262/638 + 264/638 + 7094/638 = 9620/638

        A giraffe at the local zoo has a peculiar eating habit. When it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves, it eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day.

Calculate ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26))^2 * ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26)) and provide your answer.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
((25 / 19) * (30 / 26)) = (25/19) * (30/26) = (25*30) / (19*26) = 750 / 494 = 150/99

2. Raise the result to the power of 2:
(150/99)^2 = (150^2) / (99^2) = 22500 / 9801

3. Multiply the result by the original expression:

        Lara wants to make a necklace. The necklace requires (11/3) feet of yarn. She also wants to add smaller beads which will extend the length of the necklace by (8/30) feet. How many feet of materials will Lara need to make the necklace?

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total length of yarn needed, we need to add the length required for the necklace and the length added by the smaller beads.

First, let's find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 3 and 30 is 30. So, we can convert the first fraction to have a denominator of 30:

(11/3) = (11*10)/(3*10) = 110/30

Now we can add the two fractions:

(110/30) + (8/30) = (110 + 8)/30 = 118/30

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

118/30 = (118 ÷ 2)/(30 ÷ 2) = 59/15

So, Lara will need 59/15 feet of materials to make the necklace.

        Lara was pleased with her initial necklace design, but she decided she wants to add some larger beads to the necklace. These larger beads require an additional (24/17) feet of yarn. How many total feet of material will Lara now need to finish her necklace with the added beads?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found that Lara needs 59/15 feet of material for the initial necklace design. Now, we need to add the additional length required for the larger beads.

To add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 17 is 255. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 255:

(59/15) = (59*17)/(15*17) = 1003/255
(24/17) = (24*15)/(17*15) = 360/255

Now we can add the two fractions:

(1003/255) + (360/255) = (1003 + 360)/255 = 1363/255

So, Lara will now need 1363/255 feet of material to finish her necklace with the added beads.

        Lara realized that she made a slight miscalculation. The amount of smaller beads she wants to add to the necklace extends its length by (8/28) feet not by (8/30) feet as she initially thought. Given this new information, how many total feet of material will Lara need to make her necklace, before adding the larger beads?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's recalculate the total length of yarn needed using the correct information.

The length required for the necklace is still (11/3) feet. To find a common denominator for the two fractions, we can convert the first fraction to have a denominator of 28:

(11/3) = (11*28)/(3*28) = 308/84

Now we can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

308/84 = (308 ÷ 4)/(84 ÷ 4) = 77/21

Now we can add the two fractions:

(77/21) + (8/28) = (?/?)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 21 and 28 is 84. So, we can convert the first fraction to have a denominator of 84:

(77/21) = (77*4)/(21*4) = 308/84

Now we can add the two fractions:

(308/84) + (8/28) = (308/84) + (24/84) = (308 + 24)/84 = 332/84

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

332/84 = (332 ÷ 4)/(84 ÷ 4) = 83/21

So, Lara will need 83/21 feet of materials to make the necklace, before adding the larger beads.

        Two planes depart from an airport at the exact same time. Plane A is flying at a speed of 24/11 miles per minute and Plane B is flying at a speed of 26/27 miles per minute. How much farther (in miles) did Plane A travel than Plane B after exactly one minute, assuming they keep flying at a stable speed? Calculate the difference and write your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's calculate the distance traveled by each plane in one minute:

Plane A: Speed = 24/11 miles/minute
Distance = Speed × Time = (24/11) × 1 = 24/11 miles

Plane B: Speed = 26/27 miles/minute
Distance = Speed × Time = (26/27) × 1 = 26/27 miles

Now, let's find the difference in distance traveled by the two planes:

Difference = Distance traveled by Plane A - Distance traveled by Plane B
= 24/11 - 26/27

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 297 (11 × 27). So, we can rewrite the fractions with this denominator:

24/11 = (24 × 27) / (11 × 27) = 648/297
26/27 = (26 × 11) / (27 × 11) = 286/297

Now, we can subtract:

Difference = 648/297 - 286/297 = 362/297

So, Plane A traveled 362/297 miles farther than Plane B after one minute.

        Following on from the previous problem:

Let's say Plane A has slowed down slightly and is now flying at a speed of 24/11 miles per minute. Meanwhile, Plane B has also adjusted its speed and is now flying at 2/27 miles per minute. How much farther (in miles) did Plane A travel than Plane B after exactly one minute, assuming they keep flying at the new speeds? Calculate the difference and write your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's calculate the distance traveled by each plane in one minute at their new speeds:

Plane A: Speed = 24/11 miles/minute
Distance = Speed × Time = (24/11) × 1 = 24/11 miles

Plane B: Speed = 2/27 miles/minute
Distance = Speed × Time = (2/27) × 1 = 2/27 miles

Now, let's find the difference in distance traveled by the two planes:

Difference = Distance traveled by Plane A - Distance traveled by Plane B
= 24/11 - 2/27

To subtract these fractions, we can find a common denominator, which is 297 (11 × 27). So, we can rewrite the fractions with this denominator:

24/11 = (24 × 27) / (11 × 27) = 648/297
2/27 = (2 × 11) / (27 × 11) = 22/297

Now, we can subtract:

Difference = 648/297 - 22/297 = 626/297

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

626/297 = 626/297 (already simplified)

So, Plane A traveled 626/297 miles farther than Plane B after one minute at their new speeds.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total time it takes Toby to play both songs, we need to add the times it takes to play each song.

The first song takes 12/8 hours to play. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

12 ÷ 4 = 3
8 ÷ 4 = 2

So, the first song takes 3/2 hours to play.

The second song takes 12/3 hours to play. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

12 ÷ 3 = 4
3 ÷ 3 = 1

So, the second song takes 4 hours to play.

Now, we can add the times it takes to play each song:

3/2 + 4 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 2. We can convert 4 to a fraction with a denominator of 2:

4 = 8/2

Now, we can add:

3/2 + 8/2 = 11/2

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found that it takes Toby 11/2 hours to play the first two songs. Now, we need to add the time it takes to play the third song.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 14 is 14. We can convert 11/2 to a fraction with a denominator of 14:

11/2 = 77/14

Now, we can add:

77/14 + 19/14 = 96/14

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

        Toby realized that he made a mistake. His first song actually takes 12/15 hours to play, not 12/8 hours. Given this information, how long does it take Toby to play his first and second songs now? Write your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's recalculate the time it takes Toby to play both songs.

The first song takes 12/15 hours to play.

The second song takes 12/3 hours to play. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

12 ÷ 3 = 4
3 ÷ 3 = 1

So, the second song takes 4 hours to play.

To add the times, we need to find a common denominator, which is 15. We can convert 4 to a fraction with a denominator of 15:

4 = 60/15

Now, we can add:

12/15 + 60/15 = 72/15

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

72 ÷ 3 = 24
15 ÷ 3 = 5

So, it takes Toby 24/5 hours to play both of his songs.

        Suppose you have 28 out of 29 chocolate bars. Then, you found 8 out of 22 more chocolate bars. What fraction represents the total chocolate bars you have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

Initially, you have 28 out of 29 chocolate bars, which can be represented as a fraction: 28/29.

Then, you found 8 out of 22 more chocolate bars. To add these to the total, we need to find a common denominator between 29 and 22. The least common multiple (LCM) of 29 and 22 is 638. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 638:

28/29 = (28*22)/(29*22) = 616/638
8/22 = (8*29)/(22*29) = 232/638

Now, we can add the two fractions:

616/638 + 232/638 = 848/638

So, the total fraction of chocolate bars you have now is 848/638.

        A compass maker is creating some specialty compasses. 

The compass needle is made from a special material. It takes 27/26 of a pound to create one needle. 

If the maker is trying to produce two identical needles, how much material will he require? 

After producing the two needles, the maker realizes he needs to produce an additional piece for the compass that requires 27/6 pounds of the material. 

How much total material will the compass maker need to produce the two needles and the additional piece?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step.

To produce one needle, the compass maker needs 27/26 pounds of material. To produce two identical needles, he will need:

2 x (27/26) = 54/26 = 27/13 pounds of material.

To produce the additional piece, the maker needs 27/6 pounds of material. To find the total amount of material needed, we add the amount needed for the two needles and the additional piece:

(27/13) + (27/6) = (27/13) + (63/26) = (54/26) + (63/26) = 117/26 pounds of material.

        Liam bought a candle that burns at a rate of 6/4 inches per hour. After some time, he bought another candle that burns at a slower rate of 14/16 inches per hour. What is the total rate at which the two candles burn together?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total rate at which the two candles burn together, we need to add their individual burning rates.

The first candle burns at a rate of 6/4 inches per hour. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

6/4 = 3/2 inches per hour

The second candle burns at a rate of 14/16 inches per hour. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

14/16 = 7/8 inches per hour

Now, we can add the burning rates of the two candles:

3/2 + 7/8 = (3*4)/(2*4) + 7/8 = 12/8 + 7/8 = 19/8 inches per hour

The second candle now burns at a rate of 26/16 inches per hour. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

26/16 = 13/8 inches per hour

Now, we can add the burning rates of the two candles:

3/2 + 13/8 = (3*4)/(2*4) + 13/8 = 12/8 + 13/8 = 25/8 inches per hour

        Imagine you're a music producer who is working on a new song. Your resources are divided into different sections.

- First, you dedicate 16/4 hours to composing the music and another 16/29 hours to writing the lyrics. This is your initial time investment for the song (let's call it p).

- Then, you spend 28/13 hours for mixing and mastering the song in addition to the initial time investment (let's call this new total time b).

- Suddenly, a drummer you hired for a session uses 18/4 hours less because he finished his parts quickly.

What is the final time you spent on producing the song, if your total time is expressed as (b - (18 / 4))?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

Initial time investment (p) = time spent on composing music + time spent on writing lyrics
= 16/4 + 16/29
= 4 + 16/29
= 4 + 0.55 (approximately)
= 4.55 hours

Total time investment (b) = initial time investment + time spent on mixing and mastering
= 4.55 + 28/13
= 4.55 + 2.15 (approximately)
= 6.70 hours

Now, the drummer uses 18/4 hours less, which is:
= 18/4
= 4.5 hours

So, the final time spent on producing the song is:
= b - (18/4)
= 6.70 - 4.5
= 2.20 hours

Apple pie: Princess Lily ate 10 out of 12 slices, so the fraction of apple pie she ate is 10/12.

Blueberry pie: Princess Lily ate 10 out of 29 slices, so the fraction of blueberry pie she ate is 10/29.

To find the total fraction of pies she ate, we need to add these two fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 348 (12 × 29 = 348). So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 348:

Apple pie: 10/12 = (10 × 29) / (12 × 29) = 290/348
Blueberry pie: 10/29 = (10 × 12) / (29 × 12) = 120/348

Now, we can add the fractions:

(290/348) + (120/348) = (290 + 120) / 348 = 410/348

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down:

Chocolate cake: Princess Lily ate the entire 10-slice cake, so the fraction of chocolate cake she ate is 10/10 = 1.

Peach pie: Princess Lily ate 10 out of 29 slices, so the fraction of peach pie she ate is 10/29.

To find the total fraction of food she ate, we need to add these two fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 290 (10 × 29 = 290). So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 290:

Chocolate cake: 1 = (29 × 1) / (29 × 10) = 290/290
Peach pie: 10/29 = (10 × 10) / (29 × 10) = 100/290

Now, we can add the fractions:

(290/290) + (100/290) = (290 + 100) / 290 = 390/290

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:

390 ÷ 10 = 39
290 ÷ 10 = 29

So, Princess Lily ate 39/29 of the total food.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the number of colored pencils Marta uses for shading in her art projects over an 11-day period, we need to evaluate the expression (20 / 11) * (23 / 26).

First, let's simplify the fractions:

(20 / 11) = 20/11 (cannot be simplified further)
(23 / 26) = 23/26 (cannot be simplified further)

Now, multiply the two fractions:

(20/11) * (23/26) = (20*23) / (11*26) = 460 / 286

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

460 / 286 = (460 ÷ 2) / (286 ÷ 2) = 230 / 143

So, Marta uses 230/143 colored pencils for shading in her art projects over an 11-day period.

        In addition to the colored pencils Marta uses for her art projects, she also has a pack of special metallic colored pencils. She uses 8 of these special pencils every 6 days. Adding these two amounts together, how many colored pencils in total does Marta use over an 11-day period? 

To find this, you need to add the fraction of colored pencils she uses from the previous problem to the amount of metallic pencils she uses. Evaluate this by performing the operation (8 / 6) + ((20 / 11) * (23 / 26)) and write your answer as a simplified fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of colored pencils Marta uses over an 11-day period, we need to add the fraction of colored pencils she uses for shading to the number of metallic pencils she uses.

First, let's simplify the fraction of metallic pencils she uses:

(8 / 6) = 4/3 (simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2)

Next, we need to add this fraction to the fraction of colored pencils she uses for shading, which we found in the previous problem:

(4/3) + (230/143)

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 429 (the least common multiple of 3 and 143). We can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 429:

(4/3) = (572/429)
(230/143) = (230/143)

Now, we can add the fractions:

(572/429) + (230/143) = (572 + 230*3) / 429 = (572 + 690) / 429 = 1262 / 429

So, Marta uses a total of 1262/429 colored pencils over an 11-day period.

        A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspect’s involvement. Calculate the value of f.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Indicator i:**
The first specimen decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units, so the rate of decrease is 26/6.
The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units, so the rate of decrease is 25/17.
The ratio of these changes is:
i = (26/6) / (25/17) = (26 × 17) / (6 × 25) = 442 / 150 = 221/75

**Indicator h:**
The first specimen increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units, so the rate of increase is 18/8.
The second specimen increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units, so the rate of increase is 17/23.
The difference between these two rates is:
h = (18/8) - (17/23) = (18 × 23) / (8 × 23) - 17/23 = 414/184 - 17/23 = (414 - 136) / 184 = 278 / 184 = 139/92

**Indicator f:**
The final evidence factor f is the product of indicators h and i:
f = h × i = (139/92) × (221/75) = (139 × 221) / (92 × 75) = 30679 / 6900 = 4447/1150

Later in the same year, a lioness is pregnant again but this time her gestation period reduces by 15/20 of a year compared to the earlier total gestation period of both animals. How long will it take for the lioness to give birth this second time?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down into two parts:

Part 1: Find the total gestation period of both animals together.

The gestation period of a lioness is 20/22 of a year, which is equivalent to 20/22 = 0.90909 years (approximately).

The gestation period of a giraffe is 15 years.

The total gestation period of both animals together is 0.90909 + 15 = 15.90909 years.

Part 2: Find the reduced gestation period of the lioness for the second pregnancy.

The reduction in gestation period is 15/20 of a year, which is equivalent to 15/20 = 0.75 years.

The reduced gestation period of the lioness for the second pregnancy is the total gestation period of both animals together minus the reduction, which is:

15.90909 - 0.75 = 15.15909 years.

Now, we need to find the area of the similar rectangle, which is 18/17 times bigger than the original rectangle. We can multiply the area of the original rectangle by 18/17:

However, later that same day, they reduce the production by 19/24 of a tonne due to a sudden power cut. How many tonnes of soap does the factory produce that day after these adjustments?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator, which is 120. So, 23/8 = 345/120 and 4/20 = 24/120 and 19/24 = 95/120.

The factory produces 345/120 tonnes of soap initially.
Then, they increase production by 24/120 tonnes, making the total production 345/120 + 24/120 = 369/120 tonnes.
Later, they reduce production by 95/120 tonnes, making the total production 369/120 - 95/120 = 274/120 tonnes.

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 31. So, 274/120 = 274÷31 / 120÷31 = 8 26/30 = 8 26/30 = 8 13/15 tonnes.

Finally, the machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color, subtract that from 'd' to find 'x' in gallons, which is the total amount of paint. Find the value of 'x'.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The machine starts by mixing 24/8 gallons of red paint. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8. So, we get:

24/8 = 3 gallons of red paint initially.

2. The machine then pours away 12/8 gallons of the mix. Again, we can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. So, we get:

12/8 = 3/2 gallons of red paint poured away.

Now, let's find the amount of red paint left in the machine, which is represented by 'd':

d = 3 - 3/2 = 3/2 gallons of red paint left.

3. Finally, the machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color. We need to subtract this amount from 'd' to find 'x', which is the total amount of paint:

x = d - 1/28 = 3/2 - 1/28

To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 28. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

1. Sonia uses 21/12 oz of toothpaste daily. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

21 ÷ 3 = 7
12 ÷ 3 = 4

So, Sonia uses 7/4 oz of toothpaste daily.

2. Anthony uses 6/27 oz of toothpaste daily. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

6 ÷ 3 = 2
27 ÷ 3 = 9

So, Anthony uses 2/9 oz of toothpaste daily.

3. Now, let's add the amounts used by Sonia and Anthony:

7/4 + 2/9 = ?

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 36. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 36:

7/4 = 63/36
2/9 = 8/36

Now, we can add:

63/36 + 8/36 = 71/36

So, Sonia and Anthony use a total of 71/36 oz of toothpaste daily.

4. Their mom uses 3/18 oz of toothpaste daily. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

3 ÷ 3 = 1
18 ÷ 3 = 6

So, their mom uses 1/6 oz of toothpaste daily.

5. Finally, let's add the amount used by their mom to the total used by Sonia and Anthony:

71/36 + 1/6 = ?

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 36. So, we can convert the second fraction to have a denominator of 36:

1/6 = 6/36

Now, we can add:

71/36 + 6/36 = 77/36

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

1. Sonia still uses 21/12 oz of toothpaste daily. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

21 ÷ 3 = 7
12 ÷ 3 = 4

So, Sonia still uses 7/4 oz of toothpaste daily.

2. Anthony now uses 26/27 oz of toothpaste daily. This fraction is already in its simplest form.

3. Their mom still uses 3/18 oz of toothpaste daily. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

3 ÷ 3 = 1
18 ÷ 3 = 6

So, their mom still uses 1/6 oz of toothpaste daily.

4. Now, let's add the amounts used by Sonia, Anthony, and their mom:

7/4 + 26/27 + 1/6 = ?

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 108. So, we can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 108:

7/4 = 189/108
26/27 = 104/108
1/6 = 18/108

Now, we can add:

189/108 + 104/108 + 18/108 = 311/108

So, the new total daily toothpaste usage for Sonia, Anthony, and their mom is 311/108 oz.

        Let's suppose for a special recipe sandwich, you need to divide a wheel of cheese into 14 equal parts and a pickle jar into 18 equal parts. 

To make one special sandwich, you need 21 parts of the wheel of cheese and 7 parts from the pickle jar.

You've just made these sandwiches and you are down to ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of your original ingredients.

Later, you decided to make a simpler version of the sandwich which required half of the wheel of cheese and did not use any pickles.

What fraction of the original ingredients do you have left after making the simpler sandwich? Calculate the answer by subtracting (2 / 4) from the fraction you had after making the first sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

Initially, you had 1 whole wheel of cheese and 1 whole pickle jar, which means you had 1 (or 14/14) of the wheel of cheese and 1 (or 18/18) of the pickle jar.

After making the special sandwiches, you were left with:

((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of the original ingredients
= (7/18) + (3/2) (since 21/14 = 3/2)
= (7/18) + (27/18) (to have a common denominator)
= 34/18

Now, you make the simpler sandwich, which requires half of the wheel of cheese. Since you had 34/18 of the original ingredients, you had (34/18) × (14/14) = 34/18 of the wheel of cheese. Half of that is (34/18) × (1/2) = 17/18.

To find the fraction of the original ingredients left after making the simpler sandwich, subtract the fraction used (17/18) × (2/4) = 17/36 from the fraction you had after making the first sandwich:

34/18 - 17/36
= (68/36) - (17/36) (to have a common denominator)
= 51/36

        A window washer needs to clean two windows in a large building. The first window is 15/6 meters tall while the other one is 7/16 meters tall. How tall are the windows in total?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total height of the windows, we need to add the heights of the two windows. However, the heights are given in different units, so we need to find a common denominator to add them.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 16 is 48. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 48:

15/6 = (15*8)/(6*8) = 120/48
7/16 = (7*3)/(16*3) = 21/48

Now we can add the heights:

120/48 + 21/48 = 141/48

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3:

141 ÷ 3 = 47
48 ÷ 3 = 16

So, the total height of the windows is 47/16 meters.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's recalculate the total height of the windows with the corrected measurement.

The first window is 15/5 meters tall, and the second window is 7/16 meters tall. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 16 is 80. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 80:

15/5 = (15*16)/(5*16) = 240/80
7/16 = (7*5)/(16*5) = 35/80

Now we can add the heights:

240/80 + 35/80 = 275/80

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 5:

275 ÷ 5 = 55
80 ÷ 5 = 16

So, the total height of the windows is 55/16 meters.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add the apple and orange juice, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:

16/6 = 32/12
20/12 = 20/12

Now, we can add them:

32/12 + 20/12 = 52/12

To add the cranberry juice, we need to convert it to a fraction with a denominator of 12:

2/3 = 8/12

Now, we can add all three:

52/12 + 8/12 = 60/12

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 12:

60/12 = 5

So, Jan has 5 liters of juice in total.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Jeremy ordered 30/9 ounces of cheese. To find the total amount of cheese he requested, we can simplify the fraction:

30/9 = 10/3 = 3 1/3 ounces

Now, we can use the given equation to find the amount of cheese he actually received:

d = n - (17/22)

where n is the amount of cheese he requested, which is 3 1/3 ounces.

First, let's convert the mixed number to an improper fraction:

3 1/3 = 10/3

Now, plug in the values:

d = 10/3 - (17/22)

To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 22 is 66. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 66:

d = (220/66) - (51/66)

Now, subtract:

d = (220 - 51)/66
= 169/66

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

d = 169/66

So, Jeremy actually received 169/66 ounces of cheese.

First, let's simplify the fraction (30/18):

30/18 = 5/3

Now, multiply this fraction by d:

k = (5/3) * (169/66)

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down Sophia's calculations step by step:

1. In the first test, 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays, so the fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 13/4.
2. In the second test, 20 out of every 18 sunglasses blocked all UV rays, so the fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 20/18 = 10/9.
3. Sophia added these numbers to her total, so she added the fractions: 13/4 + 10/9 = (13*9 + 10*4) / (4*9) = 127/36.
4. Then, she added the additional 21 out of 17 sunglasses that also blocked all UV rays, so she added the fraction 21/17 to her total: 127/36 + 21/17 = (127*17 + 21*36) / (36*17) = 2531/612.
5. Later, she realized she made a mistake and needed to subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that actually did not block all UV rays, so she subtracted the fraction 16/30 from her total: 2531/612 - 16/30 = (2531*30 - 16*612) / (612*30) = 69149/18440.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1223:

1. To find the total amount of mayonnaise and sandwich spread Shawn uses to make a sandwich, we need to add the two fractions:

(23/28) + (6/9) = (23/28) + (16/24) = (69/84) + (48/84) = 117/84

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

117 ÷ 3 = 39
84 ÷ 3 = 28

So, the total amount of mayonnaise and sandwich spread Shawn uses to make a sandwich is 39/28 cups.

2. Now, Shawn adds 18/12 cups of cheese spread to his recipe. To find the total amount of ingredients Shawn needs to make one sandwich, we add the cheese spread to the total amount of mayonnaise and sandwich spread:

(39/28) + (18/12) = (39/28) + (42/28) = 81/28

3. Finally, if Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, we need to find the total number of cups of ingredients he will use. Let's say he makes x sandwiches. Then, the total amount of ingredients he will use is x times the total amount of ingredients per sandwich:

x × (81/28) = 4/4

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x × 81 = 4 × 28
x × 81 = 112
x = 112/81

To find the total number of cups of ingredients Shawn will use, we multiply the number of sandwiches by 4/4 cups per sandwich:

(112/81) × (4/4) = 112/81 cups

First, let's multiply the numerators:
22 × 22 = 484

Next, let's multiply the denominators:
25 × 8 = 200

Now, we can write the product as a fraction:

He had an additional 22/25 feet of length due to the fluffing of the pillow. The total length is then multiplied by 16/13 to account for overlap and corners. Calculate the length of border material James will need for his pillow.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the total length of the pillow. To do this, we add the length of the pillow to the additional length due to fluffing: 

(23/9) + (22/25) = ((23*25) + (22*9)) / (9*25) = (575 + 198) / 225 = 773 / 225 

Next, we multiply the total length by the factor to account for overlap and corners: 

(773 / 225) * (16 / 13) = (773 * 16) / (225 * 13) = 12368 / 2925 

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 41:

How many more miles was the car supposed to travel in total that day, given that it ran continuously at the same speed?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The car travels 21/4 miles every hour. To find the average miles it travels in an hour, we can leave the fraction as is, since it's already in miles per hour.

2. The car was needed to travel an extra 16/13 miles. To find out how many hours it would take to travel this distance, we can divide the extra distance by the average miles per hour:

(16/13) ÷ (21/4) = (16/13) × (4/21) = 64/273 hours

3. However, due to a detour, it only traveled an additional 1/21 miles. To find out how many hours it would take to travel this distance, we can divide the additional distance traveled by the average miles per hour:

(1/21) ÷ (21/4) = (1/21) × (4/21) = 4/441 hours

4. To find the difference in hours, subtract the actual hours traveled from the needed hours:

(64/273) - (4/441) = (256/1197) - (4/441) = (256-4)/1197 = 252/1197 hours

5. Since the car travels 21/4 miles per hour, we can multiply the difference in hours by the average miles per hour to find the difference in miles:

(252/1197) × (21/4) = (252 × 21) / (1197 × 4) = 5292 / 4796 = 33/29 miles

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The editing team takes 20/5 hours to edit a manuscript, which is equal to 4 hours.
2. The typesetting team needs 18/17 hours to adjust the layout of a page, which is approximately 1.06 hours (we'll use this value for calculation).
3. The total initial time required is the sum of the editing and typesetting times: 4 hours + 1.06 hours = 5.06 hours.
4. There is a collective loss of 6/15 hours, which is equal to 0.4 hours. So, the reduced time is: 5.06 hours - 0.4 hours = 4.66 hours.
5. To compensate, the manager extends the working hours by the same amount of time as the initial time span, which is 5.06 hours.
6. The total extended time is the sum of the reduced time and the extended time: 4.66 hours + 5.06 hours = 9.72 hours.
7. The problem asks for the product of the time required for the entire process and the extended time after the reduction of the lost hours with the initial total time required. This means we need to multiply the reduced time, the extended time, and the initial total time: 4.66 hours × 9.72 hours × 5.06 hours.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can simplify the fraction of gold used by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). 

The GCD of 21 and 28 is 7, so we can simplify the fraction as follows:
21/28 = 3/4

The amount of silver used remains the same:
13/26 = 1/2

Now, we can add the amounts of gold and silver used:
3/4 + 1/2 = 5/4

To convert the improper fraction to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:
5 ÷ 4 = 1 with a remainder of 1
So, the mixed number is 1 1/4

The total weight of gold and silver used by the jeweler is 1 1/4 kilograms.

        In a beehive, there are sections for honey storage and bee rearing. Each section is classified into many sub-sections. One day, the beekeeper discovered that each honey storage sub-section had (25 / 9) gallons of honey. He also found the same amount of honey in each bee rearing sub-section. 

If he combined the honey from both a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the beekeeper would have a total quantity represented by 'p'. 

However, one honey storage sub-section had an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey. So, if the beekeeper was calculating the total amount from this sub-section plus a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be defined as 's'. 

What quantity of honey ('s') would the beekeeper have in total from this scenario?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. Each honey storage sub-section has (25/9) gallons of honey.
2. Each bee rearing sub-section also has (25/9) gallons of honey.
3. If the beekeeper combines the honey from one honey storage sub-section and one bee rearing sub-section, the total quantity is 'p'. So, we can set up the equation:

p = (25/9) + (25/9)
p = 2(25/9)
p = 50/9

4. Now, one honey storage sub-section has an additional (2/26) gallons of honey. So, the total amount of honey in this sub-section is:

(25/9) + (2/26)

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 234. So, we can convert both fractions:

(25/9) = (575/234)
(2/26) = (18/234)

Now, we can add them:

(575/234) + (18/234) = (593/234)

5. If the beekeeper combines this honey storage sub-section with a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be 's'. So, we can set up the equation:

s = (593/234) + (25/9)

Again, we need to find a common denominator, which is 234. So, we can convert the second fraction:

(25/9) = (575/234)

Now, we can add them:

s = (593/234) + (575/234)
s = (1168/234)

        In prehistoric times, a herbivorous dinosaur eats 16/8 bunches of leaves per hour during the day. But at night, it only eats 6/17 bunches of leaves every hour because of reduced visibility. Calculate the total bunches of leaves the dinosaur eats in an hour if it is eating day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total bunches of leaves the dinosaur eats in an hour, we need to add the number of bunches it eats during the day and at night.

During the day, the dinosaur eats 16/8 bunches of leaves per hour. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8. This gives us:

16/8 = 2/1 = 2

So, the dinosaur eats 2 bunches of leaves per hour during the day.

At night, the dinosaur eats 6/17 bunches of leaves per hour.

To find the total bunches of leaves the dinosaur eats in an hour, we add the number of bunches it eats during the day and at night:

2 + 6/17 = 2 + 0.35294117647 (approximately) = 2.35294117647 (approximately)

        A bear ate 28/6 pounds of fish one day and 21/18 pounds the next day. On the third day, the bear ate 24/22 pounds of fish. How many total pounds of fish did the bear eat in these three days, written as a fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of fish eaten, we need to add the amounts eaten on each day. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 18, and 22 is 396. So, we can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 396:

28/6 = (28*66)/(6*66) = 1848/396
21/18 = (21*22)/(18*22) = 462/396
24/22 = (24*18)/(22*18) = 432/396

Now we can add the fractions:

1848/396 + 462/396 + 432/396 = 2742/396

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 6:

2742 ÷ 6 = 457
396 ÷ 6 = 66

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to recalculate the total amount of fish eaten with the new information.

The bear ate 28/6 pounds of fish on the first day, 5/18 pounds on the second day, and 24/22 pounds on the third day.

To find the total amount of fish eaten, we need to add the amounts eaten on each day. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 18, and 22 is 396. So, we can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 396:

28/6 = (28*66)/(6*66) = 1848/396
5/18 = (5*22)/(18*22) = 110/396
24/22 = (24*18)/(22*18) = 432/396

Now we can add the fractions:

1848/396 + 110/396 + 432/396 = 2390/396

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2:

2390 ÷ 2 = 1195
396 ÷ 2 = 198

So, the total amount of fish eaten is 1195/198 pounds.

So, the total amount of sugar required is 11/17 + 3 = 11/17 + 51/17 = 62/17 cups. 
Since Heather decided to increase the total quantity of sugar by a factor of 29/21, she used a total of (29/21) × (62/17) = 29 × 62 / (21 × 17) = 1798 / 357 cups of sugar.

        King Arthur is planning a grand feast at his castle. He estimates that each guest will consume 15/7 gallons of water and 15/24 gallons of wine. 

On the other hand, the royal baker needs 26/20 gallons of milk for each of the cakes he's baking.

Calculate the total amount of liquid (v) that will be consumed if the baker's requirement is multiplied by the guests' consumption (i), and then add this to the guests' consumption (v) to find the total amount of liquid (x) needed for the feast.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. The guests' consumption (v) is the sum of water and wine consumption:
v = 15/7 + 15/24
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 168. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:
v = 360/168 + 90/168
v = 450/168
v = 225/84

2. The royal baker's requirement is 26/20 gallons of milk per cake. Since we need to multiply this by the guests' consumption (v), we get:
i = (26/20) × (225/84)
i = 5850/1680
i = 225/64

3. Now, we need to add the guests' consumption (v) to the product of the baker's requirement and the guests' consumption (i):
x = v + i
x = 225/84 + 225/64
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 2688. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:
x = 675/2688 + 945/2688
x = 1620/2688

First, Teddy adds 30/17 and 18/15. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 255. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 255:

30/17 = (30*15)/(17*15) = 450/255

        Carlos is very handy, and he decided to start a business making and selling chairs. He usually makes each chair using 20/15 units of wood. For a special order, he decided to design a larger, sturdier chair that uses (24/5) times (7/6) units more wood than usual. 

In total, how many units of wood would Carlos need to make one of these special chairs? Please give your answer in simplest form.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. Carlos usually uses 20/15 units of wood for a regular chair. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

20/15 = (20 ÷ 5) / (15 ÷ 5) = 4/3

So, Carlos usually uses 4/3 units of wood for a regular chair.

2. For the special order, he needs (24/5) times (7/6) units more wood than usual. To multiply these fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately:

(24/5) × (7/6) = (24 × 7) / (5 × 6) = 168/30

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:

168/30 = (168 ÷ 6) / (30 ÷ 6) = 28/5

So, the special chair requires 28/5 units more wood than usual.

3. To find the total amount of wood needed for the special chair, we add the usual amount to the additional amount:

Total wood needed = Usual amount + Additional amount
= 4/3 + 28/5

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 15. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 15:

4/3 = (4 × 5) / (3 × 5) = 20/15
28/5 = (28 × 3) / (5 × 3) = 84/15

Now we can add:

Total wood needed = 20/15 + 84/15 = (20 + 84) / 15 = 104/15

        Carlos realized he could be using a more efficient design for his chairs. Instead of using 20/15 units of wood as he was previously, he can now use only 20/8 units for the basic chair design. The larger design with the special feature still requires (24/5) times (7/6) units more wood than the basic chair.

With this more efficient design for the basic chair, how many units of wood would Carlos now need in total to make one of these larger special design chairs? Please express your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. Carlos now uses 20/8 units of wood for a basic chair. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

20/8 = (20 ÷ 4) / (8 ÷ 4) = 5/2

So, Carlos now uses 5/2 units of wood for a basic chair.

2. The special design still requires (24/5) times (7/6) units more wood than the basic chair. We already simplified this fraction earlier:

(24/5) × (7/6) = 28/5

So, the special design requires 28/5 units more wood than the basic chair.

3. To find the total amount of wood needed for the special chair, we add the basic amount to the additional amount:

Total wood needed = Basic amount + Additional amount
= 5/2 + 28/5

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 10. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 10:

5/2 = (5 × 5) / (2 × 5) = 25/10
28/5 = (28 × 2) / (5 × 2) = 56/10

Now we can add:

Total wood needed = 25/10 + 56/10 = (25 + 56) / 10 = 81/10

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

Initially, the car's speed was 13/4 miles per minute.

The car slows down by 14/15 miles per minute, so we subtract this from the initial speed:
(13/4) - (14/15) = (195 - 56) / 60 = 139 / 60 miles per minute

Then, the car increases its speed again by 30/15 miles per minute, so we add this to the new speed:
(139/60) + (30/15) = (139 + 120) / 60 = 259 / 60 miles per minute

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:
259 / 60 = 259/60 miles per minute

(13/4) - (14/15) = (195 - 56) / 60 = 139 / 60 miles per minute

Then, the car increases its speed again by 19/15 miles per minute, so we add this to the new speed:
(139/60) + (19/15) = (139 + 76) / 60 = 215 / 60 miles per minute

- But Jake isn't the only one interested in these grapes. He has to share the grapes with others. He gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes. How many baskets of grapes does he get?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The vineyard can usually produce 19/2 baskets of grapes every season. However, due to weather conditions, only 19/29 of the usual amount were produced this season. To find out how many baskets were produced this season, we multiply the usual amount by the fraction of the usual amount produced:

(19/2) × (19/29) = (19 × 19) / (2 × 29) = 361 / 58 = 361/58

So, 361/58 baskets of grapes were produced this season.

2. Jake gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes. To find out how many baskets he gets, we multiply the total amount by the fraction he gets to keep:

(361/58) × (7/11) = (361 × 7) / (58 × 11) = 2527 / 638 = 2527/638

So, Jake gets 2527/638 baskets of grapes.

3. Out of the grapes that he got, Jake wants to make some grape juice. But he only uses 9/10 of his grapes to make the juice. To find out how many baskets he uses for the juice, we multiply the number of baskets he gets by the fraction he uses for juice:

(2527/638) × (9/10) = (2527 × 9) / (638 × 10) = 22743 / 6380 = 22743/6380

So, Jake uses 22743/6380 baskets of grapes for the juice.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The vineyard can produce 19/2 baskets of grapes in a season, and next season it produces 19/13 times its normal yield. To find out how many baskets it would produce next season, we multiply the normal yield by the improvement factor:

(19/2) × (19/13) = (19 × 19) / (2 × 13) = 361 / 26 = 361/26

So, the vineyard would produce 361/26 baskets of grapes next season.

2. Jake still gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes. To find out how many baskets he gets, we multiply the total amount by the fraction he gets to keep:

(361/26) × (7/11) = (361 × 7) / (26 × 11) = 2527 / 286 = 2527/286

So, Jake gets 2527/286 baskets of grapes.

3. Jake is still making grape juice, using 9/10 of his share of the grapes. To find out how many baskets he uses for grape juice making, we multiply the number of baskets he gets by the fraction he uses for juice:

(2527/286) × (9/10) = (2527 × 9) / (286 × 10) = 22743 / 2860 = 22743/2860

9/2 = 4.5 bushels of red grapes
10/22 = 0.45 bushels of green grapes (we can divide both numerator and denominator by 2 to get 5/11, but in this case, it's easier to convert to a decimal)

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total height of the snowman, we need to find the radius of each snowball and then add them together.

The diameter of the larger snowball is 17/8 feet, so the radius is half of that, which is (17/8) / 2 = 17/16 feet.

The diameter of the smaller snowball is 1/20 feet, so the radius is half of that, which is (1/20) / 2 = 1/40 feet.

Now, we add the radii of the two snowballs to find the total height: 17/16 + 1/40 = (17*5)/(16*5) + 1/40 = 85/80 + 1/40 = (85+1)/80 = 86/80 = 43/40 feet.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the total number of parts the sand is divided into. To do this, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 16, which is 112. So, the sand is divided into 112 parts.

The child splits the sand into 24/7 parts, which means each part is 112/(24/7) = 112/(24/7) = 49.

The other child takes away 2/16 part of the sand, which is equivalent to 2/16 × 112 = 14 parts.

So, the remaining part of the sand is 112 - 14 = 98 parts.

To find the fraction of the remaining sand, we divide the remaining parts by the total number of parts: 98/112 = 7/8.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To compare the amounts eaten, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 26 and 9 is 234. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 234:

28/26 = (28*9)/(26*9) = 252/234
23/9 = (23*26)/(9*26) = 598/234

Now we can subtract the two fractions:

598/234 - 252/234 = 346/234

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

23/9 - 28/26 = (23*26)/(9*26) - 28/26 = 598/234 - 252/234 = 346/234

Now, we need to find 21/4 as much as this difference:

(21/4) * (346/234) = (21*346)/(4*234) = 7236/936

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the expected number of bananas produced on a randomly chosen day, we can use the formula provided: ((12 / 29) + (30 / 10)).

First, let's calculate the number of bananas produced per day by each species:

 Species 1: 12 bananas every 29 days =&gt; 12/29 bananas per day
 Species 2: 30 bananas every 10 days =&gt; 30/10 = 3 bananas per day

Now, let's add the number of bananas produced per day by both species:

(12/29) + 3 = (12/29) + (30/10) = (12/29) + 3 = (12/29) + (3*29/29) = (12+87)/29 = 99/29

Now, we need to find the square of u, which represents the new expected total number of bananas produced per day:

(u * u) = (99/29) * (99/29) = (99 * 99) / (29 * 29) = 9801 / 841

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total ton of food the giraffe needs to eat in a day, we need to add the ton of acacia leaves and the ton of grasses.

First, let's simplify the fractions:
11/11 = 1 (since 11 divided by 11 is 1)
26/14 = 13/7 (since 26 divided by 14 is 13/7)

Now, we can add the two fractions:
1 + 13/7 = 20/7 (since 1 is equal to 7/7, and 7/7 + 13/7 = 20/7)

So, the total ton of food the giraffe needs to eat in a day is 20/7 ton.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found the total ton of food the giraffe needs to eat in a day, which is 20/7 ton. Now, we need to add the ton of water the giraffe drinks per day.

First, let's simplify the fraction of water:
10/30 = 1/3 (since 10 divided by 30 is 1/3)

Now, we can add the ton of food and water:
20/7 + 1/3 = ?

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 21. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 21:
20/7 = 60/21
1/3 = 7/21

Now, we can add:
60/21 + 7/21 = 67/21

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The giraffe still needs to eat 11/11 ton of acacia leaves, which is equal to 1 ton.

The giraffe now eats 24/14 ton of grasses. To add this to the ton of acacia leaves, we need to find a common denominator, which is 14. So, we can rewrite 1 ton as 14/14 ton.

Now, we can add the two fractions:
14/14 + 24/14 = 38/14

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
38 ÷ 2 = 19
14 ÷ 2 = 7

So, the total ton of food the giraffe eats per day is 19/7 ton.

Assume that the bear has a regular sleeping pattern. Calculate the fraction of time the bear has spent sleeping over the 27 days assuming each month has 13 weeks. Your answer should be the result of (18 / 24) * (27 / 13). Write your answer as a decimal.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The bear spends 18/24 of each day asleep, which is equivalent to 0.75 (since 18/24 = 3/4 = 0.75).

Over 27 days, the bear spends 0.75 × 27 days asleep.

To find the fraction of time the bear has spent sleeping over the 27 days, we need to divide the total time spent sleeping by the total time available (27 days).

There are 13 weeks in a month, and each week has 7 days, so there are 13 × 7 = 91 days in a month.

The total time available is 27 days, which is 27/91 of the total time in a month.

Now, we can calculate the fraction of time the bear has spent sleeping:

(18/24) × (27/91) = (3/4) × (27/91) = 0.75 × (27/91) ≈ 0.225

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To evaluate the expression (14 / 2) / (23 / 17), we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS). First, we calculate the expressions inside the parentheses:

(14 / 2) = 7
(23 / 17) = 23/17

Now, we can rewrite the expression as:
7 / (23/17)

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:
7 × (17/23) = (7 × 17) / 23 = 119 / 23

So, the Zogorian's initial energy level is 119/23 zogs.

Later, his energy level increases by (16 / 24) zogs. Again, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
(16 / 24) = 2/3

Now, we add the increase to the initial energy level:
(119/23) + (2/3)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 69. We can rewrite the fractions as:
(483/69) + (46/69) = (483 + 46)/69 = 529/69

The number of friends Teddy hides at the beach is 8/21 of x, which is (8/21)x.

The difference between the number of friends Teddy hides in the forest and at the beach is:

f = ((18/11)x - (8/21)x)

To simplify this expression, we can find a common denominator, which is 231. Then:

f = ((378x - 88x)/231)
f = (290x/231)

n = f^2
n = ((290x/231))^2
n = (84100x^2)/53241

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't simplify this expression further. However, we can express n in terms of x:

What is their total distance in meters 1 hour after all three have started moving? Compute the result using the operation ((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) for the first two snails' distance, and multiply this result by (18 / 17) for the total distance , including the third snail.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The first snail covers 17/21 of a meter in an hour. Since it started an hour earlier, it has already covered 17/21 meters when the other two snails start moving.
2. The second snail covers 20/24 of a meter in an hour. After 1 hour, it will cover 20/24 meters.
3. The third snail covers 18/17 of a meter in an hour. After 1 hour, it will cover 18/17 meters.
4. To find the total distance covered by the first two snails, we add their distances: (17/21) + (20/24) = (408 + 350) / (504) = 758 / 504.
5. To find the total distance covered by all three snails, we multiply the result by the distance covered by the third snail: (758 / 504) × (18 / 17) = 13644 / 8512.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of cat food eaten in one day, we need to add the amount eaten in the morning and the evening.

In the morning, the cat eats 16/12 of a can, which is equivalent to 4/3 of a can (since 16/12 = 4/3).

In the evening, the cat eats 6/10 of a can.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 30. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 30:

        A monkey finds a pile of bananas and ends up eating (22 / 7) times (10 / 25) of the pile. Later, he gives (3 / 28) of the pile to his friend. How much of the pile does the monkey have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The monkey eats (22/7) × (10/25) of the pile. To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (22 × 10 = 220) and multiply the denominators (7 × 25 = 175), then simplify:

(220/175) = (4/1) = 4

So, the monkey eats 4 times the original pile.

2. Since the monkey eats 4 times the original pile, that means he eats 4/1 of the pile. To find the fraction of the pile left, we subtract this from 1:

1 - (4/1) = 1 - 4 = -3 (but we can't have a negative amount, so we'll rewrite this as)

1 - 4/1 = 1/1 - 4/1 = (-3)/1 = -3/1

To get a positive fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by -1:

(-3)/1 = 3/-1 = (-3)/1 × (-1)/(-1) = 3/(-1) × (-1)/(-1) = 3/1

So, the monkey has -3/1 of the pile left, which means he has eaten the entire pile and has 3 times the original pile more to eat (but that's not possible, so let's re-evaluate).

3. Let's rethink this: the monkey eats 4 times the original pile, which means he eats the entire pile and has 3 times the original pile more to eat (but that's not possible). This means our initial calculation was incorrect.

Let's retry:

The monkey eats (22/7) × (10/25) of the pile. To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (22 × 10 = 220) and multiply the denominators (7 × 25 = 175), then simplify:

(220/175) = (4/1) = 4/1

So, the monkey eats 4/1 of the pile.

To find the fraction of the pile left, we subtract this from 1:

1 - (4/1) = 1 - 4 = -3 (but we can't have a negative amount, so we'll rewrite this as)

1 - 4/1 = 1/1 - 4/1 = (-3)/1 = -3/1

To get a positive fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by -1:

(-3)/1 = 3/-1 = (-3)/1 × (-1)/(-1) = 3/(-1) × (-1)/(-1) = 3/1

Wait, this still doesn't make sense! Let's retry again:

The monkey eats (22/7) × (10/25) of the pile. To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (22 × 10 = 220) and multiply the denominators (7 × 25 = 175), then simplify:

(220/175) = (4/5)

So, the monkey eats 4/5 of the pile.

To find the fraction of the pile left, we subtract this from 1:

1 - (4/5) = (5/5) - (4/5) = (1/5)

The monkey has 1/5 of the pile left.

4. Later, he gives (3/28) of the pile to his friend. To find the fraction of the pile left, we subtract this from the fraction he had left:

(1/5) - (3/28)

To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 140. So, we convert both fractions:

(1/5) = (28/140)
(3/28) = (15/140)

Now we can subtract:

(28/140) - (15/140) = (13/140)

The monkey has 13/140 of the pile left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of ounces consumed initially. Since each glass contains 29/9 ounces and 26/25 of them were consumed, we can multiply the number of glasses consumed by the number of ounces per glass:

(26/25) × (29/9) = (26 × 29) / (25 × 9) = 754 / 225 = 3.36 (approximately)

So, approximately 3.36 ounces of beverage were consumed initially.

Next, the partygoers drink an additional 2/19 ounces of beverages. To find the total number of ounces consumed, we add the initial amount to the additional amount:

3.36 + (2/19) = 3.36 + 0.105 = 3.465

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. You add 7/15 of a new set of toothbrushes to your current collection. This means you now have 1 + 7/15 = 22/15 sets of toothbrushes.

3. You can only fit 26/27 of them in your display case. To find out how many sets you can fit, multiply the total number of sets by 26/27:

(157/15) × (26/27) = 157 × 26 / (15 × 27) = 4072 / 405 = 10.06 (approximately)

        Joan has a backpack which weighs 27/20 kilograms when it's empty. She adds a book which weighs 1/6 kilograms. Calculate the total weight of the backpack in kilograms now. Please write the answer as a simplified fraction.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total weight of the backpack, we need to add the weight of the empty backpack and the weight of the book.

The weight of the empty backpack is 27/20 kilograms.
The weight of the book is 1/6 kilograms.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 60. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 60:

27/20 = (27*3)/(20*3) = 81/60
1/6 = (1*10)/(6*10) = 10/60

Now we can add the fractions:

81/60 + 10/60 = 91/60

So, the total weight of the backpack is 91/60 kilograms.

### Answer: 91/60</pre>

        Let's revise our original situation. This time, Joan's backpack weighs 27/20 kilograms when it's empty. She then adds a heavier book which weighs 21/6 kilograms. What's the total weight of her backpack now? Please write your answer as a simplified fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total weight of the backpack, we need to add the weight of the empty backpack and the weight of the book.

The weight of the empty backpack is 27/20 kilograms.
The weight of the book is 21/6 kilograms.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 60. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 60:

27/20 = (27*3)/(20*3) = 81/60
21/6 = (21*10)/(6*10) = 210/60

Now we can add the fractions:

81/60 + 210/60 = 291/60

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

291 ÷ 3 = 97
60 ÷ 3 = 20

So, the total weight of the backpack is 97/20 kilograms.

First, simplify the fraction (7 / 7) = 1, since 7 divided by 7 is 1.

Now, multiply 1 by (25 / 22) = 1 * (25 / 22) = 25 / 22.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that the previous size change had a multiplier of 25/22. Now, the company is further increasing the size by a multiplier of 28/13.

To find the new multiplier, we need to multiply the previous multiplier by the new multiplier:

(25/22) × (28/13) = ?

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (numbers on top) and multiply the denominators (numbers on the bottom), like this:

(25 × 28) / (22 × 13) = 700 / 286

So, the new multiplier of the updated bottle compared to the original one is 700/286.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

1. Tilly has 25/9 kg of sea plants initially.
2. She finds 8/13 kg more, so she now has:
25/9 + 8/13 = (25*13 + 8*9) / (9*13) = (325 + 72) / 117 = 397 / 117 kg
3. She finds another 24/27 kg, so she now has:
397/117 + 24/27 = (397*27 + 24*117) / (117*27) = (10689 + 2788) / 3159 = 13477 / 3159 kg
4. Finally, she finds 21/26 kg more, so she now has:
13477/3159 + 21/26 = (13477*26 + 21*3159) / (3159*26) = (350522 + 66219) / 82234 = 416741 / 82234 kg

To simplify the fraction, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 416741 and 82234, which is 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form:

        Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down Captain Alf's calculations step by step:

1. Calculate the difference in his current location and the distance of the nearby island:

Distance to the island = 17/2 nautical miles
Current location = 4/2 nautical miles away from the island
Difference = 17/2 - 4/2 = (17 - 4)/2 = 13/2 nautical miles

2. Adjust for the tide:

Tide adjustment = 14/9 nautical miles
Adjusted distance = 13/2 + 14/9 = (13*9 + 14*2)/(2*9) = (117 + 28)/18 = 145/18 nautical miles

3. Calculate fuel requirements based on fuel efficiency:

Fuel efficiency = 22/15 nautical miles per gallon
Fuel requirements = Adjusted distance × Fuel efficiency = (145/18) × (22/15) = (145*22)/(18*15) = 3190/270 nautical miles per gallon

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:

        Callie owns a pen business. Last month, she sold 20 pens for every 15 she produced. At the same time, she sold an additional 16 pens for every 22 she put out for sale. 

Meanwhile, she found that for every 22 pens she advertised, 27 were interested customers. For each 23 pens she produced this week, she was able to sell 8. 

What is the result when she multiplies the ratio of last month's sales to production (20/15 + 16/22) and this week's figure for the ratio of interested customers to production (22/27 * 23/8)? Leave your answer as an unsimplified fraction.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step:

Last month's sales to production ratio:
(20/15) + (16/22) = (4/3) + (8/11) = (44/33) + (24/33) = (68/33)

This week's ratio of interested customers to production:
(22/27) × (23/8) = (22 × 23) / (27 × 8) = (506) / (216)

Now, let's multiply the two ratios:
(68/33) × (506/216) = (68 × 506) / (33 × 216) = (34568) / (7128)

        Consider a band practice session in which a musician played a song for exactly 30 minutes. After dividing this time equally between 15 songs, how much time did they spend on each song? From this average time per song, the band reduced the time spent on a particular song by 1/17 of an hour. Can you calculate the final duration of that song?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The musician played a song for 30 minutes, and divided this time equally between 15 songs. To find the time spent on each song, we can divide 30 minutes by 15:

30 minutes ÷ 15 = 2 minutes per song

The band reduced the time spent on a particular song by 1/17 of an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1/17 of an hour is:

(1/17) × 60 = 60/17 = 3.53 minutes (approximately)

So, the band reduced the time spent on the particular song by 3.53 minutes. To find the final duration of that song, we subtract this reduction from the average time per song:

2 minutes - 3.53 minutes = -1.53 minutes

Since we can't have a negative time, we'll assume the reduction is 3 minutes and 32 seconds (approximately equal to 3.53 minutes). Therefore, the final duration of that song is:

2 minutes - 3 minutes 32 seconds = 28 seconds

Later that afternoon, his friend Jack also rented a scooter and rode it for 7/17 of an hour. 

How many hours did they both ride scooters in total (expressed as a fraction)? Combine the hours they both rode and simplify the fraction to get the answer.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

Josh rode the scooter for 18 hours on the first day.
On the second day, he rode for an additional 1/12 of an hour, so the total hours he rode is:
18 + 1/12 = 18 1/12 = 217/12 hours

Jack rode his scooter for 7/17 of an hour.

To find the total hours they both rode, we add the hours:
(217/12) + (7/17)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 204 (the least common multiple of 12 and 17). So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 204:

(217/12) = (578/204)
(7/17) = (84/204)

Now we can add:
(578/204) + (84/204) = (662/204)

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
(662/204) = (331/102)

The least common multiple (LCM) of 26, 11, 28, and 19 is 15148. So, we can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 15148:

Floor lamps: 4/26 = (4*582)/15148 = 2328/15148
Desk lamps: 15/11 = (15*1376)/15148 = 20640/15148
Table lamps: 23/28 = (23*542)/15148 = 12586/15148
Decorative lamps: 8/19 = (8*796)/15148 = 6368/15148

Now, we can add these fractions:

(2328 + 20640 + 12586 + 6368)/15148 = 39922/15148

        In a snow fight, Mike threw 9/19 of his snowballs and his friend, John threw 6/8 of his snowballs. After a while, Mike found 4 more snowballs to throw.

The question is, if 'u' represents the number of snowballs thrown by both Mike and John and 'j' is the total number of snowballs Mike had after finding more, how many snowballs did Mike have in total?

Solve the following equations to find the variable 'j':

u = 9/19 + 6/8

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step!

First, we need to find the value of 'u'. To do that, we'll simplify the expression:

u = 9/19 + 6/8

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 152. So, we'll convert both fractions:

u = (36/152) + (93/152)
u = 129/152

Now, we'll move on to the second equation:

j = u + 4/1

Substitute the value of 'u' we just found:

j = 129/152 + 4/1

To add these fractions, we'll convert the whole number 4 to a fraction with a denominator of 152:

j = 129/152 + 608/152
j = 737/152

Worker 1 packages 26 pieces of chocolate in 18 minutes, so the rate at which they package chocolate is:

To find the rate per minute, we can divide by 18:

26/18 = 13/9 pieces per minute

Worker 2 packages 15 pieces of chocolate every 15 minutes, so the rate at which they package chocolate is:

15 pieces / 15 minutes = 15/15 pieces per minute

To find the rate per minute, we can divide by 15:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's re-analyze the situation:

Worker 1 still packages 26 pieces of chocolate in 18 minutes, so their rate remains the same:

26 pieces / 18 minutes = 26/18 pieces per minute

To find the rate per minute, we can divide by 18:

26/18 = 13/9 pieces per minute

Worker 2 now packages 14 pieces of chocolate every 15 minutes, so their rate is:

14 pieces / 15 minutes = 14/15 pieces per minute

To find the rate per minute, we can divide by 15:

14/15 = 14/15 pieces per minute

Now, let's add the rates of both workers to find the total amount of chocolate they can package in one minute:

13/9 pieces/minute + 14/15 pieces/minute = (195/135 + 126/135) pieces/minute = 321/135 pieces/minute

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The first recipe requires (27 / 3) cups flour, which is 9 cups of flour.
2. The first recipe requires (11 / 7) cups sugar, which is approximately 1.57 cups of sugar.
3. The ratio of flour to sugar is 9 / 1.57, which is approximately 5.73.
4. Subtracting (21 / 26) from this ratio gives 5.73 - 0.81, which is approximately 4.92.
5. Adding (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to this ratio gives 4.92 + 2.44, which is approximately 7.36.

However, since we're looking for the total cups of flour, we need to add the original 9 cups of flour from the first recipe to the 2.44 cups of flour from the second recipe. This gives:

9 + 2.44 = 11.44

After a week, the number of chickens multiplied by 19/21 due to new chickens born. How many chickens are there now in Farmer John's farm?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the total number of chickens initially. To do this, we need to find the difference between the number of chickens in the two farms.

The number of chickens in the first farm is 26/13. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 13. This gives us 2 chickens in the first farm.

The number of chickens in the second farm is 9/16. This fraction is already in its simplest form.

To find the difference, we need to subtract the number of chickens in the second farm from the number of chickens in the first farm. However, since we want to find the total number of chickens, we will add the number of chickens in both farms instead.

The total number of chickens initially is 2 + 9/16 = 2 + 0.5625 = 2.5625.

After a week, the number of chickens multiplied by 19/21. To find the total number of chickens now, we multiply the initial total by 19/21.

The total number of chickens now is 2.5625 × 19/21 = 2.5625 × 0.90476 = 2.317.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a chicken, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 2 chickens now in Farmer John's farm.

        A helicopter traveled a distance of 24/14 miles for a training exercise. During a second exercise, the helicopter flew the same distance. If we let 'w' be the distance flown for each exercise and 't' be the total distance flown for both exercises represented as the product of 'w' times 'w', what is the value of 't'?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the helicopter flew the same distance for both exercises, we can represent the total distance flown as the product of 'w' times 'w', which is w × w = w².

We are given that the distance flown for each exercise is w = 24/14 miles. To find the total distance flown, we substitute this value into the expression w²:

t = w²
= (24/14)²
= (24/14) × (24/14)
= (24 × 24) / (14 × 14)
= 576 / 196
= 36/49

        A UFO has made two fuel stops. During the first refuel, the UFO was able to fill 20/16 of its fuel tank. At the second fuel stop, the UFO filled another 24/25 of its tank. Calculate the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill, we need to add the fractions from the two fuel stops.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 25 is 400. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 400:

20/16 = (20 x 25) / (16 x 25) = 500/400
24/25 = (24 x 16) / (25 x 16) = 384/400

Now we can add the fractions:

(500/400) + (384/400) = (500 + 384) / 400 = 884/400

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 4:

884 ÷ 4 = 221
400 ÷ 4 = 100

So, the simplified fraction is:

221/100

First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 25 is 400. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 400:

24/25 = (24 x 16) / (25 x 16) = 384/400

Now we can add the fractions:

(750/400) + (384/400) = (750 + 384) / 400 = 1134/400

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 4:

1134 ÷ 4 = 283.5
400 ÷ 4 = 100

        Professor Astro is working on his telescope. He believes the power of his telescope is directly proportional to the sum of two fractions. The first fraction is the light gathering power of the lens, which is 24 out of 27. The second fraction is the zooming potential, which is 30 out of 26. So, Professor Astro calculates the sum of these two fractions ((24 / 27) + (30 / 26)). What does he find?

(30/26) = (30*27)/(26*27) = 810/702

Now, we can add the two fractions:

(624/702) + (810/702) = (624 + 810)/702 = 1434/702

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Kiki ate 11/6 bananas in the morning and the same amount in the afternoon, so she ate a total of 11/6 + 11/6 bananas.

To add these fractions, we need to have the same denominator, which is 6. So, we can add the numerators (11 + 11) and keep the same denominator:

(11 + 11)/6 = 22/6

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

        Jaden is a dairy farmer who milks his cows twice a day. In the morning, his cows give him 26/14 gallons of milk per cow, and in the evening, they give 28/20 gallons of milk per cow. If he multiplies these two fractions together, how much milk is he getting from one cow in one day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total amount of milk Jaden gets from one cow in one day, we need to multiply the morning and evening milk production fractions.

Morning milk production: 26/14 gallons/cow
Evening milk production: 28/20 gallons/cow

To multiply these fractions, we multiply the numerators (26 and 28) and multiply the denominators (14 and 20), then write the product as a fraction:

(26 × 28) / (14 × 20) = 728 / 280

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 28:

728 ÷ 28 = 26
280 ÷ 28 = 10

So, the simplified fraction is:

26/10 = 2.6 gallons/cow/day
