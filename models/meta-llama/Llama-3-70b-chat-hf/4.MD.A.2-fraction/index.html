        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Steve spent 38 dollars over 8 days, so he spent 38/8 = 4.75 dollars per day.
John spent the same amount of money as Steve had, so John spent 38 dollars.
John started with 18 dollars and spent 38 dollars, so he had 18 - 38 = -20 dollars.
Then, John found 25 dollars on the street, so he now has -20 + 25 = 5 dollars.

            Sally wants to measure the distance of her bike route. Initially, she hesitates and travels only 47/50 of a mile. Then, she gains confidence and rides another 31 miles. Every day for the next 28 days, she completes the same distance.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Initially, Sally travels 47/50 = 0.94 miles.
Then, she rides another 31 miles, making a total of 0.94 + 31 = 31.94 miles.
Every day for the next 28 days, she completes the same distance, which is 31.94 miles.
So, in total, she travels 31.94 miles/day * 29 days (including the initial day) = 31.94 * 29 = 926.26 miles.
On one day, she adds an extra 32/24 = 1.33 miles to her regular bike route.
So, the total distance traveled is 926.26 + 1.33 = 927.59 miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The truck can travel a distance of 34/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel. To find the total distance it can travel, we need to know how many liters of fuel it has. Let's assume it has 1 liter of fuel. Then, the total distance it can travel is 34/25 kilometers.

2. If 11 more kilometers are added to its journey, the new total distance would be:
(34/25) + 11 = (34/25) + (275/25) = (309/25) kilometers

3. Now, if an additional 49 kilometers are added to the journey, the new total distance would be:
(309/25) + 49 = (309/25) + (1225/25) = (1534/25) kilometers

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's first find John's jogging speed after consuming the energy drink. His original speed was 4/22 miles per hour. The energy drink increased his speed by 50/49 miles per hour, so his new speed is:

(4/22) + (50/49) = (92 + 1100) / (22 * 49) = 1192 / 1078 miles per hour

To find the distance he would jog in 46/30 hours, we multiply his speed by the time:

(1192 / 1078) * (46 / 30) = 1192 * 46 / (1078 * 30) = 25192 / 32340 miles

            A truck driver starts his route with 9 gallons of gas in his tank. He stops at a station and adds to this tank another 21/36 gallons of gas. Later, he stops at another station and adds another 26/42 gallons of gas. How many gallons of gas total does the truck driver have now in his tank?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 21/36 and 26/42. The least common multiple of 36 and 42 is 252. So, we can convert the fractions to have a denominator of 252:

21/36 = (21*7)/(36*7) = 147/252
26/42 = (26*6)/(42*6) = 156/252

Now, we can add the fractions:

147/252 + 156/252 = 303/252

The truck driver starts with 9 gallons of gas and adds 303/252 gallons. To add these, we need to convert 9 to an improper fraction:

9 = 9*252/252 = 2268/252

Now, we can add:

2268/252 + 303/252 = 2571/252

To simplify, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 21:

2571 Ã· 21 = 122
252 Ã· 21 = 12

So, the truck driver has 122/12 gallons of gas. We can simplify this further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

122 Ã· 2 = 61
12 Ã· 2 = 6

The truck driver has 61/6 gallons of gas. To convert this to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator by the denominator:

61 Ã· 6 = 10 with a remainder of 1

So, the truck driver has 10 1/6 gallons of gas.

They received an additional $19/11, which is a fraction of a dollar. To convert this to a whole number of dollars, we can multiply by 11 (the denominator) to get $19. Then, we divide by 11 to get the decimal equivalent: $19 Ã· 11 = $1.727272... (approximately).
We can add this amount to the bank's previous total: $40 + $1.727272... â‰ˆ $41.727272...

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. John needs to save $40 - $29 = $11 to buy the video game.
2. Every week, John saves 20/48 of the money he needs, which is 20/48 Ã— $11 = $4.58 per week.
3. To find out how many weeks it takes John to save the remaining $11, we can divide $11 by $4.58, which gives us approximately 2.4 weeks. So, John will save $11 in approximately 2.4 weeks.
4. After 2.4 weeks, John will have saved a total of $29 (initial amount) + $11 (saved amount) = $40.
5. John invests the entire $40 in the investment account, which promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested after a year.
6. The return on investment is 41/11 Ã— $40 = $150.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's convert the initial amount of money Maria has to a fraction with a denominator of 15, so we can subtract the cost of the candy bar: 36/3 = (36*5)/(3*5) = 180/15 euros.

Now, we can subtract the cost of the candy bar: 180/15 - 32/15 = (180 - 32)/15 = 148/15 euros.

            A sprinter runs two sections of a race. The first part is run at a speed of 34 miles per 14 hours, and the second part is run at a speed of 21 miles per 26 hours. How much distance does the sprinter cover in one hour from both parts together?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

Part 1: The sprinter runs at a speed of 34 miles per 14 hours. To find the speed in miles per hour, we can divide 34 miles by 14 hours:

34 miles Ã· 14 hours = 2.43 miles per hour (approximately)

Part 2: The sprinter runs at a speed of 21 miles per 26 hours. To find the speed in miles per hour, we can divide 21 miles by 26 hours:

21 miles Ã· 26 hours = 0.81 miles per hour (approximately)

To find the total distance covered in one hour, we add the speeds from both parts:

2.43 miles/hour + 0.81 miles/hour = 3.24 miles/hour

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the distance Jenny traveled at the original speed. We can do this by multiplying the speed by the time: 

Distance = Speed Ã— Time = (32/24) Ã— 29 = 32 Ã— 29 / 24 = 37.67 miles (approximately)

Now, if her speed increases by a factor of 43/15, her new speed will be:

New Speed = (32/24) Ã— (43/15) = 32 Ã— 43 / (24 Ã— 15) = 64/24 miles per hour

To find the new distance, we can multiply the new speed by the same time:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance Tom moved the rocks, we need to find the total time he moved the rocks and then multiply it by his speed.

First, let's convert the time intervals to a common denominator, which is 100. So, the first rock was moved for 40/100 hours, and the second rock was moved for 125/100 hours.

Now, we can add the time intervals: 40/100 + 125/100 = 165/100 hours.

Next, we can multiply the total time by Tom's speed: (165/100) Ã— (25/22) = 4125/2200 miles.

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 25: 4125 Ã· 25 = 165, and 2200 Ã· 25 = 88.

So, the total distance Tom moved the rocks is 165/88 miles.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's recalculate the total time Tom spent moving the rocks.

The first rock was moved for 20/50 hours, which is equivalent to 40/100 hours.

The second rock was moved for 45/9 hours, which is equivalent to 500/100 hours.

Now, we can add the time intervals: 40/100 + 500/100 = 540/100 hours.

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 20: 540 Ã· 20 = 27, and 100 Ã· 20 = 5.

So, the total time Tom spent moving the rocks is 27/5 hours.

Next, we can multiply the total time by Tom's speed: (27/5) Ã— (25/22) = 675/110 miles.

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5: 675 Ã· 5 = 135, and 110 Ã· 5 = 22.

So, the total distance Tom moved the rocks is 135/22 miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. The scientist mixes 10/42 liters of solution A and 32 liters of solution B. To add these, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 42 and 28 is 84. So, we can convert 10/42 to 20/84 and 4/28 to 12/84. Now, we can add:

20/84 + 32 = 20/84 + 2688/84 = 2708/84 liters

2. She then removes 4/28 liters from this mixture. Again, we need to find a common denominator, which is 84. So, we can convert 4/28 to 12/84. Now, we can subtract:

2708/84 - 12/84 = 2696/84 liters

3. She then decides to extract 11/29 of the remaining mixture for an experiment. To find 11/29 of 2696/84, we can multiply:

(11/29) Ã— (2696/84) = 32356/2436 liters

How much space is left in the bottle after subtracting 11/19 gallon which was drunk by a customer?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. First, we need to find the total amount of juice in the two containers. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 35 and 41 is 1435. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1435:

(23/35) = (943/1435)
(50/41) = (1225/1435)

Now, we can add the two fractions:

(943/1435) + (1225/1435) = (2168/1435)

So, the total amount of juice is 2168/1435 gallons.

2. Next, we need to convert this fraction to a decimal to make it easier to work with:

2168/1435 â‰ˆ 1.51 gallons

Since the bottle can hold 28 gallons, we subtract the total amount of juice from the capacity of the bottle:

28 - 1.51 â‰ˆ 26.49 gallons

This means the bottle can hold approximately 26.49 gallons of juice.

3. Finally, we need to subtract the amount of juice drunk by the customer from the remaining amount:

26.49 - 11/19 â‰ˆ 26.49 - 0.58 â‰ˆ 25.91 gallons

So, there are approximately 25.91 gallons of space left in the bottle.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total distance Ann runs in a day, we need to add the distances she runs in the morning and evening. 

First, let's simplify the fractions: 
43/18 = 2 7/18 (morning) 
22/9 = 2 4/9 (evening) 

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 18. So, we can convert 2 4/9 to 2 8/18. 

Now, we can add: 
2 7/18 + 2 8/18 = 4 15/18 

To convert this mixed number to an improper fraction, we multiply the whole number part (4) by the denominator (18) and add the numerator (15): 
4 Ã— 18 + 15 = 87 

So, the total distance Ann runs in a day is 87/18 kilometers.

To find out how many more kilometers Ann needs to run to meet her daily goal of 20 kilometers, we can subtract the total distance she runs from her daily goal:

20 - 87/18

To subtract a fraction from a whole number, we need to convert the whole number to a fraction with a denominator of 18:
20 = 360/18

Now, we can subtract:
360/18 - 87/18 = 273/18

To convert this improper fraction to a mixed number, we divide the numerator (273) by the denominator (18):
273 Ã· 18 = 15 with a remainder of 3

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find the total amount of money Alex has after picking up the money on the floor. To do this, we add the two fractions:

$13/10 + $47/36 = $(13*36 + 47*10) / (10*36) = $(468 + 470) / 360 = $938 / 360

Now, we simplify the fraction:

$938 / 360 = $2.43 (approximately)

Next, we duplicate the amount of money Alex has by 43 times:

$2.43 Ã— 43 = $104.49

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Richard drank 33/48 of the wine, which is equivalent to (33/48) Ã— 33 = 22.125 ounces.

The cup of orange juice contained 26/30 of a liter, which is equivalent to (26/30) Ã— 1000 = 866.67 milliliters (since 1 liter = 1000 milliliters). To convert this to ounces, we multiply by 33.81 (since 1 milliliter â‰ˆ 0.03381 ounces), which gives us approximately 29.33 ounces.

The bottle of water contained 2/36 of a liter, which is equivalent to (2/36) Ã— 1000 = 55.56 milliliters. Converting this to ounces, we get approximately 1.87 ounces.

The total volume of liquid consumed is the sum of these values: 22.125 + 29.33 + 1.87 = 53.32 ounces.

            John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days. He began noticing that his apples lasts about as long as 48 ounces of apple juice, which he happens to consume every 42 days. Calculate the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days, so his rate of apple consumption is:

17 pounds / 8 days = 17/8 pounds/day

To find the rate in ounces, we can convert pounds to ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces):

(17/8) Ã— 16 = 34 ounces/day

2. John consumes 48 ounces of apple juice every 42 days, so his rate of apple juice consumption is:

48 ounces / 42 days = 48/42 ounces/day

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by 6:

48/42 = 8/7 ounces/day

3. Now, we can find the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption by dividing his rate of apple consumption by his rate of apple juice consumption:

(34 ounces/day) / (8/7 ounces/day) = 34 Ã— (7/8) = 29.75

So, John consumes approximately 29.75 times as many ounces of apples as ounces of apple juice.

So, the total miles Maria drove is 8 * (4/7) = 32/7 = 4 4/7 miles.

Maria initially had 38 dollars for gas but spent 50/4 = 12.5 dollars on gas. 
So, the remaining amount of money she had for gas is 38 - 12.5 = 25.5 dollars.

The summation of the total miles Maria drove and the remaining amount of money she had for gas is 4 4/7 + 25.5 = 30 1/7.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, let's find the total cost of the toy, including tax. The cost of the toy is 18 dollars, and the tax is 41/14 dollars. To add these amounts, we need to find a common denominator, which is 14. So, we can rewrite 18 as 18 Ã— 14/14 = 252/14. Now, we can add the cost and tax: 252/14 + 41/14 = 293/14.

To find the total cost, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 293 Ã· 14 = 20.93 (approximately).

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Susan had: 48 - 20.93 = 27.07.

            Walter pays 23/21 dollars for a pen. After buying the pen, he still has 46 dollars left. How much money did he have originally?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say Walter had x dollars originally.

We know that after buying the pen, he had 46 dollars left, so the amount he spent on the pen is x - 46.

The cost of the pen is 23/21 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

x - 46 = 23/21

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 21 to eliminate the fraction:

21(x - 46) = 23

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

21x - 966 = 23

Adding 966 to both sides gives us:

21x = 989

Dividing both sides by 21, we get:

x = 989/21
x = 47.1

So Walter had 47.1 dollars originally.

The ship already has an existing cargo load of 50/11 tons. To add this to the total cargo, we need to find a common denominator, which is 286. So, we can convert 50/11 to 1400/286 and 261/26 to 2451/286.

The total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after it loads all 39 containers is 1400/286 + 2451/286 = 3851/286 tons.

5/40 = 0.125 gallons (amount poured out)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add the time spent on the journey and the break, we need to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 17 and 4 is 68. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 68:

43/17 = (43*4)/(17*4) = 172/68
31/4 = (31*17)/(4*17) = 527/68

Now we can add the two fractions:

172/68 + 527/68 = (172 + 527)/68 = 699/68

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. So, the total time spent on the journey and the break is 699/68 hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already found the total time spent on the journey and the break to be 699/68 hours. To add the additional 50 hours, we need to convert 699/68 to a mixed number:

699/68 = 10 29/68

Now, we can add 50 hours to this mixed number:

10 29/68 + 50 = 60 29/68

To convert this back to an improper fraction, we multiply the whole number part by the denominator and add the numerator:

60*68 + 29 = 4089 + 29 = 4118

So, the total time spent on all segments of the journey and the break is:

4118/68 hours

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the amount of money Oscar spends on the video game, we need to find 13/41 of $33.

First, we can convert the fraction 13/41 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 13 Ã· 41 = 0.317.

Then, we can multiply $33 by 0.317 to find the amount Oscar spends: $33 Ã— 0.317 = $10.461.

Since we can't have a fraction of a cent, we round $10.461 to $10.46.
