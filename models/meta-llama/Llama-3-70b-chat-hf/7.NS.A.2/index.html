        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the product, I'll multiply the numerators (29 and 19) and multiply the denominators (2 and 28), then simplify the fraction:

(29/2) Ã— (19/28) = (29 Ã— 19) / (2 Ã— 28)
= 551 / 56

To simplify the fraction, I'll look for common factors between the numerator and denominator. In this case, both numbers are divisible by 1, but that's not helpful. However, I can see that 551 is a prime number, and 56 is divisible by 2, 4, 7, and 8. Since there are no common factors, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">I already calculated the product of (29/2) and (19/28) as 551/56. Now, I'll multiply this result by (8/28):

(551/56) Ã— (8/28) = (551 Ã— 8) / (56 Ã— 28)
= 4408 / 1568

To simplify the fraction, I'll look for common factors between the numerator and denominator. Both numbers are divisible by 8, so I'll divide both by 8:

4408 Ã· 8 = 551
1568 Ã· 8 = 196

Now, I'll look for common factors between 551 and 196. Since 551 is a prime number, I'll focus on 196, which is divisible by 2, 4, 7, and 14. However, I can see that 196 is also divisible by 49 (7 Ã— 7). And, as it turns out, 551 is also divisible by 7:

551 Ã· 7 = 79
196 Ã· 7 = 28

Now, I'll divide both numbers by 7:

4408 / 1568 = (79 Ã— 7) / (28 Ã— 7) = 79/28

            Susan has a recipe that calls for 30 parts of flour to 27 parts of water. If she decides to use 29 parts of flour instead, and she keeps the water proportion the same, how much water will she use? Calculate this using fraction multiplication: ((30 / 30) * (29 / 27)).

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break it down step by step:

The original ratio of flour to water is 30:27. Since Susan wants to use 29 parts of flour instead, we need to find the equivalent amount of water to maintain the same proportion.

We can set up a fraction multiplication problem:

((30 / 30) * (29 / 27))

First, simplify the fraction (30 / 30) = 1, since 30 divided by 30 is 1.

Now, multiply 1 by (29 / 27):

1 * (29 / 27) = 29 / 27

To find the equivalent amount of water, multiply the numerator (29) by the original amount of water (27) and divide by the denominator (27):

(29 * 27) / 27 = 783 / 27 = 29

So, Susan will use 29 parts of water.

3. Multiply the two results: (12/11) Ã— (8/3)

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (12 Ã— 8) and multiply the denominators (11 Ã— 3), then simplify:

(12 Ã— 8) / (11 Ã— 3) = 96 / 33

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

Now, we need to divide 6.25 by 2.666... (or 8/3). To do this, we can convert 6.25 to an improper fraction, which is 25/4. Then, we can divide 25/4 by 8/3.

(25/4) Ã· (8/3) = (25/4) Ã— (3/8) = (25 Ã— 3) / (4 Ã— 8) = 75/32

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (numbers on top) and multiply the denominators (numbers on the bottom), like this:

(3/7) Ã— (26/6) = (3 Ã— 26) / (7 Ã— 6)

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:

78 Ã· 6 = 13

Morning: 28/21
Afternoon: 22/4

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 21 and 4 is 84. So, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 84:

Morning: (28/21) Ã— (4/4) = 112/84
Afternoon: (22/4) Ã— (21/21) = 462/84

Now we can add:

(112/84) + (462/84) = (112 + 462)/84 = 574/84

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already calculated the result of multiplying 14/10 by 30/5, which is 42/5.

Now, let's multiply 42/5 by 13/15:

(42/5) Ã— (13/15) = (42 Ã— 13) / (5 Ã— 15)

First, let's multiply the numerators: 42 Ã— 13 = 546

Next, let's multiply the denominators: 5 Ã— 15 = 75

So, the result of the multiplication is: 546/75

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

546 Ã· 3 = 182
75 Ã· 3 = 25

So, the simplified fraction is: 182/25

First, let's multiply the numerators: 30 Ã— 30 = 900

Next, let's multiply the denominators: 10 Ã— 5 = 50

So, the result of the multiplication is: 900/50

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50.

900 Ã· 50 = 18

            A baker is preparing a large batch of cookies that requires 26 cups of sugar per each full batch. If he only has enough sugar to make a fraction of the batch, represented by 29/14 of a full batch, how many batches of cookies can the baker make? Calculate this as ((26 / 1) / (29 / 14)).

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many batches of cookies the baker can make, we need to divide the amount of sugar he has (represented by 29/14 of a full batch) by the amount of sugar required for a full batch (26 cups).

Let's set up the division problem as a fraction:

((26 / 1) / (29 / 14))

To divide fractions, we can invert the second fraction (i.e., flip the numerator and denominator) and then multiply:

((26 / 1) Ã— (14 / 29))

Now, we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately:

(26 Ã— 14) / (1 Ã— 29)

= 364 / 29

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 29:

364 Ã· 29 = 12.55 (approximately)

Since we can't make a fraction of a batch, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the baker can make:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 15 by 3: 15 / 3 = 5
2. Divide 19 by 26: 19 / 26
3. Multiply the results: 5 * (19 / 26) = 5 * 19 / 26

Now, we can simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5, 19, and 26. The GCD is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form:

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:

Now, we can simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1330 and 624. The GCD is 2, so we can divide both numerator and denominator by 2:

The amount required in the recipe is 19/28.

So, the total amount of the ingredient required is 19/28 Ã— 7.5 = 19/28 Ã— 30/4 = 19/4 Ã— 15/14 = 285/56 = 5 5/56.

3. Multiply the two results: (15/2) * 1 = 15/2

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. So, the fraction remains the same:

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (27 and 10) and multiply the denominators (4 and 9), then simplify:

(27 * 10) / (4 * 9) = 270 / 36

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 18:

Now, we multiply the result by 25/4:

(242/133) Ã— (25/4) = (242 Ã— 25) / (133 Ã— 4) = 6050 / 532

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6050 and 532, which is 2. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:

6050 Ã· 2 = 3025
532 Ã· 2 = 266

            In the question before, we considered the multiplication of fractions (29 / 16) and (21 / 27). Now replace the fraction 16 in the denominator with 5.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's evaluate the new expression:

((29 / 5) * (21 / 27))

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:

(29 Ã— 21) / (5 Ã— 27)

= 609 / 135

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

609 Ã· 3 = 203
135 Ã· 3 = 45

So, the simplified result is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's multiply the fractions again:

(24/23) Ã— (18/3) = (24 Ã— 18) / (23 Ã— 3)

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

432 Ã· 3 = 144
69 Ã· 3 = 23

144 / 23

Now, we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's re-evaluate the expression with the new initial amount:

((5/15) divided by 5/15) multiplied by (4 divided by 1)

1. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
	* (5/15) divided by (5/15) = 1 (since any non-zero value divided by itself is 1)
	* 4 divided by 1 = 4
2. Multiply the results:
	* 1 multiplied by 4 = 4

However, since the initial amount was a fraction (5/15), we need to multiply 4 by this fraction to get the final result:

4 Ã— (5/15) = (4 Ã— 5) / 15 = 20 / 15

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

28 Ã· 4 = 7

So, (28 / 4) = 7/1 = 7.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know that ((21 / 1) / (26 / 20)) = 210/13.

Now, let's multiply this result by (21 / 29):

(210/13) Ã— (21/29) = (210 Ã— 21) / (13 Ã— 29) = 4410 / 377

We can simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4410 and 377, which is 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the total amount of sugar and flour needed, we need to multiply the amount of sugar and flour required for the original cake.

First, let's simplify the fractions:

12/2 = 6 (since 12 divided by 2 is 6)
17/14 = 17/14 (this fraction is already in its simplest form)

Now, let's multiply the two fractions:

(6) Ã— (17/14) = 6 Ã— 17/14 = 102/14

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

102 Ã· 2 = 51
14 Ã· 2 = 7

So, the simplified fraction is:

To simplify this fraction, we can look for common factors between the numerator and the denominator. However, 2268 and 323 are coprime, meaning they do not have any common factors other than 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply the result by the fraction (28/16), I'll perform the following calculation:

(57/16) Ã— (28/16) = (57 Ã— 28) / (16 Ã— 16) = 1596 / 256

To simplify this fraction, I can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8:

1596 Ã· 8 = 199
256 Ã· 8 = 32

So, the result of multiplying the previous result by the fraction (28/16) is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's calculate the product of 25/20 and 11/6 first:

(25/20) Ã— (11/6) = (25 Ã— 11) / (20 Ã— 6)

= 275 / 120

Now, let's multiply this result by 20/26:

(275 / 120) Ã— (20 / 26) = (275 Ã— 20) / (120 Ã— 26)

= 5500 / 3120

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 20.

5500 Ã· 20 = 275
3120 Ã· 20 = 156

So, the simplified fraction is:

275/156

Now, let's consider what would happen if we initially multiplied 25/17 instead of 25/20 by 11/6:

(25/17) Ã— (11/6) = (25 Ã— 11) / (17 Ã— 6)

= 275 / 102

Next, let's multiply this result by 20/26:

(275 / 102) Ã— (20 / 26) = (275 Ã— 20) / (102 Ã— 26)

= 5500 / 2652

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4.

5500 Ã· 4 = 1375
2652 Ã· 4 = 663

So, the simplified fraction is:

1375/663

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's multiply the result by the fraction (29/23):

(75/32) Ã— (29/23) = ?

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:

(75 Ã— 29) / (32 Ã— 23) = 2175 / 736

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

2175 Ã· 1 = 2175
736 Ã· 1 = 736

So, the simplified fraction is:

2175/736

In the context of the original scenario, this additional operation could represent a further division or scaling of the original portion. For example, if each person was originally getting 75/32 of a cookie, and now we want to divide each of those portions into 29 equal parts, but only give out 23 of those parts, the new portion size would be 2175/736 of a cookie.

This could represent a situation where the original portions were too large, so we need to sub-divide them further, but we don't want to give out the full sub-divided portion, so we're only giving out a fraction of it.</pre>

            After solving the previous problem, now evaluate the new expression ((25 / 8) * (29 / 4)). This means we have changed the second fraction from (3 / 4) to (29 / 4).

Under the previous scenario where the fractions referred to sharing or dividing amongst a group, consider what would happen if the proportions you multiplied with were changed to this new ratio. 

Write the result of ((25 / 8) * (29 / 4)) as a simplified fraction and reflect on the impact of this change in the real-world scenario.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate the new expression, we follow the same steps:

1. Divide 25 by 8: 25 Ã· 8 = 25/8 = 3 1/8
2. Multiply the result by 29/4: (3 1/8) Ã— (29/4) = (25/8) Ã— (29/4) = 725/32

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

725 Ã· 1 = 725
32 Ã· 1 = 32

So, the simplified fraction is:

725/32

Now, let's reflect on the impact of this change in the real-world scenario. Previously, we had 75 cookies to divide among 32 people, resulting in each person getting 75/32 of a cookie. With the new ratio, we're multiplying the original amount by 29/4 instead of 3/4.

This means we're increasing the proportion of cookies each person gets by a factor of 29/3. In other words, each person would now get approximately 9.67 times more cookies than before (29/3 â‰ˆ 9.67).

In this scenario, the change in ratio would result in a significant increase in the amount of cookies each person receives. Instead of getting a small fraction of a cookie, each person would now get a substantial amount, almost 10 times more than before. This could represent a change in policy or a decision to be more generous in the distribution of resources.</pre>

(28 / 4) Ã— (10 / 12) = (28 Ã— 10) / (4 Ã— 12)

= 280 / 48

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

280 Ã· 4 = 70
48 Ã· 4 = 12

So, the simplified fraction is:

70 / 12

            Previously, you calculated the result of the multiplication (27 / 14) * (19 / 14). Now, what if instead of 27, we had a value of 15? So calculate the new result for the multiplication problem (15 / 14) * (19 / 14). Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's recalculate the result of the multiplication with the new value:

(15 Ã· 14) = 15/14 = 1 1/14
(19 Ã· 14) = 19/14 = 1 5/14

Now, we'll multiply the two fractions:

(1 1/14) Ã— (1 5/14) = ?

Converting the mixed numbers to improper fractions:

(1 1/14) = (14 + 1)/14 = 15/14
(1 5/14) = (14 + 5)/14 = 19/14

Now, we can multiply the fractions:

(15/14) Ã— (19/14) = (15 Ã— 19) / (14 Ã— 14) = 285 / 196

The resulting fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7:

285 Ã· 7 = 41
196 Ã· 7 = 28

Let's multiply the two fractions:

(16/10) Ã— (13/17) = (16 Ã— 13) / (10 Ã— 17) = 208 / 170

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 26:

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:

405 Ã· 15 = 27
60 Ã· 15 = 4

So, the simplified result is: 27/4
