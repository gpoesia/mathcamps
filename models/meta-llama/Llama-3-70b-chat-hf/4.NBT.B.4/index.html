First, let's find the total number of doors produced:
2410 (doors produced in the first month) + 6445 (doors produced in the second month) = 8855

Now, let's subtract the number of doors sold from the total number of doors produced:
8855 (total doors produced) - 3511 (doors sold) = ?

8855 - 3511 = 5344

1. The store had 710 hats initially (from the first shipment).
2. After the second shipment, the store had 9956 hats in total.
3. To find the number of hats before the second shipment, we subtract the number of hats in the second shipment from the total: 9956 - 8962 = 1094.
4. Since the store had 710 hats initially, the number of hats before the second shipment is 1094.
5. To find the difference, subtract the initial number of hats from the number of hats before the second shipment: 1094 - 710 = 384.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the change in the snowball's mass, we need to subtract the final mass from the initial mass.

Initial mass = 6733 grams
Final mass = 4967 grams

Change in mass = Initial mass - Final mass
= 6733 - 4967
= 1766 grams

The change in the snowball's mass is a decrease of 1766 grams.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many gallons of water the company distributed, we need to subtract the amount of water they had remaining from the original amount.

Let's set up the equation:

Original amount - Amount distributed = Amount remaining
9955 - x = 5517

To solve for x, we can subtract 5517 from both sides of the equation:

9955 - 5517 = x
4438 = x

So, the company distributed 4438 gallons of water.
