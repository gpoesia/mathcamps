            A king has decided to build a number of castles in his kingdom. If each castle requires 5 builders and there are 15 builders in total, how many castles are being built?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the number of castles being built is x. Since each castle requires 5 builders, the total number of builders required is 5x. We know that there are 15 builders in total, so we can set up the equation 5x = 15.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5, which gives us x = 15/5 = 3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of usages, we need to divide the total amount of toothpaste (77 grams) by the amount used per usage (11 grams).

77 ÷ 11 = 7

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the manufacturer worked for x hours. Since they produce 8 watches every hour, the total number of watches produced is 8x. We know that they produced a total of 48 watches, so we can set up the equation 8x = 48. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 8, which gives us x = 48/8 = 6.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the rider rode the scooter for x hours. Since the shop charges $7 per hour, the total cost would be 7x. We know the rider spent $35, so we can set up the equation 7x = 35. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 7, which gives us x = 35/7 = 5.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's call the vertical height of the tent &quot;h&quot;. Since the vertical height is half of the diagonal length, we can set up the equation: h = (1/2) × 14.
To solve for h, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us: 2h = 14.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get: h = 14/2 = 7.

            On a sunny beach day, a group of children starts a fun game. Each child gets to throw a beach ball 7 times in a row. If there have been 21 beach ball throws in total, how many children are there?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say there are x children. Each child throws the beach ball 7 times, so the total number of throws is 7x. We know that the total number of throws is 21, so we can set up the equation 7x = 21. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7, which gives us x = 21/7 = 3.

9x = 18

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

x = 18/9
x = 2

So, there were 2 mermaids in the group.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say Linda currently has x dolls of that specific model.

If she doubles the quantity, she would have 2x dolls.

According to the problem, doubling the quantity would result in 2 dolls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

2x = 2

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 2/2
x = 1

So, Linda currently has 1 doll of that specific model.

We know that the store owner received enough pants to increase the stock from 24 to 48 (since 48 - 24 = 24, the number of new pants).

So, we can set up the equation: 12x = 24

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 12: x = 24/12
x = 2

            In a furniture warehouse, each door panel weighs 5kg. If the total weight of all door panels is 45kg, how many door panels are there in the warehouse?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say there are x door panels in the warehouse. Since each door panel weighs 5kg, the total weight of all door panels is 5x kg. We know that the total weight is 45kg, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 45

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 45 ÷ 5
x = 9

So, there are 9 door panels in the warehouse.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's say the weight of one cloud is w. Since all clouds have the same weight, the total weight of all 9 clouds is 9w.

We are given that the total weight of all 9 clouds is 9. So, we can set up the equation:

9w = 9

To find the weight of one cloud, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9:

w = 9/9
w = 1

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's call the original speed of the train &quot;x&quot; km/hr.

Since the speed is halved, the new speed is x/2 km/hr.

We are given that the new speed is 3 km/hr, so we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 3

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 3 × 2
x = 6

So, the original speed of the train is 6 km/hr.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the compass maker sold compasses for x days. Since he sells 12 compasses each day, the total number of compasses sold is 12x. We know that the total number of compasses sold is 84, so we can set up the equation 12x = 84. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 12, which gives us x = 84/12 = 7.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's work backwards to find the number of milk packets produced on the second day.

Since the farm produces 3 times the amount of milk packets each day, on the third day, it produced 3 times the amount it produced on the second day. Let's call the number of milk packets produced on the second day &quot;x&quot;. Then, on the third day, it produced 3x milk packets.

We know that on the third day, it produced 33 milk packets, so we can set up the equation:

3x = 33

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 33 ÷ 3
x = 11

So, the dairy farm produced 11 milk packets on the second day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say the helicopter has been used x times. According to the policy, it gets 10 hours of maintenance for every time it's used, so the total hours of maintenance would be 10x. We know that the total hours of maintenance is 70, so we can set up the equation:

10x = 70

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10:

x = 70/10
x = 7

So, the helicopter has been used 7 times.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since each period of continuous rain lasted for 8 days, and it rained a total of 24 days, we can divide the total number of rainy days by the number of days in each period to find the number of periods.

24 days (total) ÷ 8 days (per period) = 3 periods

Since dividing the fabric by 6 gives the number of pillows that can be made from it, we can set up the equation:

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6:

x = 3 × 6
x = 18

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Let's say there are x giraffes in the zoo. Since each giraffe eats 7 pounds of food, the total amount of food consumed by the giraffes is 7x pounds. We know that the total amount of food consumed is 28 pounds, so we can set up the equation:

7x = 28

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 28/7
x = 4

So, there are 4 giraffes in the zoo.

            In a shallow pool, a group of 30 starfish decided to divide themselves equally to live in different zones of the pool. If each zone contains 6 starfish, how many zones are there in total?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total number of zones, we need to divide the total number of starfish (30) by the number of starfish in each zone (6).

30 ÷ 6 = 5

So, there are 5 zones in total.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The astronaut has 88 hours of oxygen in total. If he can use the tank for 8 days, we can divide the total hours by the number of days to find the hours per day.

88 hours ÷ 8 days = 11 hours per day
