            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total amount of sugar used, we need to multiply the amount of sugar used for the cake by the amount of sugar used for the cookies.
The baker uses 9/4 cups of sugar for the cake and 16/15 cups for the cookies.
To multiply these two fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately.
The numerator of the product is 9 * 16 = &lt;&lt;9*16=144&gt;&gt;144.
The denominator of the product is 4 * 15 = &lt;&lt;4*15=60&gt;&gt;60.
Therefore, the baker will use 144/60 cups of sugar in total.
To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12.
144/60 = &lt;&lt;144/60=2.4&gt;&gt;2.4.

The baker uses 7/4 cups of sugar for the cake and 16/15 cups for the cookies.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total number of pizzas needed, we need to multiply the number of students by the amount of pizza each student will eat.
Total pizzas needed = 18 students * 17/20 pizza per student
Total pizzas needed = 18 * 17/20
Total pizzas needed = 306/20
Total pizzas needed = 15.3
Since we can't order a fraction of a pizza, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how much of the new grape juice Michael should use, we need to calculate the ratio of the servings he wants to make to the original servings, and then multiply it by the concentration ratio of the new grape juice to the old one.
The ratio of the servings is 12/16 = &lt;&lt;12/16=0.75&gt;&gt;0.75.
The concentration ratio of the new grape juice to the old one is 15/2 = &lt;&lt;15/2=7.5&gt;&gt;7.5.
Multiplying these two ratios together, we get 0.75 * 7.5 = &lt;&lt;0.75*7.5=5.625&gt;&gt;5.625.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total number of models prepared for the science fair, we need to multiply the fraction of students who participated (10/14) with the number of models each student made (8).
First, we need to convert the fraction 10/14 to a decimal. To do this, we divide the numerator (10) by the denominator (14): 10 Ã· 14 = 0.7142857142857143
Next, we multiply this decimal by the number of models each student made (8): 0.7142857142857143 Ã— 8 = 5.714285714285714
Since we cannot have a fraction of a model, we round the result to the nearest whole number: 5.714285714285714 â‰ˆ 6
Therefore, the total number of models prepared for the science fair is 6.
