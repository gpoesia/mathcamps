        There are 73841 cubic centimeters of air needed to inflate a large beach ball. If we fill the ball up at a rate of 41 cubic centimeters per second, how many seconds will it take to fully inflate the beach ball?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the time it takes to inflate the beach ball, we need to divide the total volume of air needed by the rate at which the air is being filled.
Time = Total volume of air / Rate of filling

        In the previous space mission scenario, if instead, the spaceship had to divide its total travel distance of 38745 miles into 3113 equal stages, how many miles would it now have to travel in each stage?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the distance traveled in each stage, we need to divide the total distance by the number of stages.
Total distance = 38745 miles
Number of stages = 3113
Distance per stage = Total distance / Number of stages
Distance per stage = 38745 miles / 3113
Distance per stage = &lt;&lt;38745/3113=12.445&gt;&gt;12.445 miles

Messages per their &quot;day&quot; = Total number of messages / Number of their &quot;days&quot;

        Considering our previous calculation, if a bear travels a total of 31470 feet but this time over 1406 days instead of 30 days and still travels the same distance each day, how many feet does it travel each day now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the distance traveled each day, we need to divide the total distance by the number of days.
Distance traveled each day = Total distance / Number of days
Distance traveled each day = 31470 feet / 1406 days
Distance traveled each day = &lt;&lt;31470/1406=22.38&gt;&gt;22.38 feet
