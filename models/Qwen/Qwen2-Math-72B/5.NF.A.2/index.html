        Captain Silverbeard found 10/13 of a treasure map at one shipwreck site and 16/19 of the same treasure map at another site. What is the total portion of the treasure map that he found?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total portion of the treasure map Captain Silverbeard found, we need to add the fractions 10/13 and 16/19.
First, we find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 13 * 19 = &lt;&lt;13*19=247&gt;&gt;247.
Next, we convert the fractions to have the common denominator: 10/13 = &lt;&lt;10*19=190&gt;&gt;190/247 and 16/19 = &lt;&lt;16*13=208&gt;&gt;208/247.
Now, we can add the fractions: 190/247 + 208/247 = &lt;&lt;190+208=408&gt;&gt;408/247.

        If Sam's binoculars increase his range of sight by 3/14 of a mile and Joe's binoculars increase his range of sight by exactly 1 mile (16/16), what is their combined range increase when they use the binoculars one after the other?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Sam's binoculars increase his range of sight by 3/14 of a mile.
Joe's binoculars increase his range of sight by 1 mile (16/16).
To find the combined range increase, we need to add the two fractions: 3/14 + 16/16.
First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 14 and 16 is 112.
Next, we convert the two fractions to have the common denominator of 112: 3/14 = 24/112 and 16/16 = 112/112.
Now, we can add the two fractions: 24/112 + 112/112 = 136/112.
Finally, we simplify the fraction: 136/112 = 1 24/112 = 1 3/14.

        At the end of a rainbow, there are pots filled with magical gold coins. One pot contains 12/13 of a pound of gold coins while another contains 3/2 pounds of gold coins. How much gold is there in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total amount of gold, we need to add the amount of gold in the first pot to the amount of gold in the second pot.
The first pot contains 12/13 pounds of gold coins.
The second pot contains 3/2 pounds of gold coins.
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 2 is 26.
So, we convert 12/13 to 24/26 and 3/2 to 39/26.
Now, we can add the fractions: 24/26 + 39/26 = 63/26.
Therefore, the total amount of gold is 63/26 pounds.

        Mr. Carpenter makes crafting chairs a meticulous process. He takes 5/3 hours to build the frame and additional 10/13 hours to upholster it. How long does it take for him to build a chair from start to finish?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total time, we need to add the time taken to build the frame and the time taken to upholster it.
Time taken to build the frame = 5/3 hours
Time taken to upholster = 10/13 hours
Total time = 5/3 + 10/13
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 13 is 39.
Converting both fractions to have a denominator of 39:
5/3 = (5 * 13) / (3 * 13) = 65/39
10/13 = (10 * 3) / (13 * 3) = 30/39

Time taken to build the frame = 5/3 hours
Time taken to upholster = 10/13 hours
Time taken to apply the varnish = 8/19 hours
Total time = 5/3 + 10/13 + 8/19
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3, 13, and 19 is 741.
Converting all fractions to have a denominator of 741:
5/3 = (5 * 247) / (3 * 247) = 1235/741
10/13 = (10 * 57) / (13 * 57) = 570/741

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total amount of money Bob has, we need to add the amounts in each pocket.
First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 11/3 and 12/19. The least common multiple of 3 and 19 is 57.
Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 57, we get:
11/3 = (11 * 19) / (3 * 19) = 209/57
12/19 = (12 * 3) / (19 * 3) = 36/57
Now, we can add the fractions:
209/57 + 36/57 = (209 + 36) / 57 = 245/57
Therefore, Bob has a total of 245/57 dollars in his wallet.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The clown took a total break of 13/5 hours and performed for 53/40 hours.
To find the remaining time, we need to subtract the performance time from the total break time.
13/5 - 53/40 = &lt;&lt;13/5-53/40=104/40-53/40=51/40&gt;&gt;51/40 hours.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total amount of firewood collected, we need to add the amounts collected by Sarah and Alex.
Sarah collected 11/20 pounds of firewood.
Alex collected 9/7 pounds of firewood.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 7 is 140.
Sarah collected (11/20) * (7/7) = 77/140 pounds of firewood.
Alex collected (9/7) * (20/20) = 180/140 pounds of firewood.
Adding these fractions, we get 77/140 + 180/140 = 257/140 pounds of firewood.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the total amount of magic dust used, we need to add the two amounts together.
First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 12 and 10 is 60.
So, we convert 11/12 to 55/60 and 9/10 to 54/60.
Now, we can add the two fractions: 55/60 + 54/60 = &lt;&lt;55/60+54/60=109/60&gt;&gt;109/60.
To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.
So, the total amount of magic dust used is 109/60 oz.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: First, we need to find the total amount of magic dust used by the fairy. We already know that she used 109/60 oz of magic dust over the field and apple trees.
Now, we need to subtract this amount from the original amount of magic dust she had, which was 14/3 oz.
To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 60 and 3 is 60.
So, we convert 14/3 to 280/60.
Now, we can subtract the two fractions: 280/60 - 109/60 = &lt;&lt;280/60-109/60=171/60&gt;&gt;171/60.
To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.
So, the fairy has 57/20 oz of magic dust left.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the three fractions. The least common multiple of 12, 10, and 10 is 60.
So, we convert 11/12 to 55/60, 9/10 to 54/60, and 16/10 to 96/60.
Now, we can add the three fractions: 55/60 + 54/60 + 96/60 = &lt;&lt;55/60+54/60+96/60=205/60&gt;&gt;205/60.
To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Anne and Bob painted 1 1/20 of the table.
Carl painted 11/5 of the table.
Together, they painted 1 1/20 + 11/5 = &lt;&lt;1 1/20+11/5=1 1/20+22/20=23/20&gt;&gt;23/20 of the table.
Since the table is a whole, we can simplify 23/20 to 1 3/20.

        Suppose before Carl added more paint, instead of Bob painting an additional 5/20 of the table, he could only manage to paint 5/14 of it. In this case, how much of the table has been painted by Anne and Bob together?
    </p>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Anne painted 16/20 of the table, and Bob painted 5/14 of the table.
To find the total amount of the table painted, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.
The least common multiple of 20 and 14 is 140.
So, Anne painted 16/20 = &lt;&lt;16*7/20*7=112/140&gt;&gt;112/140 of the table, and Bob painted 5/14 = &lt;&lt;5*10/14*10=50/140&gt;&gt;50/140 of the table.
Together, they painted 112/140 + 50/140 = &lt;&lt;112/140+50/140=162/140&gt;&gt;162/140 of the table.
Since the table is a whole, we can simplify 162/140 to 1 11/70.

        The star Alpha shines 17/3 times brighter than an average star, while the star Bravo shines 20/16 times as bright. How much brighter are both stars compared to an average star if you add up the relative brightness of these two stars?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The star Alpha shines 17/3 times brighter than an average star.
The star Bravo shines 20/16 times as bright.
To find the total brightness of both stars compared to an average star, we need to add the relative brightness of Alpha and Bravo.
First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 17/3 and 20/16. The least common multiple of 3 and 16 is 48.
Converting the fractions to have a common denominator of 48:
17/3 = (17 * 16) / (3 * 16) = 272/48
20/16 = (20 * 3) / (16 * 3) = 60/48
Now, we can add the fractions:
272/48 + 60/48 = (272 + 60) / 48 = 332/48
Simplifying the fraction:
332/48 = 6.91666666667
Therefore, the total brightness of both stars compared to an average star is approximately 6.92 times brighter.

        Continuing from the previous scenario, let's suppose the colonial fireplace in the early morning burns firewood at a slightly different rate of 8/15 cords per hour instead of 4/15 cords per hour.  The late night burning rate remains the same at 14/15 cords per hour. Given these new circumstances, how much firewood does the fireplace burn in total in one hour split between the early morning and late night?
