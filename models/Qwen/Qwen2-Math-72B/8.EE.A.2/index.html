We are given that the volume of the container is 512 cubic feet.
Therefore, we can set up the equation 512 = s^3.
To solve for s, we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:
s = cube root of 512
s = 8
Therefore, the length of one side of the cubic container is 8 feet.

We are given that the volume of the perfume bottle is 125 cubic centimeters.
So, we can set up the equation: 125 = s^3
To solve for s, we need to take the cube root of both sides of the equation: s = cube root of 125
The cube root of 125 is 5, so the length of each side of the bottle is 5 centimeters.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cuboid is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. Since the building is a pencil-shaped building with a uniform cross-sectional area all along its height, we can assume that the length, width, and height are all equal. Let's call this length/width/height &quot;s&quot;. Then, the volume of the building is given by V = s^3. We are given that the volume of the building is 216 cubic meters. Therefore, we have s^3 = 216. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get s = 6. Therefore, the length of one side of the building is 6 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of one side of the cube.
We are given that the volume of the container is 216 cubic meters.
So, we have 216 = s^3.
To find the length of one side of the cube, we need to find the cube root of 216.
The cube root of 216 is 6.
Therefore, the length of one side of the cube container is 6 meters.

We are given that the volume of the box is 729 cubic feet, so we can set up the equation 729 = s^3.
To solve for s, we take the cube root of both sides of the equation: s = âˆ›729.
The cube root of 729 is 9, so the length of one edge of the box is 9 feet.

Given that the volume of the oven is 125 cubic inches, we can set up the equation 125 = f^3.
To find the length of each side of the loaf, we need to find the cube root of 125.
The cube root of 125 is 5.
Therefore, the length of each side of the loaf is 5 inches.

We are given that the volume of the strawberry is 64 cubic millimeters.
Therefore, we can set up the equation 64 = s^3.
To solve for s, we take the cube root of both sides of the equation: s = âˆ›64 = 4.
Therefore, the length of one side of the strawberry is 4 millimeters.

Given that the volume of the rocket is 216 cubic meters, we can set up the equation 216 = s^3.
To solve for s, we take the cube root of both sides of the equation: s = âˆ›216.
Calculating the cube root of 216, we find that s = 6.
Therefore, the length of each side of the rocket is 6 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of each side.
We are given that the volume of the toy car is 64 cubic inches.
So, we can set up the equation 64 = s^3.
To solve for s, we take the cube root of both sides of the equation.
The cube root of 64 is 4.
Therefore, the length of each side of the toy car is 4 inches.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cuboid is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. Since the height and width are the same, we can say that w = h. Therefore, the volume of the cuboidal trailer can be written as V = l^2 * h. We are given that V = 8 cubic meters and w = h. Substituting these values into the formula, we get 8 = l^2 * h. Since w = h, we can substitute h for w in the equation, giving us 8 = l^2 * l. Simplifying this equation, we get 8 = l^3. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get l = 2. Therefore, the length of a side of this cubical cargo space is 2 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = a^3, where a is the length of the edge of the cube.
Given that the volume of the cubical hole is 8 cubic feet, we can set up the equation 8 = a^3.
To find the length of the edge, we need to find the cube root of 8.
The cube root of 8 is 2.
Therefore, the length of the edge of the cubic hole is 2 feet.

            A book is written with a unique style where every page is in the shape of a cube. If the volume of one page is 64 cubic inches, what is the side length of each page?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the side length of the cube.
Given that the volume of one page is 64 cubic inches, we can set up the equation 64 = s^3.
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get s = 4 inches.
