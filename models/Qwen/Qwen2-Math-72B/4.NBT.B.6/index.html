Since the baker can only distribute whole cookies, he distributed 4 cookies to each orphanage.
The baker distributed a total of 4*186 = &lt;&lt;4*186=744&gt;&gt;744 cookies.
The baker has 928-744 = &lt;&lt;928-744=184&gt;&gt;184 cookies left.

Since the baker can only distribute whole cookies, he distributed 0 cookies to each orphanage.
The baker distributed a total of 0*186 = &lt;&lt;0*186=0&gt;&gt;0 cookies.
The baker has 173-0 = &lt;&lt;173-0=173&gt;&gt;173 cookies left.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of full boxes is 975/196 = &lt;&lt;975/196=4.974489795918367&gt;&gt;4.974489795918367, which rounds down to 4 full boxes.
The number of slices in the full boxes is 4*196 = &lt;&lt;4*196=784&gt;&gt;784 slices.
The number of leftover slices is 975-784 = &lt;&lt;975-784=191&gt;&gt;191 slices.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The crayon factory makes 994 crayons in one operation.
Each box holds 425 crayons.
To find out how many crayons will be left out of the boxes, we need to subtract the number of crayons that can fit in the boxes from the total number of crayons made.
994 - 425 = &lt;&lt;994-425=569&gt;&gt;569 crayons will be left out of the boxes after the operation.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

Since they can't have a fraction of a viewing evening, they will have 4 viewing evenings.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of boxes needed to pack all the teddy bears is 369/270 = &lt;&lt;369/270=1.3666666666666667&gt;&gt;1.3666666666666667.
Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2.
The number of teddy bears that can be packed in 2 boxes is 2*270 = &lt;&lt;2*270=540&gt;&gt;540.
The number of teddy bears that will be left is 540-369 = &lt;&lt;540-369=171&gt;&gt;171.

        A song has 334 words in it. If each line in the song has 23 words, how many words would be in the incomplete line at the end of the song?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total number of words in the song is 334.
The number of complete lines in the song is 334/23 = &lt;&lt;334/23=14.521739130434783&gt;&gt;14.521739130434783.
Since we can't have a fraction of a line, we round down to 14 complete lines.
The number of words in the incomplete line is 334 - (14*23) = &lt;&lt;334-(14*23)=10&gt;&gt;10.

The teacher will have 256-336 = &lt;&lt;256-336=-80&gt;&gt;-80 pages left to print after the third run.
Since the number of pages left to print cannot be negative, the teacher will have 0 pages left to print after the third run.

        There are 846 water droplets in a cloud. Each raindrop needs 722 droplets to form. If all droplets are used to form raindrops, how many droplets would be left unconverted in the cloud after reaching the maximum number of rain drops?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of raindrops that can be formed is 846/722 = &lt;&lt;846/722=1.1717732989029086&gt;&gt;1.1717732989029086. Since we can't have a fraction of a raindrop, we can only form 1 raindrop. The number of droplets used to form this raindrop is 722. Therefore, the number of droplets left unconverted is 846-722 = &lt;&lt;846-722=124&gt;&gt;124.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

Since we can't have a fraction of a raindrop, we can only form 1 raindrop. The number of droplets used to form this raindrop is 442.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: There are 265 unicorns in total and 146 sections.

Since the number of unicorns must be a whole number, we round down to 1 unicorn per section. Therefore, there are 146 unicorns in the complete sections and 265-146 = &lt;&lt;265-146=119&gt;&gt;119 unicorns in the last incomplete section.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: There are 265 unicorns in total and 781 sections.

Since the number of unicorns must be a whole number, we round down to 0 unicorns per section.

        In a forest, there are 386 animals. Each woodlands territory can support 95 animals. If the existing animals are evenly distributed among the territories, how many animals will be left in the last not fully occupied territory?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: There are 386/95 = &lt;&lt;386/95=4.063157894736842&gt;&gt;4.063157894736842 territories. Since we can't have a fraction of a territory, we round down to 4 territories.
Each territory can support 95 animals, so 4 territories can support 4*95 = &lt;&lt;4*95=380&gt;&gt;380 animals.
There are 386-380 = &lt;&lt;386-380=6&gt;&gt;6 animals left in the last not fully occupied territory.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: There are 497/95 = &lt;&lt;497/95=5.231578947368421&gt;&gt;5.231578947368421 territories. Since we can't have a fraction of a territory, we round down to 5 territories.
Each territory can support 95 animals, so 5 territories can support 5*95 = &lt;&lt;5*95=475&gt;&gt;475 animals.
There are 497-475 = &lt;&lt;497-475=22&gt;&gt;22 animals left in the last not fully occupied territory.

Since we can't cut a fraction of a piece, we can only cut 1 piece from the rope.
The length of the last piece will be 934 - 902 = &lt;&lt;934-902=32&gt;&gt;32 meters.

Since we can't cut a fraction of a piece, we can only cut 0 pieces from the rope.
The length of the last piece will be 202 meters.

        A cloud changes its shape by reducing its water droplets. Initially, there were 516 droplets in the cloud. If the cloud loses water droplets at an equal rate and becomes entirely dry after every 289 droplets, how many droplets will be left when the cloud is dry after the final cycle?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The cloud loses water droplets in cycles of 289. To find out how many droplets are left after the final cycle, we need to determine how many complete cycles of 289 droplets can be subtracted from the initial 516 droplets.
516 - 289 = &lt;&lt;516-289=227&gt;&gt;227 droplets left after the first cycle.
Since 227 is less than 289, the cloud will be dry after the first cycle, and no droplets will be left.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of boxes needed to pack all the shirts is 258/67 = &lt;&lt;258/67=3.8507462686567164&gt;&gt;3.8507462686567164.
Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4.
The total number of shirts that can be packed in 4 boxes is 4*67 = &lt;&lt;4*67=268&gt;&gt;268.
Therefore, the number of shirts left outside the boxes is 268-258 = &lt;&lt;268-258=10&gt;&gt;10.

Since the manufacturer can't create a fraction of a pack, they can only create 8 packs.

        A stationery store received a shipment of 842 erasers. The store owner wants to display them in boxes, with each box containing 719 erasers. After filling as many boxes as possible, how many erasers will be left over?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find the number of erasers left over, we need to divide the total number of erasers by the number of erasers in each box and find the remainder.
842 ÷ 719 = 1 remainder 123

The farmer can pack 1*244 = &lt;&lt;1*244=244&gt;&gt;244 carrots into the full box.
