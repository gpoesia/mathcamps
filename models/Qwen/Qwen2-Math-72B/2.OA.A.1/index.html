            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 72B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: We can find the number of crop circles we yet to discover by subtracting the number of crop circles we already found from the total number of crop circles.
We can write this as: total crop circles - crop circles found = crop circles yet to discover.
We know that the total number of crop circles is 82 and the number of crop circles we already found is 34.
So, the number of crop circles we yet to discover is 82 - 34 = &lt;&lt;82-34=48&gt;&gt;48.

After removing 3 gallons, the amount of water left in the tank was g-3 gallons.
We know that the remaining amount of water is 40 gallons, so we can set up the equation g-3=40.
Solving for g, we get g=40+3=&lt;&lt;40+3=43&gt;&gt;43 gallons.
