        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Captain Jack has 4 cannons on his ship.
Each cannon fires 12 cannonballs.
To find the total number of cannonballs fired, we multiply the number of cannons by the number of cannonballs each cannon fires.
Total cannonballs = 4 cannons * 12 cannonballs/cannon = &lt;&lt;4*12=48&gt;&gt;48 cannonballs.

Each cannon can now fire only 3 cannonballs.
To find the total number of cannonballs fired, we multiply the number of cannons by the number of cannonballs each cannon can fire.

            In the previous problem we found out that a tiger can travel 6 miles in an hour. But what if the tiger could cover more ground in the same time span? If the tiger can travel 7 times as far in an hour, how far can it travel then?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The tiger can travel 6 miles in an hour.
If the tiger can travel 7 times as far in an hour, it can travel 6 miles/hour * 7 = &lt;&lt;6*7=42&gt;&gt;42 miles in an hour.
