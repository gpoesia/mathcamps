        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.
We know that the perimeter is 324 meters and the length is 83 meters.
So, we can write the equation as 324 = 2(83 + w).
Solving for w, we get w = (324 - 2*83)/2 = &lt;&lt;(324 - 2*83)/2=79&gt;&gt;79 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(length + width). Let's denote the unknown side as width. We have 2*(49 + width) = 194. Solving for width, we get 49 + width = 194/2 = &lt;&lt;194/2=97&gt;&gt;97. Therefore, width = 97 - 49 = &lt;&lt;97-49=48&gt;&gt;48 cm.

            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 72B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, we know that the perimeter is 128 meters and the width is 57 meters. We can use this information to solve for the length.
First, we can substitute the known values into the formula: 128 = 2(l + 57).
Next, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2: 64 = l + 57.
Finally, we can solve for l by subtracting 57 from both sides: l = 64 - 57 = 7.
Therefore, the length of the other side of the garden is 7 meters.

Given that the perimeter P = 228 meters and the length l = 90 meters, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the width w.
228 = 2(90 + w)
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. Since the length of the rectangle is 69 feet, the other two sides must have a combined length of 150 - 69 = &lt;&lt;150-69=81&gt;&gt;81 feet.
Since the rectangle has two equal sides, each side must have a length of 81/2 = &lt;&lt;81/2=40.5&gt;&gt;40.5 feet.
Therefore, the width of the rectangle is 40.5 feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. If one side is 35m, then the other side is also 35m (since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal). Therefore, the perimeter is 2*(35m + x), where x is the length of the other side. We can set up the equation 2*(35m + x) = 166m and solve for x.
2*(35m + x) = 166m
70m + 2x = 166m
2x = 166m - 70m
2x = 96m
x = 48m

Given that the perimeter P = 138 feet and the length l = 46 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the width w.
138 = 2(46 + w)
138 = 92 + 2w

Given that the perimeter is 200 meters and the length is 49 meters, we can set up the equation: 200 = 2 * (49 + Width).
Simplifying the equation, we get: 200 = 98 + 2 * Width.
Subtracting 98 from both sides, we have: 102 = 2 * Width.
Dividing both sides by 2, we find: Width = 51 meters.

            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 72B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.
We know that the perimeter is 144 feet and the length is 38 feet.
Substituting these values into the formula, we get 144 = 2(38 + w).
Simplifying, we get 144 = 76 + 2w.
Subtracting 76 from both sides, we get 68 = 2w.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get w = 34.
Therefore, the length of the other side of the rectangle is 34 feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.
Given that the perimeter is 224 cm and one side (length) is 78 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the width.
224 = 2(78 + w)
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
112 = 78 + w
Subtracting 78 from both sides, we get:
w = 112 - 78
w = &lt;&lt;112-78=34&gt;&gt;34 cm

Given that the perimeter is 157m and three sides are 97m, 5m, and 30m, we can find the length of the fourth side by subtracting the sum of the lengths of the three known sides from the total perimeter.

The sum of the lengths of the three known sides is 97m + 5m + 30m = &lt;&lt;97+5+30=132&gt;&gt;132m.

Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 157m - 132m = &lt;&lt;157-132=25&gt;&gt;25m.

            The perimeter of a quadrilateral is 191 units. If one side is 35 units in length, another side is 76 units, and the third side is 5 units, what is the length of the fourth side in units?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 72B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
Let the length of the fourth side be x units.
Then, the perimeter of the quadrilateral is 35 + 76 + 5 + x = 191 units.
Simplifying the equation, we get 116 + x = 191.
Subtracting 116 from both sides, we get x = 191 - 116 = &lt;&lt;191-116=75&gt;&gt;75 units.
Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 75 units.

            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 72B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.
Given that the perimeter P = 198 cm and the length l = 90 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the width w.
198 = 2(90 + w)
198 = 180 + 2w
198 - 180 = 2w
18 = 2w
w = 18/2
w = 9 cm

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is the sum of all its sides. Since a square has four equal sides, we can find the length of one side by dividing the perimeter by 4.
The length of one side of the square is 72m / 4 = &lt;&lt;72/4=18&gt;&gt;18m.

The total length of the fence is 166m, so the combined length of the other two sides is 166-38 = &lt;&lt;166-38=128&gt;&gt;128m.
Since the other two sides are equal in length, each side is 128/2 = &lt;&lt;128/2=64&gt;&gt;64m.

Let the length of the fourth side be x.
Therefore, 29m + 16m + 41m + x = 160m
