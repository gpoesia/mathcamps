            A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?

Given this new information, and assuming that the energy extracted from the 704 lettuce leaves over 22 days still allowed it to move an additional inch per day, how far does the snail now travel in a day?

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Building on our beachcomber's tale, after counting his 42-day collection of seashells, he accidentally loses one seashell down a seaside crevice. Disappointed but not defeated, he decides to collect 32 more seashells the next day. How many seashells does he have in total after adding the new batch and accounting for the lost seashell?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The beachcomber had 3164 seashells after 42 days.
After losing one seashell, he had 3164-1 = &lt;&lt;3164-1=3163&gt;&gt;3163 seashells.
After collecting 32 more seashells, he had 3163+32 = &lt;&lt;3163+32=3195&gt;&gt;3195 seashells in total.

            Let's revisit our beachcomber. After reconsidering his collection habit, he realizes he has been actually collecting an average of 89 seashells per day instead of 74, over the same 42 day period. He still found that additional 56 seashells hidden in the sand. Now, how many seashells does he have in total after 42 days?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The beachcomber collected 89*42 = &lt;&lt;89*42=3738&gt;&gt;3738 seashells in 42 days.
The beachcomber had 3738+56 = &lt;&lt;3738+56=3794&gt;&gt;3794 seashells in total after 42 days.
### Answer: 3794
