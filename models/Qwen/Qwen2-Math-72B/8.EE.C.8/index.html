            Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 72B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, we'll multiply the first equation by 12 and the second equation by 91 to make the coefficients of q the same:

1. (480 * s) - (1092 * q) = 444
2. (2730 * s) + (1092 * q) = 10991

Next, we'll add the two equations to eliminate q:

(480 * s) + (2730 * s) = 444 + 10991
(3210 * s) = 11435

Now, we'll solve for s:

s = 11435 / 3210
s = 3.562305295950156

Now that we have the value of s, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find q. Let's use the first equation:

(40 * 3.562305295950156) - (91 * q) = 37
142.49221183800624 - (91 * q) = 37

Now, we'll solve for q:

- (91 * q) = 37 - 142.49221183800624
- (91 * q) = -105.49221183800624

q = -105.49221183800624 / -91
q = 1.1592550751429257

### Answer: q = 1.1592550751429257, s = 3.562305295950156

            Solve the following system of equations for the values of b and m: 4 * b + 44 * m = 180

            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 72B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's solve the system of equations using substitution. First, we can solve the first equation for b: 4 * b = 180 - 44 * m
b = (180 - 44 * m) / 4
Now, we can substitute this expression for b into the second equation: 79 * m - 6 * ((180 - 44 * m) / 4) = 48
Simplifying the equation: 79 * m - (6 * 180) / 4 + (6 * 44 * m) / 4 = 48
79 * m - 270 + 66 * m = 48
Combining like terms: 145 * m = 318
m = 318 / 145
m = 2.19310344828
Now, we can substitute the value of m back into the expression for b: b = (180 - 44 * 2.19310344828) / 4
b = (180 - 96.4965476244) / 4
b = 83.5034523756 / 4

            Solve the following system of equations to find the values of o and g: 

42 * o - 15 * g = 28 

47 * o + 29 * g = 141.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 72B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 29 and the second equation by 15 to make the coefficients of g in both equations equal:

29 * (42 * o - 15 * g) = 29 * 28 

15 * (47 * o + 29 * g) = 15 * 141

Simplifying these equations, we get:

1218 * o - 435 * g = 812 

705 * o + 435 * g = 2115

Now, we can add these two equations to eliminate the g term:

1218 * o - 435 * g + 705 * o + 435 * g = 812 + 2115

Simplifying this equation, we get:

1923 * o = 2927

Dividing both sides by 1923, we get:

o = 2927 / 1923

o = 1.522

Now, we can substitute the value of o back into one of the original equations to solve for g. Let's use the first equation:

42 * o - 15 * g = 28

42 * 1.522 - 15 * g = 28

63.924 - 15 * g = 28

Subtracting 63.924 from both sides, we get:

-15 * g = -35.924

Dividing both sides by -15, we get:

g = 2.395

            Given the following system of equations, determine the values of v and o: 
The first equation is: ((12 * v) - (6 * o)) = 21
The second equation is:  ((76 * v) - (45 * o)) = 50.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 45 and the second equation by 6 to make the coefficients of o the same:
45((12 * v) - (6 * o)) = 45 * 21
6((76 * v) - (45 * o)) = 6 * 50
This gives us:
540v - 270o = 945
456v - 270o = 300
Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate o:
(540v - 270o) - (456v - 270o) = 945 - 300
This simplifies to:
84v = 645
Now, we can solve for v:
v = 645 / 84
v = 7.678571428571429
Now that we have the value of v, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for o. Let's use the first equation:
((12 * 7.678571428571429) - (6 * o)) = 21
This simplifies to:
92.14285714285714 - 6o = 21
Now, we can solve for o:
6o = 92.14285714285714 - 21
6o = 71.14285714285714
o = 71.14285714285714 / 6
o = 11.857142857142858

150 * f + 6750 * g = 10725

g = 10449 / 6700 = &lt;&lt;10449/6700=1.56&gt;&gt;1.56
Finally, we can substitute the value of g back into one of the original equations to solve for f:

Substituting this expression for y into the second equation, we get: 7 = 65 * n - 79 * ((194 - 14 * n) / 4).
Simplifying this equation, we get: 7 = 65 * n - 194 * 19.75 + 14 * n * 19.75.

First, we can multiply equation 1 by 7 and equation 2 by 56 to make the coefficients of y the same:

1) 140 * p + 392 * y = 630
2) 4984 * p + 392 * y = 5488

Now, we can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate y:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the second equation by 33/10 to make the coefficients of d in both equations equal:

(33/10) * (10 * d + 14 * h) = (33/10) * 91

33 * d + 462 * h = 2997

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate d:

(33 * d + 462 * h) - (73 * h - 33 * d) = 2997 - 48

33 * d + 462 * h - 73 * h + 33 * d = 2949

66 * d + 389 * h = 2949

Next, we can solve for d in terms of h:

66 * d = 2949 - 389 * h

d = (2949 - 389 * h) / 66

Now, we can substitute this expression for d into the second equation:

10 * ((2949 - 389 * h) / 66) + 14 * h = 91

(29490 - 3890 * h) / 66 + 14 * h = 91

29490 - 3890 * h + 924 * h = 6006

-2966 * h = -23484

h = 23484 / 2966

h = 8

Now that we have the value of h, we can substitute it back into the expression for d:

d = (2949 - 389 * 8) / 66

d = (2949 - 3112) / 66

d = -163 / 66

d = -2.46969696969697

### Answer: h = 8, d = -2.46969696969697</pre>

            Solve the following system of equations for the values of q and e:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we will multiply the first equation by 43 and the second equation by 44 to make the coefficients of e in both equations equal:

1) 43 * (43 * q - 44 * e) = 43 * 29 
2) 44 * (30 * q + 43 * e) = 44 * 130

Simplifying the equations, we get:

1) 1849 * q - 1892 * e = 1247 
2) 1320 * q + 1892 * e = 5720

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate the e term:

1849 * q - 1892 * e + 1320 * q + 1892 * e = 1247 + 5720

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3169 * q = 6967

Dividing both sides by 3169, we get:

q = 6967 / 3169
q = 2.2

Now, we can substitute the value of q in any of the original equations to find the value of e. Let's substitute it in the first equation:

43 * 2.2 - 44 * e = 29

Simplifying the equation, we get:

94.6 - 44 * e = 29

Subtracting 94.6 from both sides, we get:

-44 * e = -65.6

Dividing both sides by -44, we get:

e = 65.6 / 44
e = 1.5

Therefore, the values of q and e are 2.2 and 1.5, respectively.

            Find the values of r and a in the following system of equations:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the second equation by 89 and the first equation by 37 to make the coefficients of r in both equations equal:

(89 * 109) = (89 * ((37 * a) + (6 * r)))
(37 * 53) = (37 * ((89 * r) - (74 * a)))

Simplifying these equations, we get:

9681 = (3293 * a) + (534 * r)
1961 = (3293 * r) - (2738 * a)

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the variable a:

(9681 - 1961) = ((3293 * a) + (534 * r)) - ((3293 * r) - (2738 * a))
7720 = (534 * r) + (2738 * a) - (3293 * r) + (2738 * a)
7720 = (534 * r) - (3293 * r) + (2738 * a) + (2738 * a)
7720 = (-2759 * r) + (5476 * a)

Now, we can solve for r by dividing both sides of the equation by -2759:

r = (7720 / -2759) + (5476 * a / -2759)
r = -2.80 + (-2 * a)

Substituting this expression for r into one of the original equations, we can solve for a:

53 = ((89 * (-2.80 + (-2 * a))) - (74 * a))
53 = (-249.20 + (-178 * a)) - (74 * a)
53 = -249.20 - (252 * a)

Now, we can solve for a by dividing both sides of the equation by -252:

a = (53 + 249.20) / -252
a = 302.20 / -252
a = -1.20

Finally, we can substitute the value of a back into the expression for r to find the value of r:

r = -2.80 + (-2 * (-1.20))
r = -2.80 + 2.40
r = -0.40

Therefore, the values of r and a in the system of equations are r = -0.40 and a = -1.20.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

From the first equation:
42g + 12q = 169

From the second equation:
12q - 50g = 19

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination for simplicity. Multiply the first equation by 50 and the second equation by 42 to align the coefficients of 'g':

50(42g + 12q) = 50(169)
42(12q - 50g) = 42(19)

This gives us:
2100g + 600q = 8450
504q - 2100g = 798

Adding these two equations to eliminate 'g':
600q + 504q = 8450 + 798
1104q = 9248
q = 9248 / 1104
q = 8.375

Substitute q back into one of the original equations to solve for 'g':
42g + 12(8.375) = 169
42g + 100.5 = 169
42g = 68.5
g = 68.5 / 42
g = 1.631

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of v the same:

74 * s - 22 * v = 108

Now, we can subtract the second equation from this new equation:

(74 * s - 22 * v) - (82 * s - 62 * v) = 108 - 41

This simplifies to:

-8 * s + 40 * v = 67

Now, we can solve for s:

s = (40 * v - 67) / 8

Next, we can substitute this expression for s into the first equation:

37 * ((40 * v - 67) / 8) - 11 * v = 54

Simplifying this equation, we get:

1480 * v - 2479 - 88 * v = 432

1392 * v = 2911

v = 2911 / 1392

Now, we can substitute this value of v back into the expression for s:

s = (40 * (2911 / 1392) - 67) / 8

Simplifying this expression, we get:

s = (116440 / 1392 - 67) / 8

s = (83.6 - 67) / 8

s = 16.6 / 8

s = 2.075

Therefore, the values of s and v are:

s = 2.075

v = 2911 / 1392

First, we can multiply the first equation by 48 and the second equation by 41 to make the coefficients of c in both equations equal:

48 * (41 * c + 65 * z) = 48 * 151
41 * (78 * z - 48 * c) = 41 * 48

This gives us:

1968 * c + 3120 * z = 7248
3198 * z - 1968 * c = 1968

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate c:

(1968 * c + 3120 * z) + (3198 * z - 1968 * c) = 7248 + 1968
3120 * z + 3198 * z = 9216
6318 * z = 9216
z = 9216 / 6318
z = 1.458

Now that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for c. Let's use the first equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's solve the system of equations:

1) 25v + 69d = 113
2) 26d + 42v = 85

To eliminate 'v', we can multiply equation 1 by 42 and equation 2 by 25, then subtract the second equation from the first:

42(25v + 69d) = 42(113)
25(26d + 42v) = 25(85)

1050v + 2898d = 4746
650d + 1050v = 2125

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

2898d - 650d = 4746 - 2125
2248d = 2621

Now, divide both sides by 2248 to find 'd':

d = 2621 / 2248
d = 1.165

Substitute 'd' back into equation 1 to find 'v':

25v + 69(1.165) = 113
25v + 80.385 = 113
25v = 113 - 80.385
25v = 32.615

Divide both sides by 25 to find 'v':

            Alex's and Brad's baskets contained c cherries and f figs respectively. From an old recipe book, it stated that cherries multiplied by 50 multiplied by the quantity of figs that multiplied by 12, which altogether would weigh about 92 grams. Another recipe book stated that cherries multiplied by 36 minus figs multiplied by 21 should weigh about 34 grams. Can you find the quantity of cherries (c) and figs (f)? Use the following system of equations to solve:

50c + 12f = 92
36c - 21f = 34.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 21 and the second equation by 12 to make the coefficients of f the same:

1050c + 252f = 1932
432c - 252f = 408

Next, we can add the two equations together to eliminate f:

1482c = 2340

Now, we can solve for c:

c = 2340 / 1482 = 1.57894736842

Since c must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 2.

Now that we have the value of c, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for f. Let's use the first equation:

50(2) + 12f = 92
100 + 12f = 92
12f = -8
f = -8 / 12 = -0.66666666667

Since f must also be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is -1.

However, since the number of figs cannot be negative, we must have made a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon reviewing our work, we see that we made a mistake when we rounded c to the nearest whole number. Since c must be a whole number, we should have rounded it to the nearest whole number that makes sense in the context of the problem. In this case, the only whole number that makes sense for c is 1.

Now that we have the correct value of c, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for f. Let's use the first equation:

50(1) + 12f = 92
50 + 12f = 92
12f = 42
f = 42 / 12 = 3.5

Since f must also be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 4.

Therefore, the quantity of cherries (c) is 1 and the quantity of figs (f) is 4.

10i + 13a = 160
Multiplying the first equation by 10 and the second by 4, we get:

40i + 52a = 640
Adding these two equations, we eliminate i:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of p in both equations equal:

2 * (27 * c - 18 * p) = 2 * 13
54 * c - 36 * p = 26

Now, we can add the two equations together to eliminate p:

(37 * p + 74 * c) + (54 * c - 36 * p) = 183 + 26
37 * p - 36 * p + 74 * c + 54 * c = 209
p + 128 * c = 209

Next, we can solve for p:

p = 209 - 128 * c

Now, we can substitute this expression for p into one of the original equations to solve for c. Let's use the first equation:

37 * (209 - 128 * c) + 74 * c = 183
7733 - 4736 * c + 74 * c = 183
-4662 * c = -7550
c = 7550 / 4662
c = 1.62

Finally, we can substitute this value of c back into the expression for p to find its value:

p = 209 - 128 * 1.62
p = 209 - 207.36
p = 1.64

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is p = 1.64 and c = 1.62.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 16 and the second equation by 30 to make the coefficients of p the same:
(48 * k) * 16 - (30 * p) * 16 = 37 * 16
(16 * p) * 30 + (33 * k) * 30 = 105 * 30
This gives us:
768 * k - 480 * p = 592
480 * p + 990 * k = 3150
Next, we can add the two equations together to eliminate p:
(768 * k - 480 * p) + (480 * p + 990 * k) = 592 + 3150
This simplifies to:
1758 * k = 3742
Dividing both sides by 1758 gives us:
k = 3742 / 1758 = 2.128
Now that we have the value of k, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for p. Using the first equation:
(48 * 2.128) - (30 * p) = 37
Simplifying this gives us:
102.144 - 30 * p = 37
Subtracting 102.144 from both sides gives us:
-30 * p = -65.144
Dividing both sides by -30 gives us:
p = 65.144 / 30 = 2.171

First, we'll multiply the first equation by 46 and the second equation by 69 to make the coefficients of f in both equations equal:

1. 3450v - 3174f = 644
2. 3174f + 3657v = 7690

Now, we'll subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate f:

3657v - 3450v = 7690 - 644
207v = 7046

Now, we'll solve for v:

v = 7046 / 207
v = &lt;&lt;7046/207=34&gt;&gt;34

Now that we have the value of v, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for f. Let's use the first equation:

2550 - 69f = 14
-69f = 14 - 2550
-69f = -2536

First, we can multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of k the same:
99 * k - 33 * d = 138
Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate k:
88 * d - 60 * k + 99 * k - 33 * d = 38 + 138
55 * d + 39 * k = 176
Next, we can solve for d:
d = (176 - 39 * k) / 55
Now, we can substitute this expression for d into one of the original equations to solve for k:
88 * ((176 - 39 * k) / 55) - 60 * k = 38
Simplifying this equation, we get:
1568 - 3432 * k / 55 - 60 * k = 38
Multiplying through by 55 to clear the fraction, we get:
86240 - 3432 * k - 3300 * k = 2090
Combining like terms, we get:
-6732 * k = -84150
Dividing both sides by -6732, we get:
k = 12.5
Now, we can substitute this value of k back into the expression for d to find its value:
d = (176 - 39 * 12.5) / 55
d = (176 - 487.5) / 55
d = -211.5 / 55

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the second equation by 12 to make the coefficients of z in both equations equal:
24 * z + 72 * y = 139
24 * z + 984 * y = 1152
Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate z:
(24 * z + 984 * y) - (24 * z + 72 * y) = 1152 - 139
912 * y = 1013
Now, we can solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation by 912:
y = 1013 / 912
y = 1.110745862
Next, we can substitute the value of y back into one of the original equations to solve for z. Let's use the first equation:
24 * z + 72 * y = 139
24 * z + 72 * 1.110745862 = 139
24 * z + 79.97343222 = 139
24 * z = 59.02656778
z = 59.02656778 / 24
z = 2.459440324
### Answer: y = 1.110745862, z = 2.459440324

            Solve the following system of equations for the variables v and o: (87 * o) - (29 * v) = 1 and (8 * v) + (30 * o) = 91.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the second equation by 29 to make the coefficients of v in both equations equal:
(87 * o) - (29 * v) = 1
(232 * v) + (870 * o) = 2639
Next, we can add the two equations to eliminate v:
(87 * o) - (29 * v) + (232 * v) + (870 * o) = 1 + 2639
(957 * o) + (203 * v) = 2640
Now, we can solve for o:
o = (2640 - 203 * v) / 957
Substituting this expression for o into the first equation, we can solve for v:
(87 * ((2640 - 203 * v) / 957)) - (29 * v) = 1
Simplifying this equation, we get:
(230880 - 17701 * v) / 957 - 29 * v = 1
Multiplying both sides by 957, we get:
230880 - 17701 * v - 27753 * v = 957
Combining like terms, we get:
-45454 * v = -229923
Dividing both sides by -45454, we get:
v = 5
Substituting this value of v back into the expression for o, we get:
o = (2640 - 203 * 5) / 957
o = 2

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's solve the system of equations step by step. We have:
(23 * h) - (46 * p) = 58
(11 * p) + (23 * h) = 124

First, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of h the same in both equations:
(23 * h) - (46 * p) = 58
(22 * p) + (46 * h) = 248

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate h:
(22 * p) + (46 * h) - ((23 * h) - (46 * p)) = 248 - 58
(22 * p) + (46 * h) - (23 * h) + (46 * p) = 190
(68 * p) + (23 * h) = 190

Now, we can substitute the value of (23 * h) from the first equation into the new equation:
(68 * p) + 58 = 190
(68 * p) = 132
p = 132 / 68
p = 1.9411764705882353

Now, we can substitute the value of p back into one of the original equations to solve for h. Let's use the second equation:
(11 * p) + (23 * h) = 124
(11 * 1.9411764705882353) + (23 * h) = 124
21.352941176470588 + (23 * h) = 124
(23 * h) = 102.64705882352941
h = 102.64705882352941 / 23
h = 4.463

A system of linear equations is given by the following formulas:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we will multiply the first equation by 52 and the second equation by 55 to make the coefficients of 'r' in both equations equal:

1) 42 * m + 55 * r = 127 =&gt; 2184 * m + 2860 * r = 6604
2) 66 * m - 52 * r = 44 =&gt; 3630 * m - 2860 * r = 2420

Now, we will add the two equations to eliminate 'r':

2184 * m + 2860 * r + 3630 * m - 2860 * r = 6604 + 2420
5814 * m = 9024
m = 9024 / 5814
m = 1.55

Now, we will substitute the value of 'm' in the first equation to find the value of 'r':

42 * 1.55 + 55 * r = 127
65.1 + 55 * r = 127
55 * r = 127 - 65.1
55 * r = 61.9
r = 61.9 / 55
r = 1.125

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 71 and the second equation by 31 to make the coefficients of n the same:

71(31n + 64w) = 71(120)

31(57w + 71n) = 31(173)

Simplifying these equations, we get:

2201n + 4544w = 8520

1767w + 2201n = 5363

Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate n:

(2201n + 4544w) - (1767w + 2201n) = 8520 - 5363

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2777w = 3157

Dividing both sides by 2777, we get:

w = 1.136

Now that we have the value of w, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for n. Let's use the first equation:

31n + 64(1.136) = 120

Simplifying this equation, we get:

31n + 72.96 = 120

Subtracting 72.96 from both sides, we get:

31n = 47.04

Dividing both sides by 31, we get:

n = 1.517

Therefore, the values of n and w that satisfy the system of linear equations simultaneously are n = 1.517 and w = 1.136.

First, we can multiply equation (1) by 76 and equation (2) by 26 to make the coefficients of u in both equations equal:

76 * (72 * a + 26 * u) = 76 * 112
26 * (76 * u - 77 * a) = 26 * 31

This gives us:

5472 * a + 1976 * u = 8432
1976 * u - 2002 * a = 806

Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate u:

(5472 * a + 1976 * u) - (1976 * u - 2002 * a) = 8432 - 806
5472 * a + 1976 * u - 1976 * u + 2002 * a = 7626
7474 * a = 7626

Now, we can solve for a:

a = 7626 / 7474
a = 1.02

Now that we have the value of a, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to solve for u. Let's use equation (1):

72 * 1.02 + 26 * u = 112
73.44 + 26 * u = 112
26 * u = 112 - 73.44
26 * u = 38.56
u = 38.56 / 26

Here, we'll use elimination to make the coefficients of p the same in both equations. Multiply the first equation by 88 and the second equation by 7 to align the coefficients of p:

(53 * e + 7 * p) * 88 = 103 * 88
(69 * e - 88 * p) * 7 = 6 * 7

This gives us:
4664 * e + 616 * p = 9064
483 * e - 616 * p = 42

Adding these two equations to eliminate p, we get:
5147 * e = 9106

Solving for e, we find:
e = 9106 / 5147 = &lt;&lt;9106/5147=1.766&gt;&gt;1.766 (approximately)

Substituting e back into one of the original equations to solve for p, we use the first equation:
53 * 1.766 + 7 * p = 103
93.598 + 7 * p = 103
7 * p = 103 - 93.598

First equation: 432 * p - 168 * s = 504
Second equation: 918 * s - 432 * p = 252

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate the variable p:

(432 * p - 168 * s) + (-432 * p + 918 * s) = 504 + 252

Simplifying this equation, we get:

750 * s = 756

Dividing both sides by 750, we get:

s = 756 / 750 = 1.008

Now that we have the value of s, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for p. Let's use the first equation:

(18 * p) - (7 * 1.008) = 21

Simplifying this equation, we get:

18 * p - 7.056 = 21

Adding 7.056 to both sides, we get:

18 * p = 28.056

Dividing both sides by 18, we get:

p = 28.056 / 18 = 1.5586666666666667

Therefore, the values of p and s that satisfy both equations are:

p = 1.5586666666666667
s = 1.008
### Answer: p = 1.5586666666666667, s = 1.008

42 * (45 * f + 42 * z) = 42 * 101,
45 * (60 * z - 42 * f) = 45 * 13.

Simplify the equations:
1890 * f + 1764 * z = 4242,
2700 * z - 1890 * f = 585.

Add the two equations to eliminate f:
1764 * z + 2700 * z = 4242 + 585,
4464 * z = 4827.

Divide both sides by 4464 to solve for z:
z = 4827 / 4464,
z = 1.08.

Substitute z = 1.08 into the first equation to solve for f:
45 * f + 42 * 1.08 = 101,
45 * f + 45.36 = 101.

Subtract 45.36 from both sides:
45 * f = 101 - 45.36,
45 * f = 55.64.

Divide both sides by 45 to solve for f:

Simplify the equations:

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate p:
(390 * p + 1508 * u) - (390 * p - 315 * u) = 2158 - 90

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve for n and s, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the second equation by 38/8 to make the coefficient of s in both equations the same:

(59 * n + 8 * s) * (38/8) = 75 * (38/8)
(59 * n * 38/8) + (8 * s * 38/8) = 75 * (38/8)
(59 * n * 38/8) + 38 * s = 75 * (38/8)

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate s:

(59 * n * 38/8) + 38 * s - (92 * n - 38 * s) = 75 * (38/8) - 62
(59 * n * 38/8) - 92 * n = 75 * (38/8) - 62
(59 * n * 38/8) - 92 * n = 3450/8 - 62
(59 * n * 38/8) - 92 * n = 3450/8 - 496/8
(59 * n * 38/8) - 92 * n = 2954/8
(59 * n * 38/8) - 92 * n = 369.25

Now, we can solve for n:

(59 * n * 38/8) - 92 * n = 369.25
(59 * n * 38/8) = 92 * n + 369.25
(59 * n * 38/8) = 92 * n + 369.25
(59 * n * 38/8) - 92 * n = 369.25
(59 * n * 38/8) - 92 * n = 369.25
(59 * n * 38/8) - 92 * n = 369.25
(59 * n * 38/8) - 92 * n = 369.25
(59 * n * 38/8) - 92 * n = 369.25

58 * (87 * z - 35 * e) = 58 * 63
35 * (81 * z + 58 * e) = 35 * 154

This gives us:
5046 * z - 1990 * e = 3654
2835 * z + 2030 * e = 5390

Now, we'll add the two equations to eliminate e:
(5046 * z - 1990 * e) + (2835 * z + 2030 * e) = 3654 + 5390
7881 * z = 9044

Now, we'll solve for z:
z = 9044 / 7881
z = &lt;&lt;9044/7881=1.1475&gt;&gt;1.1475

Next, we'll substitute the value of z back into one of the original equations to solve for e. Using the first equation:
87 * 1.1475 - 35 * e = 63
99.9375 - 35 * e = 63

Now, we'll solve for e:
35 * e = 99.9375 - 63
35 * e = 36.9375
e = 36.9375 / 35

First, we can multiply the first equation by 36 and the second equation by 44 to make the coefficients of h the same:

(36 * 11 * t) + (36 * 44 * h) = 36 * 110
(44 * 98 * t) - (44 * 36 * h) = 44 * 18

This simplifies to:

396 * t + 1584 * h = 3960
4312 * t - 1584 * h = 792

Next, we can add the two equations together to eliminate h:

(396 * t) + (4312 * t) = 3960 + 792
4708 * t = 4752

Now, we can solve for t:

t = 4752 / 4708
t = 1

Now that we have the value of t, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for h. Let's use the first equation:

(11 * 1) + (44 * h) = 110

First, we can multiply the second equation by 16 to make the coefficients of q in both equations equal:

Next, we can add the two equations to eliminate p:

Dividing both sides by 163, we get:
q = 17.77.
Substituting this value of q into the second equation, we get:
6 * 17.77 + 5 * p = 177.

106.62 + 5 * p = 177.
Subtracting 106.62 from both sides, we get:
5 * p = 70.38.
Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
p = 14.076.
Therefore, the values of p and q are p = 14.076 and q = 17.77.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 41 and the second equation by 48 to make the coefficients of f the same:
410 * k + 1968 * f = 6581
1584 * k - 1968 * f = 1488
Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate f:
2094 * k = 8069
k = 8069 / 2094 = &lt;&lt;8069/2094=3.85&gt;&gt;3.85
Now that we have the value of k, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of f:
10 * 3.85 + 48 * f = 161
38.5 + 48 * f = 161
48 * f = 122.5
f = 122.5 / 48 = &lt;&lt;122.5/48=2.55&gt;&gt;2.55

First, we can solve the first equation for n: n = 58 * l - 31
Then, we can substitute this expression for n into the second equation: 103 = (58 * l - 31) + 73 * l
Simplifying the equation, we get: 103 = 131 * l - 31
Adding 31 to both sides, we get: 134 = 131 * l
Dividing both sides by 131, we get: l = 134 / 131 = &lt;&lt;134/131=1.023&gt;&gt;1.023

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 37 and the second equation by 28 to make the coefficients of j equal:

37(29y - 28j) = 37(39)
28(25y + 37j) = 28(116)

This gives us:

1073y - 1036j = 1443
700y + 1036j = 3248

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate j:

1073y + 700y = 1443 + 3248
1773y = 4691

Dividing both sides by 1773, we get:

y = 4691 / 1773
y = 2.64

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of j. Let's use the first equation:

29(2.64) - 28j = 39
76.56 - 28j = 39

Subtracting 76.56 from both sides, we get:

-28j = 39 - 76.56
-28j = -37.56

Dividing both sides by -28, we get:

j = -37.56 / -28
j = 1.34

Therefore, the values of y and j that satisfy the system of equations are y = 2.64 and j = 1.34.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 17 and the second equation by 85 to make the coefficients of a in both equations equal:

17*(93u - 85a) = 17*74 
85*(96u + 17a) = 85*186

This gives us:

1581u - 1445a = 1258 
8160u + 1445a = 15810

Adding these two equations, we get:

9741u = 17068

Dividing both sides by 9741, we get:

u = 17068/9741 = 1.75

Substituting this value of u into the first equation, we get:

93*1.75 - 85a = 74

First, we can multiply the first equation by 23 and the second equation by 61 to make the coefficients of g the same:

23 * (97 * u - 61 * g) = 23 * 15
61 * (85 * u + 23 * g) = 61 * 186

This gives us:

2231 * u - 1403 * g = 345

Now, we can add these two equations to eliminate g:

2231 * u + 5185 * u = 345 + 11346
7416 * u = 11691

Now, we can solve for u:

u = 11691 / 7416
u = 1.576

Now that we have the value of u, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of g. Let's use the first equation:

97 * 1.576 - 61 * g = 15
152.872 - 61 * g = 15
-61 * g = 15 - 152.872
-61 * g = -137.872

Now, we can solve for g:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, we'll multiply the first equation by 30 and the second equation by 54 to make the coefficients of n equal:

1. (30 * 85 * n) - (30 * 54 * t) = 30 * 41
2. (54 * 38 * t) + (54 * 30 * n) = 54 * 126

This simplifies to:

1. 2550n - 1620t = 1230
2. 2052t + 1620n = 6744

Next, we'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate n:

2052t + 1620n - (2550n - 1620t) = 6744 - 1230

This simplifies to:

3672t = 5514

Now, we can solve for t:

t = 5514 / 3672
t = 1.5

Substitute t = 1.5 into the first original equation to solve for n:

(85 * n) - (54 * 1.5) = 41
85n - 81 = 41
85n = 122

1) From the first equation, we have:
75u - 69q = 5

2) From the second equation, we have:
48u + 25q = 140

3) To eliminate q, we can multiply the first equation by 25 and the second equation by 69:
(75u - 69q) * 25 = 5 * 25
(48u + 25q) * 69 = 140 * 69

4) This gives us:
1875u - 1725q = 125
3312u + 1725q = 9660

5) Adding these two equations, we get:

6) Solving for u, we have:
u = 9785 / 5187 = 1.886

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 91 and the second equation by 41 to make the coefficients of g in both equations equal:

39 * t * 91 + 41 * g * 91 = 147 * 91
94 * t * 41 - 91 * g * 41 = 42 * 41

This simplifies to:

3549 * t + 3731 * g = 13377
3854 * t - 3731 * g = 1722

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate g:

3549 * t + 3731 * g + 3854 * t - 3731 * g = 13377 + 1722
7403 * t = 15109

Now, we can solve for t:

t = 15109 / 7403
t = &lt;&lt;15109/7403=2.04&gt;&gt;2.04

Now that we have the value of t, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for g. Let's use the first equation:

39 * t + 41 * g = 147
39 * 2.04 + 41 * g = 147
79.56 + 41 * g = 147

Now, we can solve for g:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination for this problem. First, we can multiply the first equation by 55 and the second equation by 6 to make the coefficients of c the same:
55(6c + 55o) = 55(112)
6(55c - 48o) = 6(36)
This simplifies to:
330c + 3025o = 6160
330c - 288o = 216
Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate c:
(330c + 3025o) - (330c - 288o) = 6160 - 216
3025o + 288o = 5944
3313o = 5944
o = 5944 / 3313
o = 1.794 (approximately)
Now, we can substitute the value of o back into one of the original equations to solve for c. Let's use the first equation:
6c + 55(1.794) = 112
6c + 98.67 = 112
6c = 112 - 98.67
6c = 13.33
c = 13.33 / 6
c = 2.2217 (approximately)

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 38 and the second equation by 68 to make the coefficients of r the same:

(68*r + 8*f) * 38 = 92 * 38
(97*f + 38*r) * 68 = 182 * 68

This gives us:

2584*r + 304*f = 3496
6616*f + 2584*r = 12376

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate r:

(6616*f + 2584*r) - (2584*r + 304*f) = 12376 - 3496

This simplifies to:

6312*f = 8880

Now, we can solve for f:

f = 8880 / 6312
f = 1.4

Now that we have the value of f, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for r. Let's use the first equation:

68*r + 8*1.4 = 92

This simplifies to:

68*r + 11.2 = 92

Now, we can solve for r:

68*r = 92 - 11.2
68*r = 80.8
r = 80.8 / 68
r = 1.19

For the first equation, consider 67 apples, each worth d dollars, and 37 ragdolls, each worth r dollars. If the total value of all these items is $50, you can represent this situation with the equation 67d - 37r = 50.

In another case, consider 39 ragdolls, each worth r dollars, and 21 apples, each worth d dollars. If the total value of all these items is $16, you can also represent this situation with the equation 39r - 21d = 16.

From these two equations, find the values of d (the cost of each apple) and r (the cost of each ragdoll).

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 39 and the second equation by 67 to make the coefficients of r in both equations equal:

39(67d - 37r) = 39(50)
67(39r - 21d) = 67(16)

This gives us:

2613d - 1443r = 1950
2613r - 1407d = 1072

Now, we can add these two equations to eliminate r:

(2613d - 1443r) + (2613r - 1407d) = 1950 + 1072
2613d - 1407d = 3022
1206d = 3022
d = 3022/1206
d = 2.5

Now that we have the value of d, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of r. Let's use the first equation:

67d - 37r = 50
67(2.5) - 37r = 50
167.5 - 37r = 50
-37r = 50 - 167.5
-37r = -117.5
r = -117.5/-37
r = 3.175675675675676

First, we'll multiply the first equation by 84 to align the coefficients of a:

Now, we'll add this to the second equation to eliminate a:
13752 + 24 = 4200x + 84a + 98x - 84a
13776 = 4298x

Solving for x:
x = 13776 / 4298 = &lt;&lt;13776/4298=3.2&gt;&gt;3.2

Add the two equations to eliminate p:

b = 8656 / 6286
b = 1.375

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 51 and the second equation by 29 to make the coefficients of p the same:

51 * (26 * x + 29 * p) = 51 * 107 

29 * (61 * x - 51 * p) = 29 * 4

This gives us:

1326 * x + 1519 * p = 5457 

1769 * x - 1479 * p = 116

Next, we can add the two equations together to eliminate p:

1326 * x + 1519 * p + 1769 * x - 1479 * p = 5457 + 116

This simplifies to:

3095 * x = 5573

Dividing both sides by 3095 gives us:

x = 5573 / 3095 = &lt;&lt;5573/3095=1.8&gt;&gt;1.8

Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for p. Using the first equation:

26 * 1.8 + 29 * p = 107

46.8 + 29 * p = 107

Subtracting 46.8 from both sides gives us:

29 * p = 60.2

Dividing both sides by 29 gives us:

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Multiply the first equation by 24 and the second equation by 33 to eliminate a:

24*(33*a - 54*c) = 24*20 
33*(24*a - 26*c) = 33*29

Simplify:

792*a - 1296*c = 480 
792*a - 858*c = 957

Subtract the second equation from the first:

(792*a - 1296*c) - (792*a - 858*c) = 480 - 957
-438*c = -477

Divide by -438:

c = 477/438 = 1.089

Substitute c = 1.089 into the first equation:

33*a - 54*1.089 = 20
33*a - 58.806 = 20
33*a = 78.806
a = 78.806/33 = 2.388

            Kat found herself stuck solving the following system of equations with two variables, d and j. Can you help her resolve it?

71d + 9j = 132

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 84 and the second equation by 71 to make the coefficients of d the same:

84(71d + 9j) = 84(132)
71(43j - 84d) = 71(91)

This gives us:

5964d + 756j = 11088
3053j - 5964d = 6461

Now, we can add these two equations to eliminate d:

5964d + 756j + 3053j - 5964d = 11088 + 6461

This simplifies to:

3809j = 17549

Now, we can solve for j:

j = 17549 / 3809
j = 4.608

Next, we can substitute the value of j back into one of the original equations to solve for d. Let's use the first equation:

71d + 9(4.608) = 132

This simplifies to:

71d + 41.472 = 132

Now, we can solve for d:

71d = 132 - 41.472
71d = 90.528

d = 90.528 / 71
d = 1.275

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is d = 1.275 and j = 4.608.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's solve this system of equations using the substitution method. First, we can solve the first equation for o:

o = (163 - 26n) / 81

Next, we can substitute this expression for o into the second equation:

87n + 23((163 - 26n) / 81) = 143

Multiplying both sides by 81 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

7047n + 3749 - 598n = 11583

Combining like terms, we get:

6449n = 7834

Dividing both sides by 6449, we get:

n = 7834 / 6449 = 1.214

Substituting this value of n back into the expression for o, we get:

o = (163 - 26(1.214)) / 81 = 1.506

Therefore, the values of o and n are approximately 1.506 and 1.214, respectively.

Simplify:

2796 * s - 3721 * w = 122
2806 * s + 3082 * w = 8188

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate s:

(2806 * s + 3082 * w) - (2796 * s - 3721 * w) = 8188 - 122

Simplify:

10 * s + 6803 * w = 8066

Divide by 10:

s + 680.3 * w = 806.6

Substitute s = 806.6 - 680.3 * w into the first equation:

46 * (806.6 - 680.3 * w) - 61 * w = 2

Simplify:

37097.6 - 31293.8 * w - 61 * w = 2

Combine like terms:

-31354.8 * w = -37095.6

Divide by -31354.8:

w = 1.183

Substitute w = 1.183 into the equation s = 806.6 - 680.3 * w:

s = 806.6 - 680.3 * 1.183

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination.

First, we'll multiply equation 1 by 29 and equation 2 by 8 to make the coefficients of 'f' the same:

1) (29 * 8 * f) + (29 * 39 * h) = 29 * 66

2) (8 * 29 * f) + (8 * 46 * h) = 8 * 119

Simplifying, we get:

1) 232f + 1131h = 1914

2) 232f + 368h = 952

Now, we'll subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate 'f':

(232f + 1131h) - (232f + 368h) = 1914 - 952

Simplifying, we get:

763h = 962

Dividing both sides by 763, we get:

h = 962 / 763 = 1.26

Now, we can substitute the value of 'h' back into one of the original equations to solve for 'f'. Let's use equation 1:

(8 * f) + (39 * 1.26) = 66

Simplifying, we get:

8f + 49.14 = 66

Subtracting 49.14 from both sides, we get:

8f = 16.86

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

f = 16.86 / 8 = 2.11

Now, we can add the two equations together to eliminate b: (66 * b + 69 * k) + (62 * k - 69 * b) = 327 + 14, which simplifies to 131 * k = 341. Dividing both sides by 131 gives us k = 341 / 131 = 2.6. Substituting k = 2.6 into the first equation gives us 22 * b + 23 * 2.6 = 109, which simplifies to 22 * b + 59.8 = 109. Subtracting 59.8 from both sides gives us 22 * b = 49.2, and dividing both sides by 22 gives us b = 49.2 / 22 = 2.2.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 55 to make the coefficients of s the same:

1. 168m - 110s = 2
2. 3465m - 110s = 5390

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate s:

3465m - 168m = 5390 - 2
3297m = 5388

Now, we can solve for m:

m = 5388 / 3297
m = 1.63

Next, we can substitute the value of m back into one of the original equations to solve for s. Let's use the first equation:

84(1.63) - 55s = 1
136.92 - 55s = 1
-55s = 1 - 136.92
-55s = -135.92

Now, we can solve for s:

s = -135.92 / -55
s = 2.47

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is m = 1.63 and s = 2.47.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we'll use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 51 and the second equation by 6 to make the coefficients of b the same:

1. (51 * 6 * b) + (51 * 5 * k) = 51 * 105
2. (6 * 95 * k) - (6 * 51 * b) = 6 * 67

This simplifies to:

1. 306b + 255k = 5355
2. 570k - 306b = 402

Now, we can add these two equations to eliminate b:

306b + 255k + 570k - 306b = 5355 + 402

This simplifies to:

825k = 5757

Now, we can solve for k:

k = 5757 / 825
k = 7

Next, we can substitute the value of k back into one of the original equations to solve for b. Let's use the first equation:

(6 * b) + (5 * 7) = 105

This simplifies to:

6b + 35 = 105

Now, we can solve for b:

6b = 105 - 35
6b = 70
b = 70 / 6
b = 11.666...

Since b must be a whole number (as it represents the number of items), we can round b to the nearest whole number, which is 12.

            Determine the values of d and u from the following pair of simultaneous linear equations: 

33d + 62u = 114 and
32u + 40d = 83.

            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 72B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 
First, we can solve for d in terms of u using the first equation:
33d = 114 - 62u
d = (114 - 62u) / 33

Next, we can substitute this expression for d into the second equation:
32u + 40((114 - 62u) / 33) = 83

Simplifying this equation, we get:
32u + (40 * 114) / 33 - (40 * 62u) / 33 = 83
32u + 1360 / 33 - 2480u / 33 = 83
32u - 2480u / 33 = 83 - 1360 / 33
(32u * 33) - 2480u = (83 * 33) - 1360
1056u - 2480u = 2739 - 1360
-1424u = 1379
u = -1379 / 1424

Now that we have the value of u, we can substitute it back into the expression for d:
d = (114 - 62(-1379 / 1424)) / 33
d = (114 + 85618 / 1424) / 33
d = (114 * 1424 + 85618) / (33 * 1424)
d = (162456 + 85618) / 46992
d = 248074 / 46992
d = 5.28

Therefore, the values of d and u are d = 5.28 and u = -1379 / 1424.

            There are two equations below that contain the variables c and p. Can you solve this system of equations to find the values of c and p?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's solve this system of equations using the substitution method. First, we can solve the first equation for c:

5 * c + 28 * p = 102
5 * c = 102 - 28 * p
c = (102 - 28 * p) / 5

Now, we can substitute this expression for c into the second equation:

20 * c - 67 * p = 13
20 * ((102 - 28 * p) / 5) - 67 * p = 13
4 * (102 - 28 * p) - 67 * p = 13
408 - 112 * p - 67 * p = 13
408 - 179 * p = 13
-179 * p = 13 - 408
-179 * p = -395
p = -395 / -179
p = 2.2

Now that we have the value of p, we can substitute it back into the expression for c:

c = (102 - 28 * p) / 5
c = (102 - 28 * 2.2) / 5
c = (102 - 61.6) / 5
c = 40.4 / 5
c = 8.08

58 * r = 147 - 12 * q
r = (147 - 12 * q) / 58
Now, we can substitute this expression for r into the second equation:
97 * q - 76 * ((147 - 12 * q) / 58) = 76
Simplifying this equation, we get:
97 * q - (147 * 76 / 58) + (12 * 76 * q / 58) = 76
97 * q - 186 + 152 * q / 7 = 76
Multiplying both sides by 7 to eliminate the fraction, we get:
679 * q - 1302 + 152 * q = 532
Combining like terms, we get:
831 * q = 1834
Dividing both sides by 831, we get:
q = 1834 / 831
q = 2.206
Now, we can substitute this value of q back into the expression for r:
r = (147 - 12 * 2.206) / 58
r = (147 - 26.472) / 58

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's solve the system of equations step by step.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 27 and the second equation by 89 to eliminate p:
27*(89p - 41q) = 27*60
89*(27p + 91q) = 89*124
This gives us:
2393p - 1107q = 1620
2403p + 8099q = 11036
Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:
10p + 9206q = 9416
Solving for p gives:
p = (9416 - 9206q)/10
Substituting this into the first equation gives:
89*((9416 - 9206q)/10) - 41q = 60
Simplifying this gives:
84744 - 81954q - 410q = 600
Solving for q gives:
q = (84744 - 600)/(81954 + 410) = 1
Substituting q = 1 into the equation for p gives:
p = (9416 - 9206*1)/10 = 21

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

First, we can multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of d in both equations the same:

(81 * u) + (108 * d) = 213

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate d:

(81 * u) + (108 * d) - ((88 * u) - (96 * d)) = 213 - 12

Simplifying this, we get:

(81 * u) + (108 * d) - (88 * u) + (96 * d) = 201

Combining like terms, we get:

(81 * u - 88 * u) + (108 * d + 96 * d) = 201

-7 * u + 204 * d = 201

Now, we can solve for u:

u = (201 - 204 * d) / -7

Substituting this expression for u into the first equation, we get:

(88 * ((201 - 204 * d) / -7)) - (96 * d) = 12

Simplifying this, we get:

(88 * (201 - 204 * d)) / -7 - 96 * d = 12

Multiplying both sides by -7 to get rid of the fraction, we get:

88 * (201 - 204 * d) - 672 * d = -84

Expanding this, we get:

17728 - 17952 * d - 672 * d = -84

Combining like terms, we get:

17728 - 18624 * d = -84

Now, we can solve for d:

d = (17728 + 84) / 18624

d = 17812 / 18624

d = 0.956

Substituting this value of d back into the expression for u, we get:

u = (201 - 204 * 0.956) / -7

u = (201 - 194.904) / -7

u = 6.096 / -7

u = -0.871

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 68 and the second equation by 11 to make the coefficients of w equal:

11(66u - 68w) = 11(21)
Simplifying these equations, we get:
5032u + 748w = 7888
726u - 748w = 231
Next, we can add these two equations to eliminate w:
(5032u + 748w) + (726u - 748w) = 7888 + 231

Now that we have the value of u, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for w. Let's use the first equation:
74(1.41) + 11w = 116
104.34 + 11w = 116
Subtracting 104.34 from both sides, we get:
11w = 11.66
Dividing both sides by 11, we get:
w = 1.06
Therefore, the values of u and w that satisfy the system of equations are u = 1.41 and w = 1.06.
### Answer: u = 1.41, w = 1.06

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 34 and the second equation by 42 to make the coefficients of f the same:
34 * (76 * f - 42 * j) = 34 * 96
42 * (47 * j + 34 * f) = 42 * 136
This gives us:
2584 * f - 1428 * j = 3264
1974 * j + 1428 * f = 5712
Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate f:
1974 * j + 1428 * f - (2584 * f - 1428 * j) = 5712 - 3264
This simplifies to:
3402 * j = 2448
Dividing both sides by 3402 gives us:
j = 2448 / 3402 = &lt;&lt;2448/3402=0.72&gt;&gt;0.72
Now that we have the value of j, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find the value of f. Let's use the first equation:
76 * f - 42 * 0.72 = 96
This simplifies to:
76 * f - 30.24 = 96
Adding 30.24 to both sides gives us:
76 * f = 126.24
Dividing both sides by 76 gives us:
f = 126.24 / 76 = &lt;&lt;126.24/76=1.66&gt;&gt;1.66
Therefore, the values of f and j that will satisfy the system of equations are f = 1.66 and j = 0.72.

63(68u + 32e) = 63(174)
68(63e - 69u) = 68(1)
Simplifying, we get:
4284u + 2016e = 10962
4284e - 4692u = 68

e = 11030/6300 = &lt;&lt;11030/6300=1.75&gt;&gt;1.75
Substituting e = 1.75 into the first equation, we get:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's solve the system of linear equations by substitution. First, we can solve the first equation for p:

57p + 4n = 129
57p = 129 - 4n
p = (129 - 4n) / 57

Now, we can substitute this expression for p into the second equation:

24p + 39n = 154
24((129 - 4n) / 57) + 39n = 154
(3096 - 96n) / 57 + 39n = 154
3096 - 96n + 2223n = 8778
2127n = 5682
n = 5682 / 2127
n = 2.67

Now, we can substitute this value of n back into the expression for p:

p = (129 - 4n) / 57
p = (129 - 4(2.67)) / 57
p = (129 - 10.68) / 57
p = 118.32 / 57
p = 2.075

Therefore, the values of p and n that satisfy the system of linear equations are p = 2.075 and n = 2.67.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 14 and the second equation by 44 to make the coefficients of z in both equations equal:

14 * (66 * z - 44 * y) = 14 * 32
44 * (60 * y + 14 * z) = 44 * 116

This gives us:

924 * z - 616 * y = 448
2640 * y + 616 * z = 5104

Next, we can add the two equations together to eliminate z:

924 * z - 616 * y + 2640 * y + 616 * z = 448 + 5104

This simplifies to:

3564 * y = 5552

Dividing both sides by 3564 gives us:

y = 5552 / 3564 = 1.56

Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for z. Using the first equation:

66 * z - 44 * 1.56 = 32

Simplifying:

66 * z - 68.64 = 32

Adding 68.64 to both sides:

66 * z = 100.64

Dividing both sides by 66:

z = 100.64 / 66 = 1.52

Therefore, the values of y and z are:

y = 1.56
z = 1.52

First, we can multiply the first equation by 11 and the second equation by 83 to make the coefficients of t the same:

11 * (83 * t - 58 * h) = 11 * 45
83 * (69 * h + 11 * t) = 83 * 124

This gives us:

913 * t - 638 * h = 495
5707 * h + 913 * t = 10292

Next, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate t:

5707 * h + 913 * t - (913 * t - 638 * h) = 10292 - 495

This simplifies to:

6345 * h = 9797

Now, we can solve for h:

h = 9797 / 6345
h = 1.54

Next, we can substitute the value of h back into one of the original equations to solve for t. Let's use the first equation:

83 * t - 58 * 1.54 = 45

This simplifies to:

83 * t - 89.32 = 45

Now, we can solve for t:

83 * t = 134.32
t = 134.32 / 83
t = 1.62

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is t = 1.62 and h = 1.54.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination.
First, we can multiply the second equation by 61/16 to make the coefficients of h in both equations equal:
((79 * h) - (61 * o)) = 9
((61 * (16 * h) - 61 * (12 * o)) = 61 * 9
Simplifying the second equation gives us:
((61 * 16 * h) - (61 * 12 * o)) = 549
Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate h:
((61 * 16 * h) - (61 * 12 * o)) - ((79 * h) - (61 * o)) = 549 - 9
Simplifying this gives us:
((61 * 16 * h) - (79 * h) - (61 * 12 * o) + (61 * o)) = 540
((976 * h) - (79 * h) - (732 * o) + (61 * o)) = 540
((897 * h) - (671 * o)) = 540
Now, we can solve for o:
o = ((897 * h) - 540) / 671
Substituting this expression for o into the first equation gives us:
((79 * h) - (61 * ((897 * h) - 540) / 671)) = 9
Simplifying this gives us:
((79 * h) - ((61 * 897 * h) - (61 * 540)) / 671) = 9
((79 * h) - ((54627 * h) - (32940)) / 671) = 9
((79 * h) - (54627 * h) / 671 + (32940) / 671) = 9
((79 * h) - (81.42 * h) + 49.09) = 9
((79 * h) - (81.42 * h)) = 9 - 49.09
((-2.42 * h)) = -40.09
h = -40.09 / -2.42
h = 16.57
Substituting this value of h back into the expression for o gives us:
o = ((897 * 16.57) - 540) / 671
o = (14821.49 - 540) / 671

90 * (4 * y + 56 * s) = 90 * 139
56 * (65 * y - 90 * s) = 56 * 16

This gives us:

360 * y + 5040 * s = 12510
3640 * y - 5040 * s = 896

Now, we can add these two equations to eliminate s:

360 * y + 3640 * y + 5040 * s - 5040 * s = 12510 + 896
4000 * y = 13406

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 13406 / 4000
y = 3.3515

Now that we have y, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for s. We'll use the first equation:

4 * 3.3515 + 56 * s = 139
13.406 + 56 * s = 139

First, we can multiply the first equation by 45 and the second equation by 4 to make the coefficients of z the same:

45 * (42 * d - 4 * z) = 45 * 75
4 * (40 * d + 45 * z) = 4 * 162

This gives us:

1890 * d - 180 * z = 3375
160 * d + 180 * z = 648

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate z:

1890 * d + 160 * d = 3375 + 648
2050 * d = 4023

Dividing both sides by 2050 gives us:

d = 4023 / 2050
d = 1.962439024390244

Now that we have the value of d, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find z. Using the first equation:

42 * d - 4 * z = 75
42 * 1.962439024390244 - 4 * z = 75

Solving for z gives us:

82.42243902439024 - 4 * z = 75

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Let's solve the system of equations step by step. First, we can multiply the second equation by 4 to make the coefficients of 'o' in both equations equal: (42 * o) + (24 * a) = 142
 (168 * a) + (24 * o) = 300. Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate 'o': (168 * a) + (24 * o) - ((42 * o) + (24 * a)) = 300 - 142
 (126 * a) = 158. Now, we can solve for 'a': a = 158 / 126
 a = 1.25. Now, we can substitute the value of 'a' into one of the original equations to solve for 'o': (42 * o) + (24 * 1.25) = 142
 (42 * o) + 30 = 142
 (42 * o) = 112
 o = 112 / 42
 o = 2.67. Therefore, the values of 'a' and 'o' are 1.25 and 2.67, respectively.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 84 and the second equation by 39 to make the coefficients of r equal:
84*(39*r - 2*p) = 84*45
39*(16*p - 84*r) = 39*36
Simplifying these equations, we get:
3276*r - 168*p = 3780
624*p - 3276*r = 1404
Adding these two equations, we get:
456*p = 5184
Dividing both sides by 456, we get:
p = 11.368421052631579
Substituting this value of p into the first equation, we get:
39*r - 2*11.368421052631579 = 45
Simplifying this equation, we get:
39*r = 67.73684210526316
Dividing both sides by 39, we get:

First, we can multiply the first equation by 8 and the second equation by 23 to make the coefficients of 'd' in both equations equal:

1. (184 * d) - (416 * w) = 56
2. (1472 * w) - (184 * d) = 1334

Next, we can add the two equations to eliminate 'd':

(184 * d) - (416 * w) + (1472 * w) - (184 * d) = 56 + 1334
1056 * w = 1390

Now, we can solve for 'w':

w = 1390 / 1056
w = 1.316

Substituting the value of 'w' back into one of the original equations, we can solve for 'd':

(23 * d) - (52 * 1.316) = 7
(23 * d) - 68.432 = 7
23 * d = 75.432

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Multiply the first equation by 47 and the second equation by 60 to eliminate n:

(71 * z * 47) + (60 * n * 47) = 184 * 47 
(52 * z * 60) - (47 * n * 60) = 19 * 60

Simplify:

3337 * z + 2820 * n = 8648 
3120 * z - 2820 * n = 1140

Add the two equations to eliminate n:

(3337 * z) + (3120 * z) = 8648 + 1140 
6457 * z = 9788

Divide both sides by 6457:

z = 9788 / 6457 
z = 1.516

Substitute z = 1.516 into the first equation:

(71 * 1.516) + (60 * n) = 184 
107.736 + 60 * n = 184

Subtract 107.736 from both sides:

60 * n = 184 - 107.736 
60 * n = 76.264

Divide both sides by 60:

n = 76.264 / 60 
n = 1.271

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the first equation by 84 and the second equation by 70 to make the coefficients of e in both equations equal:

84 * (70 * e + 90 * z) = 84 * 189 
70 * (99 * z - 84 * e) = 70 * 20

This simplifies to:

5880 * e + 7560 * z = 15876 
6930 * z - 5880 * e = 1400

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate the e term:

(5880 * e + 7560 * z) + (6930 * z - 5880 * e) = 15876 + 1400
7560 * z + 6930 * z = 17276
14490 * z = 17276

Dividing both sides by 14490, we get:

z = 17276 / 14490
z = 1.192

Now that we have the value of z, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for e. Let's use the first equation:

70 * e + 90 * 1.192 = 189
70 * e + 107.28 = 189
70 * e = 189 - 107.28
70 * e = 81.72

Dividing both sides by 70, we get:

e = 81.72 / 70
e = 1.167

Therefore, the values of e and z are:

e = 1.167
z = 1.192

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply equation 1 by 11 and equation 2 by 26 to make the coefficients of o the same:

1) 286o - 484f = 1045
2) 2262f + 286o = 4394

Now, we can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate o:

2262f + 286o - (286o - 484f) = 4394 - 1045
2262f + 286o - 286o + 484f = 3349
2746f = 3349

Now, we can solve for f:

f = 3349 / 2746
f = 1.22

Next, we can substitute the value of f back into either equation 1 or 2 to solve for o. Let's use equation 1:

26o - 44(1.22) = 95
26o - 53.68 = 95
26o = 148.68

Now, we can solve for o:

o = 148.68 / 26
o = 5.72

Therefore, the values of o and f that satisfy the system of equations are o = 5.72 and f = 1.22.

            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 72B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method.

First, we can multiply the second equation by 89 to make the coefficients of f in both equations equal:

89 * (3 * f + 10 * s) = 89 * 93
267 * f + 890 * s = 8277

Now, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate f:

(267 * f + 890 * s) - (71 * s - 89 * f) = 8277 - 5
267 * f + 890 * s - 71 * s + 89 * f = 8272
356 * f + 819 * s = 8272

Next, we can multiply the first equation by 3 to make the coefficients of s in both equations equal:

3 * (71 * s - 89 * f) = 3 * 5
213 * s - 267 * f = 15

Now, we can add this new equation to the previous equation to eliminate s:

(356 * f + 819 * s) + (213 * s - 267 * f) = 8272 + 15
356 * f + 819 * s + 213 * s - 267 * f = 8287
80 * f + 1032 * s = 8287

Finally, we can solve for f and s using the resulting equation:

80 * f = 8287 - 1032 * s
f = (8287 - 1032 * s) / 80

Substituting this expression for f into the first equation, we get:

71 * s - 89 * ((8287 - 1032 * s) / 80) = 5
71 * s - (89 * 8287 - 89 * 1032 * s) / 80 = 5
71 * s - (737543 - 92088 * s) / 80 = 5
71 * s - 9219.2875 + 1151.1 * s = 5
1822.1 * s = 9224.2875
s = 9224.2875 / 1822.1
s = 5.06

Substituting this value of s back into the expression for f, we get:

f = (8287 - 1032 * 5.06) / 80
f = (8287 - 5203.52) / 80
f = 3083.48 / 80
f = 38.54

Therefore, the values of s and f are s = 5.06 and f = 38.54.
