Total volume of snow = 3442.04 cubic inches
Number of snowballs = 64.7
Volume of each snowball = Total volume of snow / Number of snowballs
Volume of each snowball = 3442.04 / 64.7 = &lt;&lt;3442.04/64.7=53.15&gt;&gt;53.15 cubic inches

The total weight of the hoard after adding the silver is 93.9-6.74 = &lt;&lt;93.9-6.74=87.16&gt;&gt;87.16 kilograms.

            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 72B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: To find out how many kilograms of leaves each giraffe eats daily, we need to divide the total amount of leaves consumed by the herd by the number of giraffes in the herd.
Total leaves consumed by the herd = 2571.29 kilograms
Number of giraffes in the herd = 38.9
Leaves consumed by each giraffe = Total leaves consumed by the herd / Number of giraffes in the herd
Leaves consumed by each giraffe = 2571.29 / 38.9
Leaves consumed by each giraffe = &lt;&lt;2571.29/38.9=66.09&gt;&gt;66.09 kilograms
