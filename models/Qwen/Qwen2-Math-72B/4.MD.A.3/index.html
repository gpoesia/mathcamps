        A rectangle has a length of 21m and a width of 37m. What is the perimeter of the rectangle?

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together the lengths of all four sides. Since a rectangle has two equal lengths and two equal widths, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:
Perimeter = 2 x (length + width) = 2 x (21m + 37m) = 2 x 58m = &lt;&lt;2*58=116&gt;&gt;116m

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together the lengths of all four sides. Since a rectangle has two equal lengths and two equal widths, the perimeter can be calculated as follows:
Perimeter = 2 x (length + width) = 2 x (4m + 37m) = 2 x 41m = &lt;&lt;2*41=82&gt;&gt;82m

        A rectangular garden has a length of 50 feet and a width of 20 feet. What is the perimeter of the garden?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides. Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula for the perimeter is P = 2L + 2W, where L is the length and W is the width.
In this case, the length is 50 feet and the width is 20 feet. So, the perimeter is P = 2(50) + 2(20) = 100 + 40 = &lt;&lt;100+40=140&gt;&gt;140 feet.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The new length of the garden is 15 feet, and the width remains 20 feet. Using the same formula for the perimeter, P = 2L + 2W, we can calculate the new perimeter as P = 2(15) + 2(20) = 30 + 40 = &lt;&lt;30+40=70&gt;&gt;70 feet.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together the lengths of all four sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, the formula for the perimeter is P = 2*(length + width).
In this case, the length of the garden is 26m and the width is 7m. So, the perimeter of the garden is P = 2*(26m + 7m) = 2*33m = 66m.

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width) = 2 * (30m + 27m) = 2 * 57m = &lt;&lt;2*57=114&gt;&gt;114m.

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together the lengths of all four sides. Since a rectangle has two equal lengths and two equal widths, the perimeter can be calculated as follows: Perimeter = 2 x (length + width) = 2 x (11 + 7) = 2 x 18 = 36 meters.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together the lengths of all four sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, the formula for the perimeter is P = 2*(length + width).

    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding together the lengths of all four sides. Since a rectangle has two equal lengths and two equal widths, the perimeter can be calculated as follows: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (15m + 19m) = 2 * 34m = 68m
