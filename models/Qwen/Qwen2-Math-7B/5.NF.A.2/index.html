            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total burn time for the logs is 4 * 1/16 = &lt;&lt;4*1/16=1/4&gt;&gt;1/4 of an hour.
The total burn time for the twigs is 15 * 1/12 = &lt;&lt;15*1/12=5/4&gt;&gt;5/4 of an hour.
The total burn time for the logs and twigs is 1/4 + 5/4 = &lt;&lt;1/4+5/4=3/2&gt;&gt;3/2 of an hour.

            In a park, 10 ducks are equally distributed among 5 ponds, implying each pond has 10 / 5 ducks. In the same park, 8 fish are distributed among 10 small pools, with each pool having 8 / 10 fish. How many animals are there in each pond and pool combined?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Each pond has 10 / 5 = &lt;&lt;10/5=2&gt;&gt;2 ducks, and each pool has 8 / 10 = &lt;&lt;8/10=0.8&gt;&gt;0.8 fish. Since we can't have a fraction of an animal, we'll consider the fish in each pool as 1 fish for simplicity. Therefore, each pond and pool combined has 2 + 1 = &lt;&lt;2+1=3&gt;&gt;3 animals.

To find the total amount of the table painted, we add the fractions: 16/20 + 5/20 = &lt;&lt;16/20+5/20=21/20&gt;&gt;21/20.
Since 21/20 is greater than 1, it means that more than the whole table has been painted. However, since we are looking for the total amount painted, we can simplify 21/20 to 1 and 1/20.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Anne and Bob painted 1 and 1/20 of the table, and Carl painted 11/5 of the table.
To find the total amount of the table painted, we add the fractions: 1 and 1/20 + 11/5 = &lt;&lt;1+1/20+11/5=11/5+1/20&gt;&gt;11/5+1/20.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 20 is 20. So, we convert 11/5 to 44/20.
Now, we can add the fractions: 44/20 + 1/20 = &lt;&lt;44/20+1/20=45/20&gt;&gt;45/20.
Simplifying 45/20, we get 2 and 5/20, which can be further simplified to 2 and 1/4.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The star Alpha shines 17/3 times brighter than an average star, and the star Bravo shines 20/16 times as bright.
To find the total brightness of both stars compared to an average star, we add the relative brightness of the two stars: 17/3 + 20/16 = &lt;&lt;17/3+20/16=101/12&gt;&gt;101/12.
Therefore, both stars are &lt;&lt;101/12=8.416666666666667&gt;&gt;8.416666666666667 times brighter than an average star.
