        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(L + W), where L is the length and W is the width.
We can rearrange this formula to solve for W: W = (P/2) - L.
Substituting the given values, we get W = (324/2) - 83 = &lt;&lt;(324/2)-83=88&gt;&gt;88 meters.

We know that two sides add up to 54m and the other two sides add up to 22m and 37m respectively. Therefore, the length of the remaining side can be found by subtracting the sum of the known sides from the total perimeter.
Remaining side = Perimeter - (Sum of known sides)
Remaining side = 205m - (54m + 22m + 37m)

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. We know the lengths of three sides and the total perimeter, so we can find the length of the fourth side by subtracting the sum of the lengths of the three known sides from the total perimeter.
The sum of the lengths of the three known sides is 79+97+51 = &lt;&lt;79+97+51=227&gt;&gt;227m.
The length of the fourth side is 235-227 = &lt;&lt;235-227=8&gt;&gt;8m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. Let's denote the length of the fourth side as x.
We have the equation: 35 + 76 + 5 + x = 191
Solving for x, we get: x = 191 - (35 + 76 + 5) = &lt;&lt;191-(35+76+5)=75&gt;&gt;75
Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 75 units.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. Since the shorter sides are 51 meters long, we can substitute w = 51 into the formula. The total perimeter is 158 meters, so we have 158 = 2l + 2(51). Simplifying, we get 158 = 2l + 102. Subtracting 102 from both sides, we get 56 = 2l. Dividing both sides by 2, we get l = 28. Therefore, the length of each of the longer sides is 28 meters.

            A rectangular playground is bordered by a fence. Two opposite sides of the fence are 19m each. If the total length of the fence is 166m, what is the length of each of the other two sides?

            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total length of the fence is 166m, and two opposite sides are 19m each, so the total length of the other two sides is 166 - 2*19 = &lt;&lt;166-2*19=128&gt;&gt;128m.
Since the other two sides are equal in length, each side is 128/2 = &lt;&lt;128/2=64&gt;&gt;64m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. We know the lengths of three sides, so we can find the length of the fourth side by subtracting the sum of the lengths of the three known sides from the perimeter.
The sum of the lengths of the three known sides is 40m + 32m + 95m = &lt;&lt;40+32+95=167&gt;&gt;167m.
The length of the fourth side is 246m - 167m = &lt;&lt;246-167=79&gt;&gt;79m.

We can set up the equation: 29 + 16 + 41 + x = 160. Solving for x, we get x = 160 - (29 + 16 + 41) = &lt;&lt;160-(29+16+41)=74&gt;&gt;74m.

Given that the perimeter is 98m and one side (let's assume it's the width) is 5m, we can set up the equation 98 = 2(l + 5). Solving for l, we get l = (98 - 10)/2 = &lt;&lt;(98 - 10)/2=44&gt;&gt;44m.

            <span class="response-field">Qwen2-Math 7B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. Since the rectangle has two sides measuring 45m each, we can assume that these are the lengths. Therefore, the perimeter can be expressed as P = 2(45) + 2w = 210. Solving for w, we get w = (210 - 2(45)) / 2 = &lt;&lt;(210 - 2(45)) / 2=30&gt;&gt;30m.
