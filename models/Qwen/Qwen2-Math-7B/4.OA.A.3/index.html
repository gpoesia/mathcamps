            A songwriter creates a long ballad with many verses. Each verse has 162 words and he divides these into 18 lines per verse. This gives a certain number of words per line. To each line, he adds 34 more words as a refrain. What is the total number of words present in each line now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The songwriter divides 162 words into 18 lines, so each line has 162/18 = &lt;&lt;162/18=9&gt;&gt;9 words.
To each line, he adds 34 more words, so the total number of words per line is 9+34 = &lt;&lt;9+34=43&gt;&gt;43 words.

            A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

The penguin population in the second place is 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes, so the total number of penguins in the second place is 598 / 26 = &lt;&lt;598/26=23&gt;&gt;23.
The penguin population in the first place increased by 33, so the total number of penguins in the first place is 84 + 33 = &lt;&lt;84+33=117&gt;&gt;117.
The penguin population in the first place decreased by 10, so the total number of penguins in the first place is 117 - 10 = &lt;&lt;117-10=107&gt;&gt;107.
The total number of penguins in the first place and the second place is 107 + 23 = &lt;&lt;107+23=130&gt;&gt;130.
The total number of penguins in the first place and the second place increased by 20 adults and 14 chicks, so the final total number of penguins is 130 + 20 + 14 = &lt;&lt;130+20+14=164&gt;&gt;164.

Subtract 22 from the average rainfall of the typical cloud per hour then multiply this by 23. Add this result to a constant cloud factor of 42. Add this new result to the hourly rainfall of the initial cloud and subtract 2 from it. What is the resultant millimeters of rainfall?

Multiply this by 23: 15.645161290322581 * 23 = &lt;&lt;15.645161290322581*23=359.8387096774193&gt;&gt;359.8387096774193

            At the zoo, there were 2 trips being hosted. Each trip was allowed to see 2 animals. However, each animal had 3 baby animals with them, making the number of animals seen per trip multiplied by 3. If each baby animal could be photographed 21 times, how many photos could be taken in total? Also, if 34 photos were spoiled and unusable out of the entire batch, but guests were given the opportunity to take an additional 30 photos later, how many usable photos would there be in total?

            The snowfall in City A, which lasts for 50 days, is currently 36 days in. In City B, there is a unique snow pattern where for every 14 days, it snows 98 inches. The total snowfall in inches in City A is expected to be the product of the remaining snowfall days in City A and the average daily snowfall in inches in City B. However, the snow removal has been keeping up and has managed to remove an amount of snow equal to the average daily snowfall in City B. How much snow in inches is left in City A after the snow removal?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The remaining snowfall days in City A are 36-14 = &lt;&lt;36-14=22&gt;&gt;22 days.
The average daily snowfall in City B is 98/14 = &lt;&lt;98/14=7&gt;&gt;7 inches.
The total snowfall in inches in City A is 22*7 = &lt;&lt;22*7=154&gt;&gt;154 inches.
The snow removal has managed to remove an amount of snow equal to the average daily snowfall in City B, which is 7 inches.
Therefore, the amount of snow left in City A after the snow removal is 154-7 = &lt;&lt;154-7=147&gt;&gt;147 inches.

Since each jewel requires the exact same amount of emeralds and sapphires that you had left, you can create 12 jewels.
After the process of creation, the total number of jewels is multiplied by itself, so you end up with 12*12 = &lt;&lt;12*12=144&gt;&gt;144 powerful jewels.

            In the initial phase of the puzzle game, instead of collecting 150 points in each of the first two rounds, let's say you managed to collect fewer points such that each round you earned only 15 gold coins as the points were divided by 10.

Therefore, after the second round, you had a different amount of gold coins. In the third round, you collected 28 emeralds and 14 sapphires but had to sacrifice the same newly calculated amount of gold coins (as per the points collected in the first two rounds). How many emeralds and sapphires did you have left after adjusting for the gold coin sacrifice in the third round?

            The previous problem had us determine the total number of police officers on duty under certain conditions. Now, let's imagine a slightly different scenario.

Like the previous situation, there were still 32 officers assigned to the north district and 33 sent to the south. The number for the downtown district was also the same, at 29. However, this time around, only 21 officers from the total force were transferred elsewhere instead of the original scenario's subtraction. A week later, an additional 22 officers, fewer than the 39 from the original scenario, were brought in for a different assignment. That same day, another addition of 14 officers was made, just like with the initial series of events. 

New question: How many officers total were on duty by the end of the day in this amended scenario?

            A toothpaste factory produces 26 tubes of toothpaste every hour. On Sundays, they work for 7 hours and produce additional 8 tubes of toothpaste. So, in one Sunday, they produce ((26 * 7) + 8) tubes.

The following Monday, they continue their production by adding another 31 tubes to their Sunday's total.

In parallel, in the packaging department, they have 50 empty boxes. They use 19 of them for another department, leaving them with (50 - 19) boxes.

The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is calculated by adding the packaged boxes number with Monday's production.

On Tuesday, they produced an additional 48 tubes of toothpaste. What is the total number of produced toothpaste tubes until Tuesday, inclusive?

            A gardener planted 13 Sunflowers in his garden. The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed. By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on and the spots needed, then he doubled that total for no particular reason. How many did he end up with?

            Using the initial information from the previous problem where 18 frogs catch 21 flies each in a day (resulting in a total of 'j' flies), imagine the scenario where a particularly voracious toad comes by the next day and catches an additional 39 flies. How many flies have been caught in total over the two days then?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total number of flies caught over the two days is the sum of the flies caught by the frogs and the flies caught by the toad.
The total number of flies caught by the frogs over two days is 2*j = &lt;&lt;2*j=2*378=756&gt;&gt;756.
The toad catches an additional 39 flies.
Therefore, the total number of flies caught over the two days is 756+39 = &lt;&lt;756+39=795&gt;&gt;795.

From the trees near the school, they picked 16 more baskets and from the trees near the mayor's house, they picked 13 more baskets. They realized that their lemons were heavier and they could extract more juice so they decided to get 35 baskets to make lemonade. If each basket of lemons could produce 14 bottles of lemonade, how many bottles of lemonade would they get from the remaining baskets?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The total number of baskets picked is 38+24+16+13 = &lt;&lt;38+24+16+13=81&gt;&gt;81 baskets.
After giving away 35 baskets for lemonade, they have 81-35 = &lt;&lt;81-35=46&gt;&gt;46 baskets left.
From these remaining baskets, they can get 46*14 = &lt;&lt;46*14=644&gt;&gt;644 bottles of lemonade.

            In the initial story, Amy found 21 seashells in the sandbox and gave 15 of them away. She then found another 13 seashells, more than what she had kept for herself from the prior day. Additionally, she found 49 more seashells. However, let's reconsider the story and change the part where Amy gave away 23 seashells to her brother. Instead, imagine that she gave away 32 seashells to her brother. If she still gave 27 seashells to her cousin after this, how many seashells does Amy have left now?

After that, he finds a shortcut which saves him an additional 4 days, and a friendly traveller advised him of another path that will save him 40 days. If he also saves 21 days due to good weather, how many days in total did he save on his journey?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The hiker initially planned to travel for 36 days. After increasing his daily average to 16 miles, he reduced his remaining journey by 36 - 16 = &lt;&lt;36-16=20&gt;&gt;20 days. With the additional 4-day shortcut, he saved 20 + 4 = &lt;&lt;20+4=24&gt;&gt;24 days. The friendly traveller's advice saved him 4 more days, and good weather saved him 21 days. Therefore, the hiker saved a total of 24 + 4 + 40 + 21 = &lt;&lt;24+4+40+21=89&gt;&gt;89 days on his journey.

Re-calculate the rate of ticks per minute for this clock and add 34 to it. As before, calculate the tick rate for the first clock, then multiply it by 35 and subtract 41. Finally, subtract this modified rate of the second clock from the manipulated rate of the first clock. What is the new result?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The first clock still ticks 12 times per minute. After multiplying by 35 and subtracting 41, we get 12*35-41 = &lt;&lt;12*35-41=379&gt;&gt;379.
The second clock now ticks 279/2 = &lt;&lt;279/2=139.5&gt;&gt;139.5 times per minute. After adding 34, we get 139.5+34 = &lt;&lt;139.5+34=173.5&gt;&gt;173.5.
Subtracting the second clock's rate from the first clock's manipulated rate gives us 379-173.5 = &lt;&lt;379-173.5=205.5&gt;&gt;205.5.

            The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Your friend needs 37 - 32 = &lt;&lt;37-32=5&gt;&gt;5 squares for the hours.
They then added 42 to the result, which is 5 + 42 = &lt;&lt;5+42=47&gt;&gt;47 squares.
Subtracting 37 from that total, they got 47 - 37 = &lt;&lt;47-37=10&gt;&gt;10 squares.
Adding 25 more squares for the minutes, they had 10 + 25 = &lt;&lt;10+25=35&gt;&gt;35 squares.
Adding another 28 squares for the seconds, they had 35 + 28 = &lt;&lt;35+28=63&gt;&gt;63 squares.
Adding 41 to 25, they got 41 + 25 = &lt;&lt;41+25=66&gt;&gt;66 squares.
Adding another 28, they had 66 + 28 = &lt;&lt;66+28=94&gt;&gt;94 squares.
Adding 17 to the result, they got 94 + 17 = &lt;&lt;94+17=111&gt;&gt;111 squares.
Finally, reducing the total number of squares by 23, they had 111 - 23 = &lt;&lt;111-23=88&gt;&gt;88 squares.
Adding the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number, they had 88 + 5 = &lt;&lt;88+5=93&gt;&gt;93 squares.

            Let's reconsider the original scenario where the reserve started with ginger giraffes. But this time assume that the reserve initially had 42 ginger giraffes instead of 16. They again brought in the same number of golden giraffes as the ginger ones. Later, they decided to add another group of 46 greyish giraffes. What would be the total number of giraffes in the reserve now under this new scenario?

            A turtle decides to swim. One day, it travels as many leagues as 11 plus 10, then multiplies that by 16 to get the total distance it swam that week. Later, it realized it had over calculated the distance by 41 leagues. What is the real distance it swam that week?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The turtle swam 11+10 = &lt;&lt;11+10=21&gt;&gt;21 leagues.
The turtle swam 21*16 = &lt;&lt;21*16=336&gt;&gt;336 leagues that week.
The turtle over calculated the distance by 41 leagues, so the real distance it swam that week is 336-41 = &lt;&lt;336-41=295&gt;&gt;295 leagues.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Continuing from the previous scenario, consider that the turtle realizes that it originally miscalculated the daily travel distance. Instead of swimming 11 leagues plus 10 a day, it actually swam 11 leagues plus 17 leagues a day. After multiplying that daily total by 16 for the week, and subtracting the over-calculated 41 leagues, how much did the turtle actually swim in the originally estimated week?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The turtle swam 11+17 = &lt;&lt;11+17=28&gt;&gt;28 leagues a day.
The turtle swam 28*16 = &lt;&lt;28*16=448&gt;&gt;448 leagues that week.
The turtle over calculated the distance by 41 leagues, so the actual distance it swam that week is 448-41 = &lt;&lt;448-41=407&gt;&gt;407 leagues.
