Since we can't have a fraction of a pizza box, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 4.
4 * 196 = &lt;&lt;4*196=784&gt;&gt;784
975 - 784 = &lt;&lt;975-784=191&gt;&gt;191
There will be 191 left over slices.

            A hat shop makes 830 hats every week. In order to make special edition boxes, the shop plans to put 421 hats in each box. If all the hats are evenly distributed among the boxes, how many hats will be left over?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The number of hats left over is the remainder when 830 is divided by 421.
830 Ã· 421 = &lt;&lt;830%421=109&gt;&gt;109 remainder 109.
Therefore, there will be 109 hats left over.

Since we can't have a fraction of a cluster, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1.

Since each barn can store up to 259 bales, the first barn will store 259 bales.
The second barn will store 330-259 = &lt;&lt;330-259=71&gt;&gt;71 bales.

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 day.

Since we can't have a fraction of a snowman, we can only build 4 snowmen.

Since we can't have a fraction of a territory, we round down to 4 territories.
4 territories * 95 animals/territory = &lt;&lt;4*95=380&gt;&gt;380 animals.

Since we can't have a fraction of a territory, we round down to 5 territories.
5 territories * 95 animals/territory = &lt;&lt;5*95=475&gt;&gt;475 animals.

            On a pirate ship, there are 995 gold coins that need to be evenly divided among the 267 pirates. If they split the gold up as evenly as possible, how many gold coins will be left over?
        </p>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 995/267 = &lt;&lt;995/267=3.72&gt;&gt;3.72
Since the number of gold coins must be a whole number, we can't have a fraction of a coin. Therefore, we need to find the remainder when 995 is divided by 267.
995 mod 267 = &lt;&lt;995 mod 267=154&gt;&gt;154
So, there will be 154 gold coins left over.

Since they can't make a fraction of a batch, they can make 32 batches.
