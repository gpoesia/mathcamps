            Let's consider a new scenario. Suppose initially, James only had 1 helicopter from his birthday party and was able to buy 1 more from the toy storeâ€” not 2 as in the previous situation. After receiving these new helicopters, Rebecca again gave away the same number of helicopters that James already had. How many helicopters does Rebecca have now?

            There were 2 dragons playing in the field, but then 1 of them decided to leave and go back to its lair. Later, 4 other dragons saw the single dragon playing in the field and wanted to join it, but they realized they needed to leave the dragons in their lair by subtracting the number of dragons already playing in the field. How many dragons had to leave their lair to join the playing dragon?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: Initially, there were 2 dragons playing in the field. One left, so there was 1 dragon left. Then, 4 more dragons joined, making the total number of dragons 1+4 = &lt;&lt;1+4=5&gt;&gt;5.
To find out how many dragons had to leave their lair, we subtract the number of dragons already playing in the field from the total number of dragons that joined: 5-1 = &lt;&lt;5-1=4&gt;&gt;4.
