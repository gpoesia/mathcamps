After the first increase, there were 72+62 = &lt;&lt;72+62=134&gt;&gt;134 people at the party.
At the end, there were 134+52 = &lt;&lt;134+52=186&gt;&gt;186 people at the party.

The pre-party had 66+6 = &lt;&lt;66+6=72&gt;&gt;72 people.

Therefore, the total attendance for both events is 72+186 = &lt;&lt;72+186=258&gt;&gt;258 people.

            Let's change the scenario a bit. Suppose the student does everything as before, rotating an angle to form 92 degrees, and again by an additional of 84 degrees to form shape 't'. Then they modify shape 't' by adding another 90 degrees to form shape 'l'. But this time, instead of rotating an additional 66 degrees for shape 'n', he rotates by 30 degrees. What would be the total degree measure of the rotations made to get to shape 'n' in this case?

            In the previous scenario, John initially bought 59 jackets. However, let's reconsider that scenario with a slight modification. 

This time, after buying the initial 59 jackets, John went to another store and bought 83 more jackets. Then, as he was leaving, he noticed a stand with discount jackets and purchased 58 more of them there. 

How many jackets did John buy in total under these new conditions?
