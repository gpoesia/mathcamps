            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: If a dolphin jumps 5 times in a minute, then in 'p' minutes, it can jump 5p times.
Given that the dolphin jumps 60 times in 'p' minutes, we can set up the equation 5p = 60.
Solving for 'p', we get p = 60/5 = &lt;&lt;60/5=12&gt;&gt;12.
Therefore, the dolphin jumped for 12 minutes.
