        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: John needs to save $40 - $29 = &lt;&lt;40-29=11&gt;&gt;11 more dollars.
Every week, John saves 20/48 of the remaining amount, which is 20/48 * $11 = &lt;&lt;20/48*11=2.7083333333333335&gt;&gt;$2.71 (rounded to the nearest cent).
After a year, the investment will grow by 41/11 times the amount invested, so John will have $2.71 * 41/11 = &lt;&lt;2.71*41/11=10.036363636363637&gt;&gt;$10.04 (rounded to the nearest cent) in his investment account.
