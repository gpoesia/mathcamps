The total length of the field is 55 meters. The usable length of the field is 27 meters. The length of the field that cannot be used is the total length minus the usable length.

55 - 27 = &lt;&lt;55-27=28&gt;&gt;28 meters.

Therefore, 28 meters of the field cannot be used.

Total length = 9 inches + 10 inches * number of bricks + 10 inches
Total length = 10 inches * number of bricks + 19 inches
Therefore, the total length of the bricks will be 10 inches * (number of bricks + 1) + 19 inches.

Reasoning: The train travels 82 kilometers before the stop and 14 kilometers after the stop.
The total distance the train travels is 82 + 14 = &lt;&lt;82+14=96&gt;&gt;96 kilometers.
