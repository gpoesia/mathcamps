            There are 73841 cubic centimeters of air needed to inflate a large beach ball. If we fill the ball up at a rate of 41 cubic centimeters per second, how many seconds will it take to fully inflate the beach ball?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total volume of the ball is 73841 cubic centimeters. The rate at which the ball is being inflated is 41 cubic centimeters per second. To find out how many seconds it will take to inflate the ball, we divide the total volume by the rate of inflation.

73841 / 41 = &lt;&lt;73841/41=1795&gt;&gt;1795 seconds.

Therefore, it will take 1795 seconds to fully inflate the beach ball.

Reasoning: The total snowfall is divided evenly over 225 days, so we can find the amount of snowfall each day by dividing the total snowfall by the number of days.

The total snowfall is 31950 inches.
The number of days is 225.

Therefore, the amount of snowfall each day is 31950 / 225 = &lt;&lt;31950/225=140.6&gt;&gt;140.6 inches.

Reasoning: The total amount of gold the goldsmith has is 60544 milligrams. Each ring requires 5504 milligrams of gold. To find out how many full rings the goldsmith can make, we divide the total amount of gold by the amount of gold required for one ring.

            Across the span of 82 days in winter, a town recorded a total snowfall of 36900 inches. If the snow fell at a constant rate every day, how many inches of snow did the town receive each day?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total snowfall is 36900 inches. The number of days is 82. To find out how many inches of snow fell each day, we divide the total snowfall by the number of days.

36900 ï¿½ 82 = &lt;&lt;36900/82=450.56&gt;&gt;450.56 inches of snow fell each day.

Since the snowfall is a continuous process, it is not possible to have a fraction of an inch of snow. Therefore, the town received 450 inches of snow each day.

Reasoning: The total amount of apples produced is 36,784. If the amount of harvested apples is the same each week, then the total amount of apples produced divided by the number of weeks is the amount of apples produced each week.

36,784 apples / 19 weeks = &lt;&lt;36784/19=1955.05&gt;&gt;1955.05 apples per week.

However, the number of apples per week should be a whole number, so we round down to the nearest whole number.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total amount of flour used was 62118 grams. This amount was used over 2142 days. To find out how much flour was used each day, we divide the total amount of flour by the number of days.

62118 grams / 2142 days = &lt;&lt;62118/2142&gt;&gt;29 grams per day.

So, the baker used 29 grams of flour each day.

Reasoning: The total number of messages sent by the alien civilization is 43134. If they send exactly the same number of messages each day, then the total number of days they sent messages is 3318. Therefore, the number of messages sent per day is 43134 / 3318 = &lt;&lt;43134/3318=13.0&gt;&gt;13.0.

However, since the number of messages per day must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 13.

Reasoning: The total miles driven by all the buses in a week is 85300 miles. There are 3412 buses in the fleet. So, the total miles driven by one bus in a week is 85300 miles divided by 3412 buses.

Let's calculate it.

85300 miles / 3412 buses = &lt;&lt;85300/3412=25.25&gt;&gt;25.25 miles per bus per week.

Reasoning: The number of eggs laid by the butterfly is 5385. The number of flowers is 359. To find out how many eggs were laid on each flower, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of flowers.

So, 5385 / 359 = &lt;&lt;5385/359=14.87&gt;&gt;14.87 eggs were laid on each flower.

However, since it's not possible to have a fraction of an egg, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, the butterfly laid 14 eggs on each flower.

Reasoning: The total square inches of glass required for all windows is the total glass required for one window multiplied by the number of windows.
So, the total square inches of glass required is 6354 * 2118 = &lt;&lt;6354*2118=13360012&gt;&gt;13360012 square inches.

Reasoning: The total distance the frog jumps is the distance per jump times the number of jumps. So, the distance per jump is the total distance divided by the number of jumps.

The frog jumps 12288 cm in 512 jumps. So, the distance per jump is 12288 cm / 512 jumps = &lt;&lt;12288/512=24&gt;&gt;24 cm.

            A toy company has made 1865 stuffed animals spread over 373 different designs. If each design has the same number of stuffed animals, how many stuffed animals are there for each design?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of stuffed animals is 1865. Since there are 373 different designs, each design has 1865/373 = &lt;&lt;1865/373=4.99&gt;&gt;4.99 stuffed animals.
However, the number of stuffed animals for each design should be an integer, so we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5.
### Answer: 5

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of pen units produced is 9636. The number of retailers is 44. Therefore, each retailer receives 9636/44 = &lt;&lt;9636/44=218.22&gt;&gt;218.22 pen units.
