Reasoning: William's robot initially scored 13 points. After fixing the issue, it scored 13 - 8 = &lt;&lt;13-8=5&gt;&gt;5 points less. After accruing an additional 5 points, it scored 5 + 5 = &lt;&lt;5+5=10&gt;&gt;10 points more. Therefore, William's robot's total score is 13 - 8 + 5 = &lt;&lt;13-8+5=10&gt;&gt;10 points.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of rainbows seen in the day is the sum of the rainbows seen at the beginning of the day and the rainbows seen later. One rainbow faded away, so the total number of rainbows visible at the end of the day is the total number of rainbows seen minus the number of rainbows that faded away.

Total rainbows seen = 8 (at the beginning) + 4 (later) = 12

Rainbows visible at the end of the day = 12 (total) - 1 (faded away) = &lt;&lt;12-1=11&gt;&gt;11

            After making that first bracelet, Maya uses all the remaining beads to make a second bracelet. If that second bracelet needs 18 beads in total, how many more beads does Maya need to complete it?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The second bracelet needs 18 beads in total.
The first bracelet used 6 beads, leaving Maya with 20 - 6 = &lt;&lt;20-6=14&gt;&gt;14 beads.
To complete the second bracelet, Maya needs 18 - 14 = &lt;&lt;18-14=4&gt;&gt;4 more beads.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: Alex saw 6 dinosaurs in the morning and 4 more in the afternoon.
So, Alex saw 6 + 4 = &lt;&lt;6+4=10&gt;&gt;10 dinosaurs in total.

            A baby Tyrannosaurus Rex had 3 teeth when it was born. Every week, the baby T-Rex grows 3 more teeth. How many teeth does the T-Rex have after one week?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The baby T-Rex had 3 teeth when it was born. After one week, it grew 3 more teeth. So, the total number of teeth after one week is 3 (initial teeth) + 3 (new teeth) = &lt;&lt;3+3=6&gt;&gt;6 teeth.
