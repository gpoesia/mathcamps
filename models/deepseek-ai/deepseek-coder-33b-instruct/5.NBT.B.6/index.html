Reasoning: The total distance the bus drives is 2496 miles. There are 52 weeks. To find the average distance per week, we divide the total distance by the number of weeks.

Average distance per week = 2496 miles / 52 weeks = &lt;&lt;2496/52=48.13&gt;&gt;48.13 miles.

            An astronaut has a 90-day mission in space during which he consumes a total of 3870 liters of oxygen. If his oxygen consumption is the same every day, how much oxygen does he use daily?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total amount of oxygen consumed by the astronaut is 3870 liters. This is divided by the number of days, 90, to find the daily consumption.

Daily consumption = 3870 liters / 90 days = &lt;&lt;3870/90=42.94&gt;&gt;42.94 liters per day.

However, the answer should be a whole number, so we round up to the nearest whole number.

Daily consumption = &lt;&lt;round(42.94)=43&gt;&gt;43 liters per day.

Reasoning: The total number of bracelets is 2520. The number of display cases is 56. To find out how many bracelets are in each display case, we divide the total number of bracelets by the number of display cases.

Reasoning: The total distance the tiger traveled is 4104 miles. If the tiger traveled an equal number of miles each day, then the total distance divided by the number of days gives the distance traveled each day.

So, 4104 miles / 54 days = &lt;&lt;4104/54=78.57&gt;&gt;78.57 miles per day.

Reasoning: The total number of stones used to create the bracelet is 87. Since each part of the bracelet is identical, the number of stones in each part is the total number of stones divided by the number of parts.

So, the number of stones in each part of the bracelet is 87/29 = &lt;&lt;87/29=3.03&gt;&gt;3.03 stones.

However, the number of stones cannot be a fraction, so the jewelry maker must have used a whole number of stones in each part of the bracelet. Therefore, the number of stones in each part of the bracelet is 3 stones.

Reasoning: The total number of pages in the novel is 4606. If you want to read it over 47 days, you need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days.

So, 4606 / 47 = &lt;&lt;4606/47=100.16&gt;&gt;100.16 pages per day.

Since you can't read a fraction of a page, you need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Reasoning: The total number of skirts that can be made is the total amount of fabric divided by the amount of fabric used to make each skirt.
Total number of skirts = Total fabric / Fabric per skirt
Total number of skirts = 3234 / 33
Total number of skirts = 3234 / 33 = &lt;&lt;3234/33=97&gt;&gt;97 skirts.

Reasoning: The total number of marshmallows Sam has is 3025. He wants to package them into bags of 55. So, he will need to divide the total number of marshmallows by the number of marshmallows in each bag.

3025 / 55 = &lt;&lt;3025/55=56.27&gt;&gt;56.27 bags.

Since Sam can't have a fraction of a bag, he will need to buy 57 bags.

Reasoning: The total amount of snowfall is 1740 inches. There were 87 days. To find the average amount of snowfall per day, we divide the total snowfall by the number of days.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total distance traveled by the scooter is 1600 feet. The total time it took to travel this distance is 64 seconds. To find out how many feet the scooter travels in each second, we divide the total distance by the total time.

1600 feet / 64 seconds = &lt;&lt;1600/64=24.5&gt;&gt;24.5 feet per second.

However, the distance traveled per second cannot be a fraction of a foot. Therefore, the scooter travels approximately 24 feet per second.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The shop makes bracelets using 69 small pearls. To find out how many full bracelets can be made from 3657 pearls, we divide the total number of pearls by the number of pearls used in each bracelet.

3657 pearls / 69 pearls per bracelet = &lt;&lt;3657/69&gt;&gt;53.17 bracelets.

However, a bracelet cannot be made with a fraction of a pearl, so the shop can only make 53 full bracelets.

            A forest contains 2508 trees evenly distributed over 38 hectares of land. How many trees are there per hectare?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The number of trees per hectare is the total number of trees divided by the total area.

So, 2508 / 38 = &lt;&lt;2508/38=65.71&gt;&gt;65.71 trees per hectare.

However, since the number of trees is a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 66 trees per hectare.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of jewels divided by the number of years gives the number of jewels collected each year.
3010 / 43 = &lt;&lt;3010/43=71.02&gt;&gt;71.02 jewels each year.
However, the number of jewels cannot be a fraction, so we round it to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, Natalia collected 71 jewels each year.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of signals sent by the spaceship is 6699. If the spaceship sends the same number of signals each day, then the number of signals sent daily is the total number of signals divided by the number of days.

6699 signals / 87 days = &lt;&lt;6699/87=76.75757575757575&gt;&gt;76.75757575757575 signals daily.

However, the number of signals sent daily must be a whole number, so the alien spaceship sends 76 signals daily.
