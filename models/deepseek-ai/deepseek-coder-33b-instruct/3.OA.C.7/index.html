            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: Jetstream's strength is 5 times that of Green Gauntlet.
So, Jetstream's strength is 5 * Green Gauntlet's strength.
Green Gauntlet's strength is 3 times its original strength.
So, Green Gauntlet's strength is 3 * Jetstream's strength / 5.
Substituting Green Gauntlet's strength from the second equation into the first equation, we get:
Jetstream's strength is 5 * (3 * Jetstream's strength / 5) = &lt;&lt;5*3*Jetstream's strength/5=3*Jetstream's strength&gt;&gt;3 * Jetstream's strength.
Solving for Jetstream's strength, we get:
Jetstream's strength = &lt;&lt;3*Jetstream's strength/3=Jetstream's strength&gt;&gt;Jetstream's strength / 3.
Solving for Jetstream's strength, we get:
Jetstream's strength = 5 * Green Gauntlet's strength / 3.
So, the strength of Jetstream is 5 * 3 = &lt;&lt;5*3=15&gt;&gt;15 times the strength of Green Gauntlet.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: Let's denote the height of the penguin as h. The penguin took 28 seconds to reach a depth that is 4 times its own height. This means that the depth of the penguin is 4h. The time it takes for the penguin to reach this depth is 28 seconds. Therefore, the speed of the penguin is h/28.

The depth of the penguin in seconds is the depth divided by the speed. This gives us (4h)/(h/28) = &lt;&lt;4*28=112&gt;&gt;112 seconds.

The square of the depth the penguin reaches in seconds is (112)^2 = &lt;&lt;112*112=12544&gt;&gt;12544.

Reasoning: Charlie multiplies the amount of chocolates he has by 9, so he has 4*9 = &lt;&lt;4*9=36&gt;&gt;36 chocolates.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Following from the previous problems, let's consider a new scenario. This time, suppose Charlie only had 2 chocolates and again decided to share half of them with his sister. Then, he counts his remaining chocolates and decides to double the amount. How many chocolates does Charlie have now in this scenario?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">

Reasoning: Charlie shares half of his chocolates with his sister, so he has 2/2 = &lt;&lt;2/2=1&gt;&gt;1 chocolate left.
Then he doubles the amount of chocolates he has, so he has 1*2 = &lt;&lt;1*2=2&gt;&gt;2 chocolates.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            A castle has 36 towers and there are an equal number of towers on each of its 6 walls. How many towers are there on each wall?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of towers in the castle is 36. Since there are 6 walls, each wall has 36/6 = &lt;&lt;36/6=6&gt;&gt;6 towers.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Suppose the number of walls in the castle was incorrectly counted before, and there are actually 10 walls instead of 6. If the castle still has a total of 36 towers, how many towers would be on each wall in that case?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of towers in the castle is still 36. Since there are 10 walls, each wall would have 36/10 = &lt;&lt;36/10=3.6&gt;&gt;3.6 towers.
However, the number of towers on each wall should be a whole number, so we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4.
