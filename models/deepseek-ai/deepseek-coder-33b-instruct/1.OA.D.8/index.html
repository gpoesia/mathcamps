            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The butterfly collector started with 6 butterflies. He caught 13 more butterflies. So, the total number of butterflies at the end of the day is 6 + 13 = &lt;&lt;6+13=19&gt;&gt;19.
The number of butterflies that flew away during the day is the total number of butterflies at the end of the day minus the initial number of butterflies.
19 - 6 = &lt;&lt;19-6=13&gt;&gt;13 butterflies flew away during the day.

            After a birthday party, you see one piece of cake left. If you originally had a whole cake that was cut into h slices, and each slice was equal in size, then how many slices were there in the whole cake, given that 12 pieces have been eaten during the party?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 

Let's denote the number of slices in the whole cake as h. 

The number of slices eaten during the party is 12. 

The number of slices left after the party is 1. 

So, we have the equation: h - 12 = 1. 

Solving this equation for h gives us h = 12 + 1 = 13. 

So, the original cake was cut into 13 slices.

Reasoning: Oliver originally had 'o' bones in his backyard. After giving 19 of these bones to his friend, he was left with only 1 bone.
So, 'o' - 19 = 1.
Let's solve this equation for 'o'.
'o' - 19 = 1
'o' = 19 + 1
'o' = &lt;&lt;19+1=20&gt;&gt;20.

Reasoning: The number of trains that have already departed during the day is the total number of trains scheduled for departure minus the number of trains left to depart by late evening.

Reasoning: Let's denote the original number of towels as x. After handing out some, he had 10 remaining. This means x - 10 = 10.

Reasoning: The climber started at a point that is m feet high. They climbed downwards for a while, reaching a point that's 10 feet high. If they had climbed down 4 feet to reach this point, then the point where they started is m + 4 feet high.

Let's denote the height of the point where they started as m.

The height of the point where they started is m + 4 feet high.

The height of the point where they started is 10 feet high.

Therefore, m = 10 - 4 = &lt;&lt;10-4=6&gt;&gt;6 feet.

So, the point where they started was 6 feet high.

2 (starting pencils) - 3 (final pencils) = -1 (classmate's pencils)

Change received = 12 - 16 = &lt;&lt;12-16=-4&gt;&gt;-4 dollars.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: If 7 snowballs were removed, then the original number of snowballs is 11 + 7 = 18.
### Answer: 18

            In underwater kingdom, there were 10 mermaids at the beginning. After a while, there were 20 mermaids. How many new mermaids joined the kingdom?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The number of new mermaids that joined the kingdom is the difference between the final number of mermaids and the initial number of mermaids.

The difference between 20 and 10 is 20-10 = &lt;&lt;20-10=10&gt;&gt;10.

Therefore, 10 new mermaids joined the kingdom.
