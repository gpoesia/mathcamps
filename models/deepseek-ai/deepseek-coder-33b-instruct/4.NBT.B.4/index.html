Reasoning: The second factory made 4404 more doors than the first factory. So, the first factory made 3706 - 4404 = &lt;&lt;3706-4404=-798&gt;&gt;-798 doors.
The total number of doors made by the company is the sum of the doors made in the first and second factories. So, the total number of doors made is 3706 - 798 + 4404 = &lt;&lt;3706-798+4404=6806&gt;&gt;6806.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The wind gust was reduced by 1152 km/h.
4245 - 1152 = &lt;&lt;4245-1152=3093&gt;&gt;3093 km/h.
### Answer: 3093
