Reasoning: The total amount James gave the clerk is 30Â¢. The cost of the candy bar is 22Â¢. The change James should receive is the total amount given minus the cost of the candy bar.

Reasoning: First, Ryan gives all his saved money to his mom, so he has $0 left. Then, his mom gives him back the remaining amount after each purchase. So, he gives $93 to his mom, and she gives him back $93. Then, he spends $11 on a comic book, and his mom gives him back $93-11 = &lt;&lt;93-11=82&gt;&gt;82. Then, he spends $64 on a new video game, and his mom gives him back $82-64 = &lt;&lt;82-64=18&gt;&gt;18. So, Ryan has $18 left after buying the video game.

Reasoning: Lisa has 43 $1 bills. She earns another 27 $1 bills from her part-time job. So, she has 43+27 = &lt;&lt;43+27=70&gt;&gt;70 $1 bills.
She buys a dress for $50. So, she has 70-50 = &lt;&lt;70-50=20&gt;&gt;20 $1 bills left.
