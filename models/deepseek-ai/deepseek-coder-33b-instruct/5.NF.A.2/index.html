            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of bananas given to Johnnie the monkey is the sum of the bananas given in the morning and the bananas given in the afternoon.

In the morning, Johnnie the monkey was given 18/7 = &lt;&lt;18/7=2.5714285714285716&gt;&gt;2.5714285714285716 bananas.
In the afternoon, Johnnie the monkey was given 12/14 = &lt;&lt;12/14=0.8571428571428571&gt;&gt;0.8571428571428571 bananas.

So, in total, Johnnie the monkey was given 2.5714285714285716 + 0.8571428571428571 = &lt;&lt;2.5714285714285716+0.8571428571428571=3.4285714285714284&gt;&gt;3.4285714285714284 bananas.

The amount left unused is 5.666666666666667 - 1.3636363636363635 = &lt;&lt;5.666666666666667-1.3636363636363635=4.303030303030303&gt;&gt;4.303030303030303 liters.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: Billy initially traveled 4 miles. He rolled back for 17/20 of a mile, which is 17/20 * 1 = &lt;&lt;17/20*1=0.85&gt;&gt;0.85 miles.
So, he ultimately traveled forward 4 - 0.85 = &lt;&lt;4-0.85=3.15&gt;&gt;3.15 miles.

Reasoning: The total burn time for the logs is 4 logs * 1/16 hour/log = &lt;&lt;4*1/16=1/4&gt;&gt;1/4 hour.
The total burn time for the twigs is 16 twigs * 1/12 hour/twig = &lt;&lt;16*1/12=1/12*16=1.3333&gt;&gt;1.3333 hour.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 

In the first scenario, each pond has 10 / 5 = &lt;&lt;10/5=2&gt;&gt;2 ducks.

In the second scenario, each pool has 8 / 10 = &lt;&lt;8/10=0.8&gt;&gt;0.8 fish.

Since we are asked for the total number of animals in each pond and pool combined, we add the number of ducks and fish in each.

For each pond, there are 2 ducks and 0.8 fish, so the total number of animals in each pond is 2 + 0.8 = &lt;&lt;2+0.8=2.8&gt;&gt;2.8.

For each pool, there are 0.8 fish, so the total number of animals in each pool is 0.8.

Therefore, the total number of animals in each pond and pool combined is 2.8 animals in each pond and 0.8 animals in each pool.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The ballerina's routine originally lasted 13/5 = &lt;&lt;13/5=2.6&gt;&gt;2.6 minutes.
After shortening it by 15/16 minutes, the routine lasts 2.6 - 15/16 = &lt;&lt;2.6-15/16=2.6-0.9375=1.6625&gt;&gt;1.6625 minutes.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>

Reasoning: The total change in distance this year is the sum of the yearly increase and the unexpected increase.

The yearly increase is 4/16 meters.
The unexpected increase is 20/6 meters.

So, the total change in distance this year is 4/16 + 20/6 = &lt;&lt;4/16+20/6=10&gt;&gt;10 meters.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: First, we need to find out how many words each person types in a minute.
Jim types 20 words in 16 seconds, so he types 20/16*60 = &lt;&lt;20/16*60=60&gt;&gt;60 words in a minute.
Mary types 9 words in 4 seconds, so she types 9/4*60 = &lt;&lt;9/4*60=225&gt;&gt;225 words in a minute.
So, in total, they type 60+225 = &lt;&lt;60+225=285&gt;&gt;285 words per minute.
To find out how many words they type per second, we divide the total by 60: 285/60 = &lt;&lt;285/60=4.75&gt;&gt;4.75 words per second.

Reasoning: The tree has grown 1/10 of its height this month.
The tree has additionally grown 12/6 = &lt;&lt;12/6=2&gt;&gt;2 feet due to the fertilizer.
The tree has grown 1/10 + 2 = &lt;&lt;1/10+2=2.2&gt;&gt;2.2 feet this month.

            A word game assigns 3/11 of a point for each vowel used and 8/10 of a point for each consonant. If you use 1 vowel and 1 consonant, what will your score be?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
The score for the vowel is 3/11 of a point.
The score for the consonant is 8/10 of a point.
The total score is the sum of the scores for the vowel and the consonant.

Let's calculate it:

The score for the vowel is 3/11 of a point.
The score for the consonant is 8/10 of a point.
The total score is the sum of the scores for the vowel and the consonant.

So, the total score is 3/11 + 8/10 = &lt;&lt;3/11+8/10=0.24+0.8=0.94&gt;&gt;0.94 points.

Therefore, if you use 1 vowel and 1 consonant, your score will be 0.94 points.

Reasoning: The total distance between the three cities is the sum of the distances between the first and second cities and the second and third cities.

The distance between the first and second cities is 13/10 inches.
The distance between the second and third cities is 14/15 inches.

So, the total distance between the three cities is 13/10 + 14/15 = &lt;&lt;13/10+14/15=119/30&gt;&gt;119/30 inches.
