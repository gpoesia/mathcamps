Reasoning: The hat maker uses 70.2 grams of wool to make each hat. If they plan on making 39.2 hats, they will need 70.2 grams of wool for each hat. Therefore, to find the total amount of wool needed, we multiply the amount of wool used per hat by the number of hats.

Reasoning: The total amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the forest can be calculated by multiplying the number of hectares by the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed per hectare.

So, 70.3 hectares * 88.8 tons/hectare = 6307.42 tons.

Therefore, the forest can absorb 6307.42 tons of carbon dioxide in a year.

Reasoning: The total cost to produce the skateboards was $5098.56. The cost to produce each skateboard was $56.4. Therefore, the number of skateboards produced is the total cost divided by the cost per skateboard.

Number of skateboards = Total cost / Cost per skateboard

Number of skateboards = $5098.56 / $56.4

Number of skateboards = $5098.56 / $56.4 = &lt;&lt;5098.56/56.4&gt;&gt;96.0

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total amount of cheese produced is 8578.02 kilograms. The number of supermarkets is 90.2. To find out how many kilograms of cheese each supermarket will receive, we divide the total amount of cheese by the number of supermarkets.

8578.02 kilograms / 90.2 supermarkets = &lt;&lt;8578.02/90.2=94.52&gt;&gt;94.52 kilograms per supermarket.

Therefore, each supermarket will receive 94.52 kilograms of cheese.

Reasoning: There are 47.33 chickens per coop and 73.34 coops. To find the total number of chickens, we multiply the number of chickens per coop by the total number of coops.

Total chickens = 47.33 chickens/coop * 73.34 coops
Total chickens = 47.33 * 73.34
Total chickens = 3493.33 chickens

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Natalia has 3493 chickens.

Reasoning: The total weight of the tents is 1448.37 pounds. There are 69.3 tents in the fleet.
So, the weight of each tent is 1448.37 / 69.3 = &lt;&lt;1448.37/69.3=21.0&gt;&gt;21.0 pounds.

Reasoning: The total volume of the bubbles is the volume of one bubble multiplied by the number of bubbles.
Volume of one bubble = 55.9 cubic centimeters
Number of bubbles = 77.8
Total volume = Volume of one bubble * Number of bubbles

Let's calculate it.
Total volume = 55.9 * 77.8
Total volume = 4338.94

Therefore, the total volume of the bubbles in cubic centimeters is 4338.94.
