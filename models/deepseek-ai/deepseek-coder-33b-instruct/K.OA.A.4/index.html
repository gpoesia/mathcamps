        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of pencils is 10. If 8 of them are mechanical pencils, then the remaining pencils must be regular pencils.
So, the number of regular pencils is 10 - 8 = &lt;&lt;10-8=2&gt;&gt;2.

Reasoning: The total time the kite flew is 10 minutes. The time spent at its highest point is 6 minutes.
The time spent at the ground is the total time minus the time spent at the highest point.
10 - 6 = &lt;&lt;10-6=4&gt;&gt;4 minutes.
Therefore, the kite flew for 4 minutes before it reached its highest point.

Reasoning: The total hours of daylight in a day is 10 hours. If the Sun was up for 8 hours, the remaining hours were hidden behind the clouds.
8 hours of daylight + 2 hours hidden behind the clouds = 10 hours.
Therefore, the sun was hidden behind the clouds for 2 hours.
