The comparison between two fractions is done by cross-multiplication. 

The first fraction is 1/8 and the second fraction is 4/1. 

To cross-multiply, we multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction and the denominator of the first fraction by the numerator of the second fraction. 

So, 1/8 * 4/1 = 4/8 = 1/2. 

Therefore, (1 / 8) _ (4 / 1) = 1/2.

Reasoning: 
First, we simplify the fractions. 

(9 / 3) simplifies to 3.
(7 / 1) simplifies to 7.

Then, we multiply the two simplified fractions together.

3 * 7 = 21.

So, (9 / 3) * (7 / 1) = 21.

Now, we compare this value to the other fraction.

(9 / 3) * (7 / 1) _ (1 / 2) = 21 * (1 / 2) = 10.5.

So, (9 / 3) * (7 / 1) is greater than (9 / 3) * (7 / 1) * (1 / 2).

Therefore, (9 / 3) * (7 / 1) _ (1 / 2) = &lt;&lt; &gt; &gt;&gt;.

The expression (5 / 3) * (10 / 5) simplifies to (5 / 3) * 2.

The expression (5 / 3) * 2 is equivalent to 5 / 3 * 2.

The expression 5 / 3 * 2 simplifies to 5 * 2 / 3.

The expression 5 * 2 / 3 simplifies to 10 / 3.

The expression 10 / 3 is less than 10 / 5.

Therefore, the sign is &lt;.

Reasoning: 

First, we need to simplify the fractions. 

(10 / 9) simplifies to (10 / 9) * (3 / 3) = (10 * 3) / (9 * 3) = &lt;&lt;10*3=30&gt;&gt;30 / &lt;&lt;9*3=27&gt;&gt;27 = &lt;&lt;30/27=1.07&gt;&gt;1.07.

(5 / 6) simplifies to (5 / 6) * (2 / 2) = (5 * 2) / (6 * 2) = &lt;&lt;5*2=10&gt;&gt;10 / &lt;&lt;6*2=12&gt;&gt;12 = &lt;&lt;10/12=0.83&gt;&gt;0.83.

Now, we can compare the two simplified fractions. 

1.07 _ 0.83 = &lt;&lt;1.07*0.83=0.89&gt;&gt;0.89.

Therefore, (10 / 9) _ (5 / 6) = &lt;&lt;1.07*0.83=0.89&gt;&gt;0.89.

So, (10 / 9) _ (5 / 6) = &lt;&lt;1.07*0.83=0.89&gt;&gt;0.89.

So, (10 / 9) _ (5 / 10) is less than 10/6.

Therefore, (10 / 9) _ (5 / 10) _ (10 / 9) _ (5 / 10) is less than 10/6 * 10/6 = &lt;&lt;10/6*10/6&gt;&gt;10/9.

To compare two fractions, we can cross multiply them and then compare the resulting numerators.

Cross multiplying gives us:

2 * 5 _ 1 * 6

This simplifies to:

10 _ 6

2 / 1 = 2
6 / 5 = 1.2

Since 60 is greater than 2, we can conclude that (2 / 1) _ (6 / 5) is greater than (2 / 1). Therefore, the answer is:

To compare the values of two fractions, we can cross multiply them and then compare the resulting numerators.

6/5 * 10/7 = 60/35
10/7 * 6/5 = 60/35

Since 60/35 = 60/35, the fractions are equal.

Therefore, (6 / 5) _ (7 / 10) is equal to (7 / 10) _ (6 / 5).

To compare two fractions, we can cross multiply them to get equivalent fractions.

Cross multiply (2 / 7) and (1 / 6) to get:

2 / 7 * 6 / 6 = 12 / 42

The expression (9 / 9) _ (9 / 10) can be simplified to (1 / 1) _ (9 / 10) which equals 9 / 10.

To compare this fraction with another fraction, we need to insert the appropriate operator. For example, if we want to compare it with 1/2, we would insert the operator &lt; because 9/10 is less than 1/2.

Reasoning:
First, we simplify the fractions. 
(8 / 4) simplifies to 2, and (5 / 2) simplifies to 2.5.
Then, we multiply the two simplified fractions together.

So, the first fraction is equal to the second fraction.

Python code:
```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define the fractions
frac1 = Fraction(8, 4) * Fraction(5, 2)

# Compare the fractions
if frac1 &gt; frac2:

To compare the fractions, we need to cross multiply them. 

Cross multiplying means to multiply each term of the first fraction by each term of the second fraction. 

So, (7 / 6) _ (4 / 5) becomes (7 * 4) / (6 * 5).

Now, we can compare these two fractions.

If (7 * 4) / (6 * 5) is greater than 1, then (7 / 6) is greater than (4 / 5).

If (7 * 4) / (6 * 5) is less than 1, then (7 / 6) is less than (4 / 5).

If (7 * 4) / (6 * 5) is equal to 1, then (7 / 6) is equal to (4 / 5).

Let's calculate it:

(7 * 4) / (6 * 5) = &lt;&lt;(7*4)/(6*5)=4/15&gt;&gt;4/15.

Since 4/15 is less than 1, we can conclude that (7 / 6) is less than (4 / 5).

Reasoning: 
First, we simplify the fractions. 
(6 / 4) simplifies to 1.5 and (2 / 2) simplifies to 1.
Then, we multiply the two simplified fractions together. 
1.5 * 1 equals 1.5.
Therefore, (6 / 4) * (2 / 2) equals 1.5.

To compare this to 1, we can see that 1.5 is greater than 1.

To compare fractions, we need to cross multiply them. Cross multiplying means to multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction, and the denominator of the first fraction by the numerator of the second fraction.

So, (5 / 5) _ (9 / 10) becomes (5 * 10) / (5 * 9).

Now, we can compare these two fractions.

5 * 10 = 50
5 * 9 = 45

So, 50 is greater than 45. Therefore, (5 / 5) _ (9 / 10) is greater than (5 / 5).

So, (5 / 5) _ (9 / 10) _ (5 / 5) is greater than (5 / 5).

Therefore, the answer is:

To compare two fractions, we can cross-multiply them and then compare the resulting numerators.

The first fraction is 6/8 and the second fraction is 2/9.

Cross-multiplying gives us:

6/8 * 9/2 = 45/16

The numerator of the first fraction is 6 and the numerator of the second fraction is 2. Since 6 &gt; 2, the fraction 6/8 is greater than the fraction 2/9.

To compare fractions, we need to cross multiply them.

Cross multiply: (2 / 10) * (2 / 6)

This simplifies to (1 / 15) * (1 / 3)

Reasoning: 

First, we need to simplify the fractions. 

(3 / 2) simplifies to 1.5

(4 / 6) simplifies to 2/3

Then, we multiply the two simplified fractions together. 

1.5 * 2/3 = 3 * 2/3 = 6/3 = 2

So, (3 / 2) * (4 / 6) = 2.

Now, we need to compare this result with the other two fractions:

(3 / 2) * (4 / 6) + (5 / 7)

We can't compare these yet because we don't know the results of these calculations.

8 / 8 = 1

Then, we multiply these two values together.

1.142857142857143 * 1 = 1.142857142857143

So, the comparison is 1.142857142857143 _ 1.142857142857143.

The comparison is (1.142857142857143 _ 1.142857142857143) _ (1.142857142857143 _ 1.142857142857143).

First, we need to calculate the values of the fractions.

1.670412962962963 _ 1.670412962962963 = 2.776574185296296

Then, we multiply these two values together.

2.776574185296296 * 2.776574185296296 = 7.787087092648148

The relationship between the two fractions can be determined by comparing their cross products. 

The cross product of two fractions is the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators. 

So, the cross product of (3 / 2) and (3 / 5) is (3 * 3) / (2 * 5) = 9 / 10.

Now, we need to compare this cross product with 1. 

If the cross product is less than 1, the relationship is (3 / 2) _ (3 / 5) &lt; 1.

If the cross product is greater than 1, the relationship is (3 / 2) _ (3 / 5) &gt; 1.

If the cross product is equal to 1, the relationship is (3 / 2) _ (3 / 5) = 1.

Let's calculate:

9 / 10 = 0.9

Since 0.9 is less than 1, the relationship is (3 / 2) _ (3 / 5) &lt; 1.

To compare the values of two fractions, we can cross multiply them and then compare the resulting numerators.

Cross multiplying the fractions gives us:

9 / 7 * 3 / 10

This simplifies to:

9*3 / 7*10

This simplifies further to:

27 / 70

So, (9 / 7) * (10 / 3) is ______ (3 / 10).

Let's calculate the value of the right side of the inequality:

3 / 10 = 0.3

Now, let's calculate the value of the left side of the inequality:

27 / 70 = 0.3857142857142857

So, (9 / 7) * (10 / 3) is ______ (3 / 10).

Comparing the two values, we find that (9 / 7) * (10 / 3) is ______ (3 / 10).

The expression (4 / 3) * (1 / 8) can be simplified by multiplying the numerators and the denominators separately.

4 / 3 * 1 / 8

This simplifies to (4 * 1) / (3 * 8), which equals 4 / 24.

However, we can also simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 4 and 24 is 4.

So, the simplified fraction is 1 / 6.

Therefore, (4 / 3) * (1 / 8) = 1 / 6.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we simplify the fractions. 

(9 / 6) simplifies to (9 / 6) = (9 / 6) = 1.5

(6 / 8) simplifies to (6 / 8) = (3 / 4) = 0.75

Then, we multiply the two simplified fractions. 

1.5 * 0.75 = &lt;&lt;1.5*0.75=1.125&gt;&gt;1.125

So, (9 / 6) * (6 / 8) = 1.125.

Now, we compare the two fractions:

(9 / 6) = (1.5)

and

(6 / 8) = (0.75)

Since 1.5 &gt; 0.75, the fraction (9 / 6) is greater than the fraction (6 / 8).

So, (9 / 6) _ (6 / 8) = &lt;&lt;(9 / 6) * (6 / 8)=1.125&gt;&gt;1.125.

To compare the fractions, we need to cross multiply them.

Cross multiplying gives us:

So, (9 / 6) _ (4 / 10) is ___ (35 / 12).

To find out whether it's less than, greater than, or equal to 35/12, we can cross multiply again:

4 / 35

Since 4/35 is less than 1, we can conclude that (9 / 6) _ (4 / 10) is less than 35/12.

            Compare the two fractions by filling in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =.

(6 / 8) _ (4 / 9)

To compare two fractions, we can cross-multiply them and then compare the resulting numerators.

6/8 _ 4/9 = 24/72 _ 36/36 = 864/3240

And 

6/8 _ 4/9 = 24/72 _ 36/36 = 864/3240

So, (6 / 8) _ (4 / 9) = 864/3240.

Now, we need to compare 864/3240 with 1.

864/3240 _ 3240/3240 = 864/3240 = 1

So, (864/3240) _ (3240/3240) = 1.

Therefore, (6 / 8) _ (4 / 9) = 864/3240 = 1.

So, (6 / 8) _ (4 / 9) = 1.
