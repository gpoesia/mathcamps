            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
The total energy required for the robot to run for 2 hours is 10 units for the first hour and 'w' units for the second hour. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

10 + w = 13

Solving for 'w', we get:

w = 13 - 10

w = 3

So, the robot needs 3 extra units of energy to run for the additional hour.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total number of rings before adding more is 10. After adding more, the total number of rings is 18. The difference between the two is 8. The number of rings added is 8.

Let's denote the number of rings added as h.

So, 10 + h = 18.

Solving for h, we get h = 18 - 10 = &lt;&lt;18-10=8&gt;&gt;8.

So, the jeweler added 8 rings.

Reasoning: The guitar started with 10 strings. After some strings broke, it was left with 10 strings. This means that the number of broken strings (e) plus the number of remaining strings (10) equals 10. Therefore, e + 10 = 10. Solving for e gives e = 10 - 10 = 0.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: Let's denote the number of coins the pirate buried the first day as 'd'. Then, the pirate buried 'd' coins the first day and 'd+5' coins the second day. The total number of coins the pirate buried is 'd' + 'd+5' = 10.

Solving this equation for 'd' gives us 'd' = 10 - 'd+5' = 10 - 5 = 5.

So, the pirate buried 5 gold coins the first day.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The store received 14 tubes of toothpaste. Since each box contains 10 tubes, the number of full boxes that were received is 14/10 = &lt;&lt;14/10=1.4&gt;&gt;1.4 boxes. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round down to 1 box.
The number of tubes that did not come from a full box is 14 - 1*10 = &lt;&lt;14-1*10=4&gt;&gt;4 tubes.
