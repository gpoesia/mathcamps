            Steve started with 38 dollars and spent it evenly over 8 days. Then he received an extra 11 dollars. John started with 18 dollars but then he spent the same amount of money as Steve had. John found 25 dollars on the street. How much money does John have now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: Steve spent 38 dollars evenly over 8 days, so he spent 38/8 = &lt;&lt;38/8=4.75&gt;&gt;4.75 dollars per day.
He received an extra 11 dollars, so he has 38+11 = &lt;&lt;38+11=49&gt;&gt;49 dollars.
John spent the same amount of money as Steve had, so he spent 49/8 = &lt;&lt;49/8=6.125&gt;&gt;6.125 dollars per day.
John found 25 dollars on the street, so he has 18+25 = &lt;&lt;18+25=43&gt;&gt;43 dollars.
Therefore, John has 43 dollars now.

            Sally wants to measure the distance of her bike route. Initially, she hesitates and travels only 47/50 of a mile. Then, she gains confidence and rides another 31 miles. Every day for the next 28 days, she completes the same distance.

One day, she decided to detour and added an extra 32/24 miles to her regular bike route. How many miles in total did she travel after adding the extra traveling distance?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning:
Sally initially travels 47/50 * 1 = &lt;&lt;47/50*1=0.94&gt;&gt;0.94 miles.
Sally then travels 31 miles.
Every day for the next 28 days, she travels 31 miles.
So, in total, she travels 0.94 + 31 + 31*28 = &lt;&lt;0.94+31+31*28=910.94&gt;&gt;910.94 miles.

Then, she decides to detour and adds an extra 32/24 * 1 = &lt;&lt;32/24*1=1.33&gt;&gt;1.33 miles to her regular bike route.
So, in total, she travels 910.94 + 1.33 = &lt;&lt;910.94+1.33=912.27&gt;&gt;912.27 miles.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, she expands the garden by 30 more feet. This makes the garden 11 + 30 = &lt;&lt;11+30=41&gt;&gt;41 feet long.
Then, she further extends the garden by 30 divided by 13 = &lt;&lt;30/13=2.3076923076923075&gt;&gt;2.3076923076923075 feet.
The total length of her garden after all the expansions is 41 + 2.3076923076923075 = &lt;&lt;41+2.3076923076923075=43.307692307692306&gt;&gt;43.307692307692306 feet.

            John wants to save some money to buy a video game. The game costs $40, but John already has $29. 

Every week, John is able to save 20/48 of the money he needs. 

After a certain period of time, he decides to put all his savings so far into an investment account. The account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested after a year. 

How much money will John have in his investment account after a year?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning:
First, we need to calculate how much money John needs to save to buy the game. This is $40 - $29 = &lt;&lt;40-29=11&gt;&gt;11.

Then, we need to calculate how much money John will save in a week. This is 20/48 * 11 = &lt;&lt;20/48*11=0.4375*11=5.125&gt;&gt;5.125.

After a year, John will have saved 5.125 * 52 = &lt;&lt;5.125*52=265.625&gt;&gt;265.625.

Finally, we need to calculate how much money John will have in his investment account after a year. This is 41/11 * 265.625 = &lt;&lt;41/11*265.625=1099.730769230769&gt;&gt;1099.730769230769.

Therefore, John will have $1099.730769230769 in his investment account after a year.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The first rock was moved for an interval of 20/50 hours, and the second was moved for an interval of 45/36 hours. 

The total time Tom moved the rocks is the sum of the intervals for each rock. 

The total distance Tom moved the rocks is the total time multiplied by the speed at which he moved them.

First, we need to convert the fractions to decimals. 

20/50 = 0.4 hours
45/36 = 1.25 hours

The total time Tom moved the rocks is 0.4 + 1.25 = &lt;&lt;0.4+1.25=1.65&gt;&gt;1.65 hours.

The total distance Tom moved the rocks is 1.65 * 25/22 = &lt;&lt;1.65*25/22=2.695238095238095&gt;&gt;2.695238095238095 miles.

So, Tom moved the rocks 2.695238095238095 miles today.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
First, we need to find the total amount of juice in the two containers.

The total amount of juice in the two containers is 23/35 + 50/41 = &lt;&lt;23/35+50/41=137/1435&gt;&gt;137/1435 gallons.

Then, we need to find the amount of juice that can be transferred into the bottle.

The amount of juice that can be transferred into the bottle is min(137/1435, 28) = &lt;&lt;min(137/1435, 28)=237/1435*28&gt;&gt;237/1435*28 gallons.

Finally, we subtract the amount of juice that was drunk by the customer from the amount of juice in the bottle.

The amount of juice left in the bottle is 237/1435*28 - 11/19 = &lt;&lt;237/1435*28-11/19=10043/1435-11/19=10043/1435*19-11/19=10043/1435*18&gt;&gt;10043/1435*18-11/19 gallons.

So, the amount of space left in the bottle after subtracting 11/19 gallon which was drunk by a customer is 10043/1435*18-11/19 = &lt;&lt;10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*18-11/19=10043/1435*</pre>

Reasoning: The total cost of a custom design is the cost of the regular cake plus the additional fee for the design. The additional fee is $6 divided by the 26 available designs. So, the total cost is $47 plus $6 divided by 26.

total_cost = regular_cake_cost + additional_fee

            John bought a drone that can fly 3 kilometers, but when it's carrying a delivery package, it can only fly 50 / 43 kilometers less. When the drone is attached with an additional booster, it can fly an additional 47 / 15 kilometers. How far can the drone fly with the package and the additional booster attached?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The drone can fly 3 kilometers without any attachments. When it's carrying a delivery package, it can only fly 3 - 50 / 43 = &lt;&lt;3-50/43=2.79&gt;&gt;2.79 kilometers. When the drone is attached with an additional booster, it can fly an additional 47 / 15 = &lt;&lt;47/15=3.13&gt;&gt;3.13 kilometers. So, the drone can fly 2.79 + 3.13 = &lt;&lt;2.79+3.13=5.92&gt;&gt;5.92 kilometers with the package and the additional booster attached.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, Alex finds $47/36 and adds it to his $13/10. This gives him $13/10 + $47/36 = &lt;&lt;13/10+47/36=100/36&gt;&gt;100/36.
Then, Alex duplicates this amount by 43 times. This gives him 100/36 * 43 = &lt;&lt;100/36*43=13800/36&gt;&gt;13800/36.
Finally, we simplify the fraction 13800/36 to get the final answer.

Final answer: $&lt;&lt;13800/36=375&gt;&gt;375.

Reasoning: 
The rate of consumption of apples is 17 pounds/8 days = &lt;&lt;17/8=2.125&gt;&gt;2.125 pounds per day.
The rate of consumption of apple juice is 48 ounces/42 days = &lt;&lt;48/42=1.1428571428571428&gt;&gt;1.1428571428571428 pounds per day.
The rate of consumption of apples to apple juice is 2.125/1.1428571428571428 = &lt;&lt;2.125/1.1428571428571428=1.8461538461538463&gt;&gt;1.8461538461538463 times.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The cargo ship carries 17 / 26 tons of cargo for every one of its 39 containers. So, the total tonnage of the cargo it can carry is 17 / 26 * 39 = &lt;&lt;17/26*39=32.65&gt;&gt;32.65 tons.
The existing cargo load of the ship is 50 / 11 tons.
The total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after it loads all 39 containers is the total tonnage of the cargo it can carry plus the existing cargo load.
So, the total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after it loads all 39 containers is 32.65 + 50 / 11 = &lt;&lt;32.65+50/11=43.23&gt;&gt;43.23 tons.

Reasoning: 
First, you pour out 5/40 gallons of water from the tank. This leaves you with 27/6 - 5/40 = &lt;&lt;27/6-5/40=27/6-1/8=27*8/6*8-1/8=27*4-1=107-1=106&gt;&gt;106/6 = 17.666666666666668 gallons of water.
Then, you add 21/26 gallons more. This makes the total amount of water in the tank 17.666666666666668 + 21/26 = &lt;&lt;17.666666666666668+21*6/26*6=17.666666666666668+21/13=17.666666666666668+1.6153846153846154=19.282051721153847&gt;&gt;19.282051721153847 gallons of water.

Reasoning: The new vendor charges $19 per 30 bags, which is equivalent to $19/30 per bag. The old vendor charges $34 per 8 bags, which is equivalent to $34/8 per bag.
The difference in price per bag is $19/30 - $34/8 = &lt;&lt;19/30-34/8=-5/120&gt;&gt;-5/120.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Coder 33B:</span>

The amount of money left in the savings account is 15 - 0.7391304347826086 = &lt;&lt;15-0.7391304347826086=14.26086956521739&gt;&gt;14.26086956521739 dollars.
