50 = 300 - (70 + 36 + 53 + 45)
50 = 300 - 169

The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of its side lengths. So, we know that the sum of the side lengths of the nonagon is 521cm.

The side lengths of the nonagon are 14cm, 94cm, 3cm, 20cm, 57cm, 83cm, 96cm, 85cm, and the ninth side.

Therefore, the sum of the side lengths of the nonagon is 14 + 94 + 3 + 20 + 57 + 83 + 96 + 85 + ninth side = 521cm.

Solving this equation for the ninth side gives:

ninth side = 521cm - (14 + 94 + 3 + 20 + 57 + 83 + 96 + 85)

Let's calculate it:

ninth side = 521cm - 435

ninth side = 521cm - 435 = 96cm

So, the length of the ninth side is 96cm.

The perimeter of a polygon is calculated by multiplying the number of sides by the length of each side. In this case, the number of sides is 8 and the total perimeter is 160m.

So, the length of each side, s, is given by the equation:

8s = 160

We can solve this equation to find the length of each side.

First, divide both sides of the equation by 8:

s = 160/8

Then, simplify:

s = 20

So, each side of the octagon is 20m long.

The perimeter of a regular polygon is given by the formula:

P = n * s

where P is the perimeter, n is the number of sides, and s is the length of one side.

Given that the perimeter of the decagon is 960m, we can set up the equation:

960 = n * s

To find the length of one side, we can solve for s:

s = 960 / n

Given that the decagon has 10 sides, we can substitute n = 10 into the equation:

s = 960 / 10

So, the length of one side of the decagon is 960/10 = &lt;&lt;960/10=96&gt;&gt;96m.

The total perimeter of a regular polygon is the length of the side times the number of sides. So, if the total perimeter is 203m and the polygon is a heptagon (7 sides), we can find the length of each side by dividing the total perimeter by the number of sides.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
total_perimeter = 203
num_sides = 7
side_length = total_perimeter / num_sides
print(side_length)

Reasoning: The perimeter of a regular decagon is given by the formula:

P = n*s

where P is the perimeter, n is the number of sides, and s is the length of each side.

In this case, n = 10 (since a decagon has 10 sides) and P = 360m.

So, s = P/n = 360m/10 = &lt;&lt;360/10=36&gt;&gt;36m.

Therefore, each side of the decagon has a length of 36m.

Solving this equation for x gives us the length of the tenth side.

Let's solve this problem using Python:

```python
# define the known side lengths
known_sides = [54, 49, 85, 48, 85, 19, 94, 44, 54]

# calculate the total perimeter of the decagon
total_perimeter = 575

# calculate the sum of the known side lengths
known_sides_sum = sum(known_sides)

# calculate the length of the tenth side
tenth_side = total_perimeter - known_sides_sum

# print the length of the tenth side
print(tenth_side)
```

When you run this code, it will print the length of the tenth side.

The total perimeter of a polygon is the sum of its side lengths. So, we know that 6+85+83+73+25+66+54+87+21 = 522.

We also know that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a polygon is greater than the length of the third side. This is known as the triangle inequality.

Given that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a polygon is greater than the length of the third side, we can infer that the tenth side of the polygon must be less than 21m.

However, if we subtract the sum of the lengths of the first nine sides from the total perimeter, we get the length of the tenth side.

So, 522 - (6+85+83+73+25+66+54+87+21) = 522 - 500 = 22m.

Reasoning:
The total perimeter of a polygon is the sum of its side lengths. So, we know that the sum of the known side lengths is 350cm.

We can calculate the sum of the known side lengths:

30cm + 18cm + 68cm + 23cm + 72cm + 57cm + 33cm + 19cm = &lt;&lt;30+18+68+23+72+57+33+19=322&gt;&gt;322cm

The length of the unknown ninth side is the total perimeter minus the sum of the known side lengths:

350cm - 322cm = &lt;&lt;350-322=28&gt;&gt;28cm

So, the length of the unknown ninth side is 28cm.

We can solve for s by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

s = 287m / 7

We are asked to find the length of the last unknown side. This side is not given in the problem statement, but it is the last side in the list of given sides.

So, we can subtract the sum of the known sides from the total perimeter to find the length of the last side.

59 + 16 + 15 + 35 + 89 + 16 + 43 = 286 - 7 = 279

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
The total perimeter of the polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. So, we can set up the equation 17 + 13 + 61 + 16 + 11 + 83 + 28 + 48 + 93 = 468.

The length of the tenth side is the difference between the total perimeter and the sum of the lengths of the first nine sides.

Let's solve this equation.

Reasoning:
17 + 13 + 61 + 16 + 11 + 83 + 28 + 48 + 93 - 468 = tenth side

Subtract the sum of the first nine sides from the total perimeter to find the length of the tenth side.

Reasoning:
468 - (17 + 13 + 61 + 16 + 11 + 83 + 28 + 48) = tenth side

Substitute the values into the equation.

Reasoning:
468 - 300 = tenth side

Subtract 300 from 468 to find the length of the tenth side.

Reasoning:
168 = tenth side

So, the length of the tenth side is 168 meters.

The formula for the perimeter of a regular polygon is n*s, where n is the number of sides and s is the length of each side.

Given that the perimeter of the heptagon is 637m, we can set up the equation 7*s = 637 to solve for s.

First, divide both sides of the equation by 7:

s = 637 / 7

Then, solve for s:

s = 91

Reasoning: The perimeter of a regular polygon is the length of the polygon's boundary. The formula for the perimeter of a regular polygon is P = n*s, where n is the number of sides and s is the length of each side.

In this case, the octagon is regular, so the perimeter is 800m. We know that the perimeter of a regular octagon is 8 times the length of one side. Therefore, we can set up the equation 800 = 8s and solve for s.

Let's solve it:

8s = 800
s = 100

So, each side of the octagon is 100m.

Reasoning: The total perimeter of a decagon is 10 times the length of one side. So, the length of one side is the total perimeter divided by 10.

Let's denote the length of one side as x. Then, the total perimeter is 10x.

The sum of the lengths of the sides of the decagon is 88 + 96 + 74 + 52 + 45 + 74 + 85 + 85 + 43 = &lt;&lt;88+96+74+52+45+74+85+85+43=682&gt;&gt;682m.

So, 10x = 682m, and x = 682/10 = &lt;&lt;682/10=68.2&gt;&gt;68.2m.

The length of the tenth side is the same as the length of one side, so it is also 68.2m.

Reasoning: The perimeter of a regular pentagon is given by the formula:

Perimeter = number of sides * side length

In this case, the number of sides is 5 and the total perimeter is 25cm.

So, the side length is given by the formula:

Side length = Perimeter / Number of sides

Side length = 25cm / 5 = &lt;&lt;25/5=5&gt;&gt;5cm

Therefore, the length of one of its sides is 5cm.

The total perimeter of a regular hexagon is 6 times the length of one of its sides. Therefore, the length of one side of the hexagon is 380m/6 = 63.33m.

The sum of the lengths of the five sides of the hexagon is 9m + 49m + 100m + 73m + 84m = 325m.

The length of the sixth side of the hexagon is the total perimeter of the hexagon minus the sum of the lengths of the five sides.

So, the length of the sixth side is 380m - 325m = 55m.

Therefore, the length of the sixth side of the hexagon is 55m.

The total perimeter of the polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. So, we can subtract the sum of the given side lengths from the total perimeter to find the length of the missing side.

Here is a Python code to solve this problem:

```python

side_lengths = [23, 67, 57, 94, 93, 18, 30]

# total perimeter
total_perimeter = 419

# calculate the sum of the given side lengths
sum_side_lengths = sum(side_lengths)

# calculate the length of the missing side
missing_side_length = total_perimeter - sum_side_lengths

print(missing_side_length)

Reasoning: The perimeter of a regular decagon is given by the formula:

P = n*s

where P is the perimeter, n is the number of sides (10 in this case), and s is the length of each side.

We can solve for s by dividing the total perimeter by the number of sides:

s = P/n

Substituting the given values:

s = 140/10

s = &lt;&lt;140/10=14&gt;&gt;14m

So, the length of each side of the decagon is 14m.

The total perimeter of the polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. So, we can set up the equation:

44 + 5 + 96 + 78 + 49 + 84 + 72 + 74 + 21 + 39 = 655

The 11th side is the difference between the total perimeter and the sum of the first 10 sides.

Let's calculate it:

1st_10_sides = 44 + 5 + 96 + 78 + 49 + 84 + 72 + 74 + 21
1st_10_sides = 441

11th_side = 655 - 441
11th_side = 214

So, the length of the 11th side is 214cm.

            A polygon has sides that measure 69m, 81m, 34m, 35m, and 38m respectively. If the polygon's total perimeter is 265m, what is the length of the remaining side?

The total perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. So, we know that 69 + 81 + 34 + 35 + 38 = 265.

The length of the remaining side is the total perimeter minus the sum of the known sides.

So, the length of the remaining side is 265 - (69 + 81 + 34 + 35 + 38) = 265 - 265 = 0.

Therefore, the length of the remaining side is 0m.

The total perimeter of a polygon is the sum of its side lengths. So, we can set up the equation 22 + 14 + 93 + 75 + x = 234.

Solving this equation gives us x = 234 - 22 - 14 - 93 - 75 = 15m.

Therefore, the length of the fifth side is 15m.
