The given equation is 122 = 92 + 28 * u.

We can solve this equation by dividing both sides by 28.

So, 122/28 = 92/28 + 28/28 * u

This simplifies to 4.5 + 1 * u.

Then, we can subtract 4.5 from both sides to get 1 * u.

So, u = 1.

Therefore, the solution for the variable u is 1.

i = 2.2857142857142856

The equation is 158 = ((19 * i) + 94).

Then, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 30. This gives us:

(134 - 54) / 30 = q

So, q = (134 - 54) / 30.

Then, we divide both sides by 23 to isolate h:

(9 + 70) / 23 = h

The given equation is an equation of the form ax = b, where a is the coefficient of x, x is the variable, and b is the constant term. To solve for 'j', we need to isolate 'j' on one side of the equation.

First, we need to rearrange the equation to isolate 'j'. We can do this by subtracting 23 from both sides of the equation, which gives us:

76 - 23 = 42 * j

Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 42 to isolate 'j':

(76 - 23) / 42 = j

This simplifies to:

33 / 42 = j

However, this is not the final answer. We need to simplify the fraction 33/42 to its simplest form. We can do this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3 (the greatest common divisor of 33 and 42).

33 / 3 = 11
42 / 3 = 14

The given equation is 179 = 82 * s + 80.

We can solve this equation by subtracting 80 from both sides to get rid of the constant term. This gives us 179 - 80 = 82 * s.

Then, we can divide both sides by 82 to solve for 's'. This gives us (179 - 80) / 82 = s.

Let's calculate it:

```python
# define the constants
total = 179
price = 82
constant = 80

# subtract the constant from the total
total_minus_constant = total - constant

# divide the result by the price
s = total_minus_constant / price

# print the result
print(s)
```

When you run this code, it will calculate the value of 's' and print it.

The given equation is 82 = ((27 * q) - 17).

First, we need to isolate the term with q on one side of the equation. This can be done by adding 17 to both sides of the equation. This gives us:

82 + 17 = ((27 * q) - 17) + 17

This simplifies to:

99 = (27 * q)

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 27 to solve for q. This gives us:

q = (99 / 27)

In Python, you can solve this equation as follows:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

q = symbols('q')

# define the equation
equation = Eq(82, ((27 * q) - 17))

# solve the equation

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for z:

z = (97 / 8)

The given equation is 12 = 63 - 50 * u.

We can solve this equation by isolating the term with the variable u on one side of the equation. This can be done by adding 63 to both sides of the equation.

This simplifies to 75 = 63 - 50 * u.

Then, we can add 50 * u to both sides of the equation to isolate u.

So, 75 + 50 * u = 63 - 50 * u + 50 * u

This simplifies to 125 * u = 63.

Finally, we can divide both sides of the equation by 125 to solve for u.

The given linear equation is 81 - 36 * r = 38.

We can solve this equation by isolating the variable r on one side of the equation.

First, we subtract 38 from both sides of the equation to get 81 - 38 = 36 * r.

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 36 to get (81 - 38) / 36 = r.

So, r = (81 - 38) / 36.

Let's calculate the value of r using Python:

```python
# define the values
numerator = 81 - 38
denominator = 36

# calculate r
r = numerator / denominator

# print the result
print(r)
```

When you run this code, it will print the value of r.

The given equation is 90 = 23 + (56 * a).

First, we need to isolate the term involving 'a'. This can be done by subtracting 23 from both sides of the equation. This gives us 56 * a = 90 - 23 = 67.

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 56 to solve for 'a'. This gives us a = 67 / 56.

Here is the Python code to solve this equation:

The given equation is 81 = 13 + 30 * h.

We can solve this equation by isolating the variable h on one side of the equation.

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 30 to get: (81 - 13) / 30 = h.

This simplifies to: 68 / 30 = h.

Finally, we can solve for h by dividing both sides by 68: h = 30 / 68.

The given equation is 95 = 3*r + 15.

We can solve this equation by subtracting 15 from both sides to get 95 - 15 = 3*r.

Then, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for 'r'.

So, 80 = 3*r.

Finally, we can divide both sides by 3 to get r = 80/3.

The value of 'r' is 80/3 = &lt;&lt;80/3=26.666666666666668&gt;&gt;26.666666666666668.

The equation is given as 93 = ((19 * r) + 2).

Then, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 19. This gives us:

The given equation is 56 = (70 * u) - 43.

We can solve this equation by isolating the variable 'u' on one side of the equation.

First, we add 43 to both sides of the equation to get:

56 + 43 = (70 * u)

Then, we subtract 43 from both sides of the equation to get:

(56 + 43) - 43 = (70 * u) - 43

This simplifies to:

56 = (70 * u) - 43

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 70 to isolate 'u':

56 / 70 = u - 43 / 70

Finally, we add 43 / 70 to both sides of the equation to get:

56 / 70 + 43 / 70 = u

This simplifies to:

(56 + 43) / 70 = u

Substituting the values into the equation gives:

(56 + 43) / 70 = u

Solving for 'u' gives:

u = (56 + 43) / 70

Substituting the values into the equation gives:

u = (108 + 43) / 70

Simplifying the equation gives:

u = 151 / 70

Finally, we can solve for 'u' by dividing 151 by 70:

u = 151 / 70

This simplifies to:

u = 2.157142857142856

So, the value of 'u' is 2.157142857142856.

The given equation is 62 = (u - 26). 

To solve for 'u', we need to isolate 'u' on one side of the equation. This can be done by adding 26 to both sides of the equation.

Therefore, u = 88.

The equation is 179 = ((63 * a) + 93). 

First, we need to isolate the variable a. This can be done by subtracting 93 from both sides of the equation. This gives us:

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 63. This gives us:

(179 - 93) / 63 = a

So, a = (179 - 93) / 63.

The given equation is 61 = (50 + (6 * g)).

We can solve this equation by subtracting 50 from both sides to get (61 - 50) = (6 * g).

So, 11 = (6 * g).

Dividing both sides by 6, we get g = 11/6.

However, this is not the simplest form of the solution. To find the simplest form, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6 to get 61 = 300 + 36g.

Then, subtract 300 from both sides to get 241 = 36g.

Finally, divide both sides by 36 to get g = 241/36.

So, the value of g is 241/36.

However, this is not the simplest form of the solution. To find the simplest form, we can divide both sides of the equation by 61 to get 1 = (50/61) + g.

Then, subtract (50/61) from both sides to get g = 1 - (50/61).

So, the value of g is 1 - (50/61).

However, this is not the simplest form of the solution. To find the simplest form, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 61 to get 61 = (50 * 61) + 61g.

Then, subtract (50 * 61) from both sides to get 61 = 3060 + 61g.

Finally, subtract 3060 from both sides to get 61g = 3060 - 3060.

So, the value of g is 0.

However, this is not the simplest form of the solution. To find the simplest form, we can divide both sides of the equation by 61 to get 1 = (50/61) + g.

So, the value of g is 0.

However, this is not the simplest form of the solution. To find the simplest form, we can divide both sides of the equation by 61 to get 1 = (50/61) + g.
