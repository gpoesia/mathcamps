Reasoning: The baby giraffe is 7.34 feet shorter than the full-grown giraffe. So, the full-grown giraffe is 7.34 feet + 40.4 feet = &lt;&lt;7.34+40.4=47.74&gt;&gt;47.74 feet tall.

Reasoning: The original price of the scooter was $59.9. The sale price is $39.3. The difference between these two amounts is the discount on the scooter.

$59.9 - $39.3 = &lt;&lt;59.9-39.3=20.6&gt;&gt;20.6

            A farmer sold a total of 111.94 kilograms of tomatoes. If each batch he sold weighs roughly 2.9 kilograms, how many batches of tomatoes did he sell?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total weight of the tomatoes sold by the farmer is 111.94 kilograms. Each batch of tomatoes weighs roughly 2.9 kilograms. To find out how many batches of tomatoes were sold, we divide the total weight by the weight of each batch.

So, 111.94 kilograms / 2.9 kilograms = &lt;&lt;111.94/2.9=38.58&gt;&gt;38.58 batches of tomatoes were sold.

However, since we can't sell a fraction of a batch, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, the farmer sold approximately 38 batches of tomatoes.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = length * width.

Given that the total area is 175.56 square feet and the length is 46.2 feet, we can set up the equation: 46.2 * width = 175.56.

Solving for width gives: width = 175.56 / 46.2.

Reasoning: The total snowfall was 509.39 inches. Each snowfall measured 38.3 inches. To find the number of snowfalls, we divide the total snowfall by the measurement of each snowfall.

Number of snowfalls = Total snowfall / Measurement of each snowfall

Number of snowfalls = 509.39 inches / 38.3 inches

Number of snowfalls = 509.39 inches ï¿½ 38.3 inches

Number of snowfalls = 13.33 snowfalls

However, since we can't have a fraction of a snowfall, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of snowfalls = 13 snowfalls

            A robot worker was able to complete 1402.7 units of work over a period of 84.5 hours. If the robot worked at a constant rate, how many units of work did it complete per hour?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The robot worked at a constant rate, so the total units of work completed divided by the total hours worked gives the rate at which the robot completed work.

Rate = Total units of work / Total hours worked

Rate = 1402.7 units / 84.5 hours

Rate = 1402.7 / 84.5

Rate = &lt;&lt;1402.7/84.5=16.6&gt;&gt;16.6 units per hour.

So, the robot completed 16.6 units of work per hour.

Reasoning: The total distance the toy car can travel on a single battery charge is 5460.48 meters. The battery lasts for 86.4 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the toy car is the total distance divided by the time.

Speed = 5460.48 meters / 86.4 minutes

Reasoning: The total distance is 1149.72 meters and the time span is 15.6 minutes. To find out how many meters the robot travels per minute, we divide the total distance by the time span.

So, speed (in meters per minute) = 1149.72 meters / 15.6 minutes = &lt;&lt;1149.72/15.6&gt;&gt;7.36 meters per minute.

Reasoning: The total weight of the two types of cheese when packaged together is 184.3 grams. The standard weight of the package is 72.5 grams. The manufacturer needs to subtract the difference between the total weight and the standard weight from the total weight to meet the standard.

Subtract (184.3 grams - 72.5 grams) = &lt;&lt;184.3-72.5=111.8&gt;&gt;111.8 grams.

So, the manufacturer needs to subtract 111.8 grams from the total weight of the combination of the two cheeses to meet the standard.
