        <pre class="model-raw-response">
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(length + width).
So, 324 = 2*(length + width)
Solving for width gives: width = 324/2 - length
Substituting the given length of 83 meters, we get: width = 324/2 - 83
Therefore, width = 324/2 - 83 = &lt;&lt;324/2 - 83=108&gt;&gt;108 meters.

Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is the length of each side multiplied by 4. So, if the perimeter is 40m, we can find the length of each side by dividing the perimeter by 4.

The length of each side = perimeter ï¿½ 4 = 40m ï¿½ 4 = &lt;&lt;40/4=10&gt;&gt;10m.

Therefore, the length of each side of the square is 10m.

            A rectangle has a perimeter of 194 cm. The length of one of its sides is 49 cm. Can you determine the length of its other side?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Yes, the length of the other side of the rectangle can be determined.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 2*(length + width).

Given that the perimeter is 194 cm and one side is 49 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula to solve for the other side.

2*(length + width) = 194
2*(49 + width) = 194
98 + 2*width = 194
2*width = 194 - 98
2*width = 96
width = 96/2
width = 48 cm

So, the length of the other side of the rectangle is 48 cm.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2*(length + width).
So, 282 = 2*(length + width)
Solving for width gives: width = 282/2 - length
Substituting the given length of 71 meters into this equation gives: width = 282/2 - 71
width = 71
Therefore, the length of the shorter side is 71 meters.

Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is the length of each side multiplied by 4. So, if the perimeter is 124m, we can find the length of each side by dividing the perimeter by 4.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(length + width).

Given that the perimeter is 138 feet and the length is 46 feet, we can set up the equation 2*(46 + width) = 138.

Solving for width gives us width = (138 - 2*46) / 2.

Let's calculate it.

Reasoning:
width = (138 - 2*46) / 2
    = (138 - 92) / 2
    = 46 / 2
    = 23

Therefore, the width of the rectangle is 23 feet.

            A quadrilateral has a perimeter of 205m. Two of its sides add up to 54m and the other two sides add up to 22m and 37m respectively. What is the length of the remaining side to complete the perimeter?

The sum of the lengths of all sides of a quadrilateral is equal to the perimeter. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two sides that add up to 54m and the two sides that add up to 22m and 37m is equal to 205m.

Let's denote the length of the two sides that add up to 54m as x and y. Then, the other two sides add up to 22m and 37m.

So, we have the following equation:

x + y + 22 + 37 = 205

Solving this equation for x and y gives:

x + y = 205 - 22 - 37 = &lt;&lt;205-22-37=160&gt;&gt;160

Therefore, the length of the remaining side to complete the perimeter is 160m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(length + width). 

Given that the perimeter of the field is 174m and the length of the field is 65m, we can set up the equation 2*(65 + width) = 174.

Solving for width gives:

2*65 + width = 174
130 + width = 174
width = 174 - 130
width = 44

So, the width of the field is 44m.

Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is the length of all sides added together. If we denote the length of one side of the square as 'x', then we have the equation x + x + x + x = 28. Solving this equation for 'x' gives us the length of one side of the square.

x = 28 / 4 = &lt;&lt;28/4=7&gt;&gt;7m.

So, the length of one side of the square is 7m.

The fourth side of the quadrilateral is the remaining length of the perimeter after subtracting the lengths of the first three sides.

So, the fourth side is 173m - 46m - 50m - 35m = &lt;&lt;173-46-50-35=0&gt;&gt;0m.

However, this is not possible because the sum of the lengths of the sides of a quadrilateral should be less than or equal to the perimeter. This means that the sum of the lengths of the sides should be less than or equal to 173m. In this case, 46m + 50m + 35m = 131m, which is less than 173m. Therefore, the lengths given for the sides of the quadrilateral do not form a valid quadrilateral.

The total perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(length + width).
So, we can set up the equation 2*(length + width) = 116 and solve for the width.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as 'l' and the width as 'w'.

From the problem, we know that l = 23m.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

2*(23 + w) = 116
2*23 + 2*w = 116
46 + 2*w = 116
2*w = 116 - 46
2*w = 66
w = 66/2
w = 33

So, the width of the rectangle is 33m.

Reasoning: The perimeter of a square is the length of each side multiplied by 4. So, if the perimeter is 104m, we can find the length of each side by dividing the perimeter by 4.

104m / 4 = &lt;&lt;104/4=26&gt;&gt;26m.

Therefore, the length of each side of the square is 26m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(length + width). Given that the perimeter is 198 cm and the length is 90 cm, we can set up the equation 2*(90 + width) = 198 and solve for width.

2*90 + 2*width = 198
180 + 2*width = 198
2*width = 198 - 180
2*width = 18
width = 18/2
width = 9 cm.

Therefore, the width of the rectangle is 9 cm.

The total perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. So, we can set up the equation 1m (first side) + 54m (second side) + 9m (third side) + 4th side = 81m.

We can solve this equation to find the length of the fourth side.

1m + 54m + 9m + 4th side = 81m
4th side = 81m - (1m + 54m + 9m)
4th side = 81m - 74m
4th side = 6m

So, the length of the fourth side is 6m.

Reasoning: The total length of the fence is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. Since the two opposite sides are the same length, they contribute twice their length to the total. The other two sides contribute once each. Therefore, the total length of the fence is 2 * 19m + 2 * x = 166m. Solving this equation for x gives us the length of each of the other two sides.

Reasoning: 2 * 19m + 2 * x = 166m
19m + 2x = 83m
2x = 83m - 19m
2x = 64m
x = 64m / 2
x = 32m

Therefore, the length of each of the other two sides is 32m.

            A quadrilateral has a perimeter of 246m. You know that two of its sides are 40m and 32m long, another side is 95m long. What is the length of the fourth side?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
The sum of the lengths of the sides of any quadrilateral is equal to its perimeter. So, we can set up the equation:

40 + 32 + 95 + x = 246

Solving this equation for x gives us the length of the fourth side.

Reasoning:

40 + 32 + 95 + x = 246
x = 246 - 40 - 32 - 95
x = 246 - 167
x = 79

Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 79m.

            A quadrilateral has a perimeter of 160m. If the three known sides have lengths of 29m, 16m, and 41m, what is the length of the fourth side?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The sum of the lengths of all sides of a quadrilateral is equal to its perimeter. Therefore, the fourth side of the quadrilateral is equal to the perimeter minus the sum of the known sides.

The fourth side = 160m - (29m + 16m + 41m) = 160m - 86m = 74m.

Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 74m.
