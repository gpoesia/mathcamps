Reasoning: The company has 2840 socks to package, and each pack contains 40 socks. So, they can make 2840/40 = &lt;&lt;2840/40=71&gt;&gt;71 packs.
The company currently has 93 packs, so they will have 93+71 = &lt;&lt;93+71=164&gt;&gt;164 packs in total once all the socks have been packaged.
After receiving an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues, they will have 164+70-8 = &lt;&lt;164+70-8=222&gt;&gt;222 packs of socks now.

Reasoning: The total number of windows produced in a month is 1767. The number of days in a month is 31. To find out how many windows the factory needs to produce each day, we divide the total number of windows by the number of days.

1767 / 31 = &lt;&lt;1767/31=56.57&gt;&gt;56.57 windows.

Since the factory can't produce a fraction of a window, it needs to produce 57 windows each day to meet its goal.

However, while he is distracted, a fairy takes away 8 gold coins from the pot. The new total of coins becomes a code to a magical lock.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning:
First, the leprechaun adds 39 gold coins to the pot.
Then, he adds another 47 gold coins to the pot.
The total number of gold coins in the pot is 39 + 47 = &lt;&lt;39+47=86&gt;&gt;86.
A fairy takes away 8 gold coins from the pot.
The new total of coins in the pot is 86 - 8 = &lt;&lt;86-8=78&gt;&gt;78.
The code to the magical lock is 78 + 48 = &lt;&lt;78+48=126&gt;&gt;126.
Finally, the code is multiplied by 24 to get the final value to unlock the magical lock.
126 * 24 = &lt;&lt;126*24=3024&gt;&gt;3024.

The leprechaun initially added 48 to the code, so the initial code was 126 - 48 = &lt;&lt;126-48=78&gt;&gt;78.

            A big grizzly bear feasts on 2726 ounces of salmon during a 58-day summer period. How much salmon does the bear eat each day on average?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The total amount of salmon eaten by the bear is 2726 ounces. The bear eats for 58 days. To find out how much salmon the bear eats each day, we divide the total amount of salmon by the number of days.

2726 ounces / 58 days = &lt;&lt;2726/58=47.15384615384615&gt;&gt;47.15384615384615 ounces per day.

Answer: The bear eats approximately 47.15 ounces of salmon each day.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The farmer collects the same amount of carrots every day, so the total amount of carrots he collects is the number of days he collects times the amount he collects each day.
The total amount of carrots from both patches is 26 + 16 = &lt;&lt;26+16=42&gt;&gt;42 carrots.
The total amount of carrots the farmer collects in 77 days is 42 * 77 = &lt;&lt;42*77=3354&gt;&gt;3354 carrots.

Reasoning: The total number of teddy bears produced is 7644. The number of days is 91. To find out how many teddy bears are produced each day, we divide the total number of teddy bears by the number of days.

7644 / 91 = &lt;&lt;7644/91=83.37&gt;&gt;83.37 teddy bears are produced each day.

However, since we can't have a fraction of a teddy bear, we round down to the nearest whole number.

So, approximately, the company makes 83 teddy bears each day.

Reasoning: The snail travels 66 inches in a day. It extracted energy from 704 lettuce leaves over 22 days, allowing it to move an additional inch per day.
So, the total distance the snail travels in a day is 66 inches (from walking) + 704/22 = &lt;&lt;704/22=32&gt;&gt;32 inches (from energy).
Therefore, the snail travels 66 + 32 = &lt;&lt;66+32=98&gt;&gt;98 inches in a day with the additional energy.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

Reasoning: The total revenue from selling hot chocolate is the price per cup times the number of cups sold.
The total revenue from selling marshmallows is the extra money made from selling marshmallows.
The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from hot chocolate and the revenue from marshmallows.

Revenue from hot chocolate = 42 dollars/cup * 78 cups = &lt;&lt;42*78=3316&gt;&gt;3316 dollars.
Revenue from marshmallows = 58 dollars.
Total revenue = 3316 dollars + 58 dollars = &lt;&lt;3316+58=3374&gt;&gt;3374 dollars.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning:
The total number of blankets made in the morning and afternoon is 13+81 = &lt;&lt;13+81=94&gt;&gt;94.
The total number of good blankets is 94-59 = &lt;&lt;94-59=35&gt;&gt;35.
The total value of the blankets sold is 39*35+35 = &lt;&lt;39*35+35=1380&gt;&gt;1380.

Reasoning: The manufacturer can produce 990 phones every 22 hours. This means they can produce 990/22 = &lt;&lt;990/22=45.45&gt;&gt;45.45 phones every hour.
After 33 hours, they add an additional 13 phones to the production batch.
So, the total number of phones produced in 33 hours is 45.45*33 = &lt;&lt;45.45*33=1529.35&gt;&gt;1529.35 phones.
The total number of phones produced in 33 hours plus the additional 13 phones is 1529.35 + 13 = &lt;&lt;1529.35+13=1542.35&gt;&gt;1542.35 phones.

            A puzzle game requires 3795 points to complete a level, but a player can only gain points in increments of 69. How many increments are needed to gain the points required to complete the level?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The player needs to gain points in increments of 69 to reach the required 3795 points. So, we divide the total points required by the increment size to find out how many increments are needed.

3795 / 69 = &lt;&lt;3795/69=55.38888888888889&gt;&gt;55.38888888888889 increments are needed.

However, since the player can only gain points in whole increments, we round up to the nearest whole number.

So, the player needs 56 increments to gain the points required to complete the level.

            On a particular beach, there is a tendency for 74 seashells to appear every day. After 42 days of collection, a beachcomber also discovered an additional 56 seashells that had been hidden in the sand. How many seashells did the beachcomber have in total after 42 days?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: The beachcomber had 74 seashells/day * 42 days = &lt;&lt;74*42=3048&gt;&gt;3048 seashells in 42 days.
The beachcomber also had 56 seashells in addition to the 42 days.
So, the beachcomber had 3048 + 56 = &lt;&lt;3048+56=3104&gt;&gt;3104 seashells in total after 42 days.
