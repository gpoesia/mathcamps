            At a party, 66 teenagers and 6 adults attend at first. Later on, the number of guests increases by 62. Near the end, an additional group of 52 people join the party. How many people attended the party in total?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: 
First, we add the number of teenagers and adults who attended the party. This gives us 66 + 6 = &lt;&lt;66+6=72&gt;&gt;72 people.
Then, we add the number of new people who joined the party. This gives us 72 + 62 = &lt;&lt;72+62=134&gt;&gt;134 people.
Finally, we add the number of people who joined the party at the end. This gives us 134 + 52 = &lt;&lt;134+52=186&gt;&gt;186 people.
So, the total number of people who attended the party is 186.

Reasoning: The total number of people at the party was the sum of the number of adults and children before and after the additional adults arrived.

Before the additional adults arrived, there were 74 adults and 58 children.

After the additional adults arrived, there were 74+20 = &lt;&lt;74+20=94&gt;&gt;94 adults and 58 children.

So, the total number of people at the party was 74+58 = &lt;&lt;74+58=132&gt;&gt;132 before and 94+58 = &lt;&lt;94+58=152&gt;&gt;152 after the additional adults arrived.

The river's length is the sum of the lengths of the calm water, the new tributary, and the rapid water stretch.

The total length of the river is 77 (the calm water) + 26 (the new tributary) + 99 (the rapid water stretch) = 77 + 26 + 99 = &lt;&lt;77+26+99=192&gt;&gt;192 miles.

Reasoning: The total number of tents is the sum of the small, large, and medium tents. The total number of ground mats remains the same.

Total number of tents = 8 (small) + 88 (large) + 17 (medium) = &lt;&lt;8+88+17=113&gt;&gt;113 tents.

Total number of ground mats remains the same, which is 77.

Total number of items for the camping trip = Total number of tents + Total number of ground mats = 113 (tents) + 77 (ground mats) = &lt;&lt;113+77=190&gt;&gt;190 items.

            A clothing designer is creating a custom shirt. The length of the shirt is 86 cm. The chest measurement is the length added by 11 cm. The waist measurement is the same as the sum of the two chest measurements. What is the waist measurement of the shirt in cm?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
The chest measurement is the length of the shirt (86 cm) plus 11 cm. So, the chest measurement is 86 cm + 11 cm = &lt;&lt;86+11=97&gt;&gt;97 cm.

The waist measurement is the sum of the two chest measurements, which is 97 cm (from the previous calculation) plus 97 cm. So, the waist measurement is 97 cm + 97 cm = &lt;&lt;97+97=194&gt;&gt;194 cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">
Reasoning: Let's denote the number of sandwiches Kevin made as x. Then, the number of sandwiches Sarah made is 80. The total number of sandwiches made by Kevin and Sarah is 80 + x = 33 more than the number of sandwiches made by Sarah, which is 80 + x = 80 + 33 = 113.

So, x = 113 - 80 = 33.

Therefore, Kevin made 33 sandwiches.

The score of the letter Z is 3.
The score of the letter U is the sum of 31 and the score of Z.
So, the score of the letter U is 31 + 3 = 34.

The score of the letter C is the sum of 69 and the score of U.
The score of the letter U is 34.
So, the score of the letter C is 69 + 34 = 103.

            Continuing with the same word game, let's change the rule a bit. Now, the letter Z is given a new score of 90. With the rule still in place that the score of the letter U is the sum of 31 and the score of Z, what is the new score of the letter U?

The score of the letter Z is now 90.
The score of the letter U is the sum of 31 and the score of Z.
So, the new score of the letter U is 31 + 90 = 121.

Reasoning: The new set of keys has 56 more than the original set. So, the original set has 56 less than the new set.
The total number of keys is the sum of the original set and the new set.
The original set has 56 less than the new set, so the original set has 56+56 = &lt;&lt;56+56=112&gt;&gt;112 keys.
The total number of keys is the sum of the original set and the new set.
