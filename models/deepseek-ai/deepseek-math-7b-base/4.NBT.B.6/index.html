        Following the scenario of the windmill and the small village, let's now consider that the windmill had a great day and managed to generate 506 units of power. However, due to development demands, the daily consumption of the village has increased to 920 units. At the end of the day, with the power being consumed in complete units, how much power is left over?

        The gardener's friend gave him an additional 183 grapes from his own garden. If the gardener decides to package these grapes as well into boxes with each box holding 380 grapes, how many grapes will remain after packaging the new grapes into as many boxes as possible?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: 192+183 = &lt;&lt;192+183=375&gt;&gt;375.
375/380 = &lt;&lt;375/380=0.98&gt;&gt;0.98.
The gardener can fill 0 boxes with 380 grapes each.
375-380*0 = &lt;&lt;375-380*0=375&gt;&gt;375 grapes will be left after the gardener has filled as many boxes as possible.

Since we can't have a fraction of a kid, we round down to 20.
708-20*34 = &lt;&lt;708-20*34=8&gt;&gt;8 kids will be waiting for their turn after all the swing sets are occupied.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        There are 976 tourists wanting to explore a castle. Each tour group throughout the day accommodates up to 530 people. After all the groups have taken off, how many tourists will be left for the last group of the day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: 976/530 = &lt;&lt;976/530=1.84&gt;&gt;1.84.
1.84 is not a whole number, so we need to round it down to 1.
1*530 = &lt;&lt;1*530=530&gt;&gt;530.
976-530 = &lt;&lt;976-530=446&gt;&gt;446.

        What would happen if the number of tourists wanting to explore the castle was still 976, but this time each group could accommodate up to 726 people? How many tourists would be left for the last group of the day now?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: 976/726 = &lt;&lt;976/726=1.34&gt;&gt;1.34.
1.34 is not a whole number, so we need to round it down to 1.
1*726 = &lt;&lt;1*726=726&gt;&gt;726.
976-726 = &lt;&lt;976-726=250&gt;&gt;250.
