            A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

            There were 47 inches of snowfall in January and an additional 7 inches in early February. On February 15th, there was an additional 17 inches of snowfall. Then, 48 inches of snow fell in March. In April, we had an additional 31 inches of snowfall early on, but then 27 inches melted by the end of the month. How many inches of snow does this sum up to at the end of April?

Now, the total number of times she used all her pencils is equivalent to the times she used her blue pencils added to the times she used her green and red pencils. How many times in total did she use all her pencils?

            Now, instead of having only 9 red colored pencils, Jenny actually had 12 of them. She again has green colored pencils which, as before, total 38 minus the number of red colored pencils. The total number of times she used all the pencils is the product of the number of green and red pencils she has, just as in the previous case. Now, with this change, how many times did she use all her pencils?

            You are mixing paints to create different shades. In one mixture, you have 41 drops of red paint. You then add 13 drops of white paint and the same amount of red paint as before. You take a sample of this mixture, which is 34 drops, and add that to a new mixture. Then take away the same amount of the 34 drop sample that you took originally. How many drops of paint are there in the new mixture?

            In the previous magical scenario, consider that instead of initially having 42 rainbow pebbles, the unicorn started with just 40. It still finds 26 more the following day. Maintaining his stash of 44 dreamberries, the unicorn still accumulates 33 more rainbow pebbles and adds them to the dreamberries. Once again, the unicorn ventures to obtain an additional 40 magical dandelions, but unfortunately, he loses 14. After these events, how many items does the unicorn have?

            A gardener planted 13 Sunflowers in his garden. The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed. By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on and the spots needed, then he doubled that total for no particular reason. How many did he end up with?

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

            There are 6 confirmed UFO sightings in a small city. After a viral event, sightings increase by a daily average obtained by dividing an additional 504 sightings over the next 14 days. Subtract the initial confirmed sightings from this new daily average. Then, multiply it by the result of taking the maximum number of sightings recorded in one day (9) and subtracting the number you would typically dismiss as random (3). How many sightings are there according to this calculation?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The new daily average is 504/14 = &lt;&lt;504/14=36&gt;&gt;36.
The result of taking the maximum number of sightings recorded in one day (9) and subtracting the number you would typically dismiss as random (3) is 9-3 = &lt;&lt;9-3=6&gt;&gt;6.

            Lemonville is a small village known for its lemon trees. One year, the villagers picked 38 baskets of lemons from the trees near the river and 24 baskets from the ones near an old well. From the trees near the school, they picked 16 more baskets and from the trees near the mayor's house, they picked 13 more baskets. They realized that their lemons were heavier and they could extract more juice so they decided to get 35 baskets to make lemonade. If each basket of lemons could produce 14 bottles of lemonade, how many bottles of lemonade would they get from the remaining baskets?

            The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            A turtle decides to swim. One day, it travels as many leagues as 11 plus 10, then multiplies that by 16 to get the total distance it swam that week. Later, it realized it had over calculated the distance by 41 leagues. What is the real distance it swam that week?

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The turtle swam 11+10 = &lt;&lt;11+10=21&gt;&gt;21 leagues on the first day, and 21*16 = &lt;&lt;21*16=336&gt;&gt;336 leagues on the second day.
The turtle swam 336-41 = &lt;&lt;336-41=295&gt;&gt;295 leagues altogether.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Continuing from the previous scenario, consider that the turtle realizes that it originally miscalculated the daily travel distance. Instead of swimming 11 leagues plus 10 a day, it actually swam 11 leagues plus 17 leagues a day. After multiplying that daily total by 16 for the week, and subtracting the over-calculated 41 leagues, how much did the turtle actually swim in the originally estimated week?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: The turtle swam 11+17 = &lt;&lt;11+17=28&gt;&gt;28 leagues on the first day, and 28*16 = &lt;&lt;28*16=448&gt;&gt;448 leagues on the second day.
The turtle swam 448-41 = &lt;&lt;448-41=407&gt;&gt;407 leagues altogether.
