            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            After reflecting on her toy buying habits, Mommy realizes that she bought too many toys in the beginning. Instead of buying 5 new toys every month for 10 months, she now remembers that there was a month when she didn't buy any toys. Therefore, she only bought 5 toys per month for 9 months. How many toys did she actually buy during that period?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">  Reasoning: Mommy bought 5 toys in the first month, 5 toys in the second month, 5 toys in the third month, 5 toys in the fourth month, 5 toys in the fifth month, 5 toys in the sixth month, 5 toys in the seventh month, 5 toys in the eighth month, and 5 toys in the ninth month.
So, Mommy bought 5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5 = &lt;&lt;5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5=45&gt;&gt;45 toys in total.
