            Continuing from the previous scenario, let's suppose the colonial fireplace in the early morning burns firewood at a slightly different rate of 8/15 cords per hour instead of 4/15 cords per hour.  The late night burning rate remains the same at 14/15 cords per hour. Given these new circumstances, how much firewood does the fireplace burn in total in one hour split between the early morning and late night?
