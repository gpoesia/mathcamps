We are given that the volume of the tank is 512 m^3, so we can set up the equation:
512 = s^3
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
s = 8
So, the size of one side of the tank is 8 meters.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Math 7B Base:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cuboid is given by the formula V = lwh, where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height of the cuboid, respectively. Since all of the sides of the cuboid are of equal length, we have l = w = h. Therefore, the volume of the cuboid can be written as V = l^3.
Substituting the given volume of 64 km^3, we get 64 = l^3.
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get l = 4.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Math 7B Base:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cuboid is given by the formula:
V = lwh
where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.
Since the slide has the same length, width, and height, we can set l = w = h.
Substituting this into the formula, we get:
V = l^3
Solving for l, we get:
l = cuberoot(V)
Substituting the given volume of 1000 cubic feet, we get:
l = cuberoot(1000)
Using a calculator, we find that:
l = &lt;&lt;cuberoot(1000)=10&gt;&gt;10

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of one edge.
We can solve for s by taking the cube root of both sides of the equation:
s = 3âˆšV
Plugging in the value of V = 27, we get:
s = 3âˆš27
s = 3

We are given that the volume of the snail's shell is 27 cm^3.
We can use this information to solve for the length of each side of the snail's shell.
27 = s^3
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
s = 3
Therefore, the length of each side of the snail's shell is 3 cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of each side.
We are given that the volume of the oven is 125 cubic inches.
We can use the formula to find the length of each side of the loaf:
125 = s^3
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
s = 5
Therefore, the length of each side of the loaf is 5 inches.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek Math 7B Base:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The volume of a cuboid is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.
Since the height and width are the same, we can write the volume as V = lw^2.
We are given that V = 8, so we can write 8 = lw^2.
We can solve for l by dividing both sides by w^2: l = 8/w^2.
We can solve for w by taking the square root of both sides: w = sqrt(8/l).
We can solve for h by dividing both sides by lw: h = 8/(lw).
We can solve for lw by dividing both sides by h: lw = 8/h.
We can solve for lh by dividing both sides by w: lh = 8/w.
We can solve for wh by dividing both sides by l: wh = 8/l.
We can solve for lwh by dividing both sides by h: lwh = 8/h.
We can solve for lwhh by dividing both sides by w: lwhh = 8/w.
We can solve for lwhhh by dividing both sides by l: lwhhh = 8/l.
We can solve for lwhhhh by dividing both sides by h: lwhhhh = 8/h.
We can solve for lwhhhhh by dividing both sides by w: lwhhhhh = 8/w.
We can solve for lwhhhhh by dividing both sides by l: lwhhhhh = 8/l.
We can solve for lwhhhhhh by dividing both sides by h: lwhhhhhh = 8/h.

We can solve for lwhhhhhhhh by dividing both sides by l: lwhhhhhhhh = 8/l.
We can solve for lwhhhhhhhhh by dividing both sides by h: lwhhhhhhhhh = 8/h.
We can solve for lwhhhhhhhhhh by dividing both sides by w: lwhhhhhhhhhh = 8/w.
We can solve for lwhhhhhhhhhhh by dividing both sides by l: lwhhhhhhhhhhh = 8/l.
We can solve for lwhhhhhhhhhhhh by dividing both sides by h: lwhhhhhhhhhhhh = 8/h.
We can solve for lwhhhhhhhhhhhhh by dividing both sides by w: lwhhhhhhhhhhhhh = 8/w.
