        A rectangle has a perimeter of 194 cm. The length of one of its sides is 49 cm. Can you determine the length of its other side?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response"> Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of its four sides.
Let's call the length of the other side x.
The perimeter of the rectangle is 194 cm, so we can write:
49 + 49 + x + x = 194
Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
98 + 2x = 194
Subtracting 98 from both sides, we get:
2x = 96
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 48
Therefore, the length of the other side of the rectangle is 48 cm.
