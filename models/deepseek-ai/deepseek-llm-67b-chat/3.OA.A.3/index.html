To find out how many coops are needed to house all the hens, we need to divide the total number of hens by the number of hens each coop can hold.

Number of coops = Total number of hens / Number of hens each coop can hold
Number of coops = 24 hens / 12 hens per coop
Number of coops = 2

So, 2 coops are needed to house all the hens.

Each fairy creates triplets of herself, so the number of fairies will triple after each fairy uses their ability.

Initially, there are 3 fairies.
After the first fairy uses her ability, there will be 3 * 3 = 9 fairies.
After the second fairy uses her ability, there will be 9 * 3 = 27 fairies.
After the third fairy uses her ability, there will be 27 * 3 = 81 fairies.

To find out how many groups she would have now, we divide the total number of feathers by the number of feathers in each group.

John's room requires 12 carpet tiles to cover the floor.
Since each carpet tile is the size of a single bed, the number of bed spaces in John's room is equal to the number of carpet tiles.

Jane initially gave 6 filters to each of her 5 cameras, which means she gave out a total of 6 * 5 = 30 filters.
Since she had 10 filters in total, she would have 10 - 30 = -20 filters left.
Since the number of filters left is negative, it means Jane initially gave out more filters than she had.
Therefore, it is not possible for Jane to have initially given 6 filters to each camera.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            After reflecting on her toy buying habits, Mommy realizes that she bought too many toys in the beginning. Instead of buying 5 new toys every month for 10 months, she now remembers that there was a month when she didn't buy any toys. Therefore, she only bought 5 toys per month for 9 months. How many toys did she actually buy during that period?
