        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.
We are given the perimeter (P = 324 meters) and the length (L = 83 meters). We need to find the width (W).

Solution:
We can rearrange the formula to solve for W: W = (P/2) - L
Substituting the given values, we get: W = (324/2) - 83
W = 162 - 83
W = 79

The width of the pool is 79 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The perimeter of a square is the sum of all four sides. Since all sides of a square are equal in length, we can divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of each side.

Let's denote the length of each side as 's'.

Perimeter = 4s

Given that the perimeter is 40m, we can set up the equation:

40 = 4s

Now, we can solve for 's':

s = 40 / 4
s = 10

So, the length of each side of the square is 10 meters.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the length of the unknown side as x. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 2*(length + width). In this case, the perimeter is 194 cm and the length of one side is 49 cm.

So, we can set up the equation as follows:

2*(49 + x) = 194

Now, we can solve for x:

98 + 2x = 194

Subtract 98 from both sides:

2x = 96

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 48

The length of the other side is 48 cm.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2L + 2W

We know that the perimeter is 52 meters, and one side (W) is 4 meters. We can substitute these values into the formula:

52 = 2L + 2(4)

Now, we can solve for L:

52 = 2L + 8
44 = 2L
L = 22

So, the length of the rectangle is 22 meters. The other side (W) is already given as 4 meters.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
Let's denote the lengths of the two unknown sides as x and y.
The perimeter of the quadrilateral is given as 229m, so we can write the equation:
93m + 98m + 36m + x + y = 229m
Combining like terms, we get:
227m + x + y = 229m
Subtracting 227m from both sides, we get:
x + y = 2m
Since we are looking for the length of the fourth side, we need to find the value of y.
We know that the third side is 36m long, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
x + 36m = 2m
Subtracting 36m from both sides, we get:
x = -34m
Since the length of a side cannot be negative, there is no solution for the length of the fourth side in this case.
The answer is: 36</pre>

The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since a square has four equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of one side.

Let's denote the length of one side as 's'.

Perimeter = 280m

s + s + s + s = 280m

4s = 280m

Now, we can solve for 's' by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

s = 280m / 4

s = 70m

The length of one side of the square is 70 meters.

The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
Let's denote the lengths of the two known sides as a and b, and the length of the third side as c.
The perimeter of the quadrilateral is given as P = a + b + c + d, where d is the length of the fourth side.
We are given that P = 219cm, a = 37cm, b = 98cm, and c = 41cm.
Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
219 = 37 + 98 + 41 + d
Now, we can solve for d:
219 = 176 + d
d = 219 - 176
d = 43
Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 43cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the length of the shorter side as x. Since the longer side is 71 meters, the total length of the two sides is 71 + x.
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all four sides, which in this case is 2 * (length + width).
So, we can write the equation as:
2 * (71 + x) = 282
Let's solve for x:
142 + 2x = 282
To isolate x, we subtract 142 from both sides of the equation:
142 + 2x - 142 = 282 - 142
2x = 140
To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
x = 140 / 2
x = 70
The length of the shorter side is 70 meters.

Let's denote the shorter side of the garden as 'a' and the longer side as 'b'. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 2*(length + width). In this case, the perimeter is 128 meters, and the shorter side is 57 meters.

So, we can write the equation as:
2*(a + b) = 128

We know that a = 57 meters. Now, we can substitute the value of 'a' into the equation:
2*(57 + b) = 128

Now, we can solve for 'b':
114 + 2b = 128
2b = 128 - 114
2b = 14
b = 14 / 2
b = 7

So, the other side (the longer side) of the garden is 7 meters long.

Let's denote the length of the unknown side as x. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can represent the perimeter as:

2 * length + 2 * width = 204

We know that one of the sides (length) is 16m, so we can substitute that into the equation:

2 * 16 + 2 * x = 204

Now, we can solve for x:

32 + 2x = 204

Subtract 32 from both sides:

2x = 172

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 86

The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 236 cm. We know the lengths of three sides, so we can find the length of the fourth side by subtracting the sum of the known side lengths from the perimeter.

Let's denote the lengths of the known sides as a, b, and c, and the length of the unknown side as d. We have:

a = 69 cm
b = 50 cm
c = 39 cm

The perimeter P is given by:

P = a + b + c + d

We can plug in the known values and solve for d:

236 = 69 + 50 + 39 + d

Now, we can simplify and solve for d:

236 = 158 + d

d = 236 - 158

d = 78 cm

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.
We are given that the perimeter is 228 meters and the length is 90 meters. We can substitute these values into the formula and solve for the width.
228 = 2(90) + 2W
228 = 180 + 2W
To isolate W, we subtract 180 from both sides of the equation:
228 - 180 = 180 - 180 + 2W
48 = 2W
To solve for W, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the length of the opposite side as x. Since the rectangle has a total perimeter of 236 meters, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 43 meters and the width is x meters. So, we can write the equation as:

236 = 2 * (43 + x)

Now, we can solve for x:

236 = 86 + 2x

Subtract 86 from both sides:

236 - 86 = 86 - 86 + 2x

150 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

150 / 2 = 2x / 2

75 = x

So, the length of the opposite side is 75 meters.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 206m.
We know that two sides together have a length of 58m, and the other two sides together have a length of 54m and 1m, respectively.
Let's denote the missing side as x.
The sum of the lengths of all four sides is 206m, so we can write the equation as:
58m + 54m + 1m + x = 206m
Let's simplify and solve for x:
113m + x = 206m
To isolate x, we subtract 113m from both sides of the equation:
113m + x - 113m = 206m - 113m
x = 93m
The length of the missing portion of the perimeter is 93m.

The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4.
Let's denote the length of one side as &quot;s&quot;.
So, the perimeter of the square field is 4s.
We know that the perimeter is 284 meters.
Therefore, 4s = 284.
To find the length of one side, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4.
s = 284/4.
Calculating the value of s, we get s = 71.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.
We are given that the perimeter is 150 feet and the length is 69 feet.
We can substitute these values into the formula to find the width.
150 = 2(69) + 2W
150 = 138 + 2W
To isolate W, we subtract 138 from both sides of the equation.
150 - 138 = 138 - 138 + 2W
12 = 2W
To solve for W, we divide both sides of the equation by 2.
12/2 = 2W/2
6 = W
The width of the rectangle is 6 feet.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(L + W)

We know that the perimeter is 166m, and one side (W) is 35m. We can plug these values into the formula and solve for the other side (L):

166 = 2(L + 35)

Now, we can solve for L:

166 = 2L + 70

Subtract 70 from both sides:

96 = 2L

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 48

So, the other side (L) is 48m.

s + s + s + s = 124

4s = 124

The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
Let's denote the length of the fourth side as x.
The perimeter of the quadrilateral is given as 199m.
So, the sum of the lengths of all its sides is 199m.
The length of the first side is 9m, the length of the second side is 30m, and the length of the third side is 71m.
Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the first three sides is 9m + 30m + 71m = 110m.
To find the length of the fourth side, we subtract the sum of the lengths of the first three sides from the perimeter of the quadrilateral.
So, x = 199m - 110m = 89m.
The length of the fourth side is 89m.

Substituting the given values, we get L = (384/2) - 99 = 192 - 99 = 93cm.
Therefore, the length of the longer side of the rectangle is 93cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
Let's denote the lengths of the first, second, third, and fourth sides as a, b, c, and d respectively.
We know that a = 78m, b = 15m, and c = 63m.
The perimeter of the quadrilateral is given as 255m.
So, a + b + c + d = 255m.
Substituting the known values, we get:
78m + 15m + 63m + d = 255m.
Combining like terms, we get:
156m + d = 255m.
Subtracting 156m from both sides, we get:
d = 255m - 156m.
d = 99m.
Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 99m.

The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since a square has four equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of one side.

Let's denote the length of one side as 's'.

Perimeter = 4 * s

Given that the perimeter is 128m, we can write:

128 = 4 * s

Now, we can solve for 's':

s = 128 / 4
s = 32

Now, we can solve for x:

96 = 66 + 2x
2x = 96 - 66
2x = 30

Let's denote the sides of the quadrilateral as a, b, c, and d. We know that a + b = 54m, c = 22m, and d = 37m. The perimeter of the quadrilateral is given by the formula:

Perimeter = a + b + c + d

We can substitute the given values into the formula:

205m = 54m + c + d

Now, we can substitute the values of c and d:

205m = 54m + 22m + 37m

Now, we can solve for the remaining side (a + b):

205m = 113m

To find the length of the remaining side, we subtract the sum of the known sides from the perimeter:

a + b = 205m - 113m = 92m

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.
We are given that the perimeter is 174m and the length is 65m. We can substitute these values into the formula to find the width.
174 = 2(65) + 2W
174 = 130 + 2W
To isolate W, we subtract 130 from both sides of the equation.
174 - 130 = 130 - 130 + 2W
44 = 2W
To solve for W, we divide both sides of the equation by 2.

The width of the field is 22m.

4x = 316

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 316 / 4

x = 79

So, the length of each side of the square is 79 meters.

The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since a square has four equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of each side.

Let's denote the length of each side as 's'.

Perimeter = 268 cm

s + s + s + s = 268

4s = 268

Now, we can solve for 's' by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

s = 268 / 4

s = 67

So, the length of each side of the square is 67 cm.

Let's denote the length of the fourth side as x.
The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
So, the perimeter of this quadrilateral is 81m + 100m + 19m + x = 243m.

Solution:
81m + 100m + 19m + x = 243m
200m + x = 243m
To isolate x, we subtract 200m from both sides of the equation:
200m + x - 200m = 243m - 200m
x = 43m
The length of the fourth side is 43m.

Let's denote the length of the unknown side as x. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the perimeter is 186cm, and we know that one side is 50cm long. Therefore, the other three sides have a combined length of 186 - 50 = 136cm.

Since the rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, the unknown side (x) and the other known side (50cm) form one pair, and the other pair has a combined length of 136 - 50 = 86cm.

Since the other pair of sides is equal, we can divide the combined length of 86cm by 2 to find the length of one side: 86 / 2 = 43cm.

So, the other side of the rectangle is 43cm long.

Let's denote the length of one side as 's'.

Perimeter = 4s

Given that the perimeter is 72 cm, we can set up the equation:

72 = 4s

Now, we can solve for 's':

s = 72 / 4
s = 18

So, the length of one side of the square is 18 cm.

Let's denote the width of the rectangle as w. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 2*(length + width).

We know the length of the rectangle is 23m and the total perimeter is 116m. We can substitute these values into the formula to find the width:

2*(23 + w) = 116

Now, we can solve for w:

46 + 2w = 116
2w = 116 - 46
2w = 70
w = 70 / 2
w = 35

The length of the width is 35m.

Let's denote the length of the fourth side as x. Since the quadrilateral has a total perimeter of 131m, the sum of the lengths of all four sides should be equal to 131m.

So, we can write the equation as:

24m + 57m + 17m + x = 131m

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 131m - (24m + 57m + 17m)
x = 131m - 98m
x = 33m

The length of the fourth side is 33m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the length of the unknown side as x. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can represent the perimeter as:

2 * length + 2 * width = 254

We know that one of the sides has a length of 89m, so we can substitute that into the equation:

2 * 89 + 2 * x = 254

Now, we can solve for x:

178 + 2x = 254

Subtract 178 from both sides:

2x = 76

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 38

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.
We are given that the perimeter is 198 cm and the length is 90 cm. We can substitute these values into the formula and solve for the width.

To isolate W, we subtract 180 from both sides of the equation:

Solving the equation:
x = 236 - (89 + 87 + 1)
x = 236 - 177
x = 59

The length of the fourth side is 59 units.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since a square has four equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 4 to find the length of each side.

Let's denote the length of each side as 's'.

Perimeter = 4s

We know that the perimeter is 340 meters.

340 = 4s

Now, we can solve for 's' by dividing both sides of the equation by 4.

s = 340 / 4

s = 85

So, the length of each side of the square is 85 meters.

Let's denote the length of the shorter sides as 'a' and the length of the longer sides as 'b'. We know that the total perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 2*(length + width).

In this case, we have:
2*(a + b) = 158

We also know that each of the shorter sides is 51 meters long, so:
a = 51

Now we can substitute the value of 'a' into the formula:
2*(51 + b) = 158

Let's solve for 'b':
102 + 2b = 158
2b = 158 - 102

b = 56 / 2
b = 28

Let's denote the length of the two sides that are 19m each as A and B, and the length of the other two sides as C and D. We know that A = B = 19m.

The total length of the fence is the sum of all four sides, so we have:

A + B + C + D = 166

Substituting A and B with 19m, we get:

19 + 19 + C + D = 166

Combining like terms, we have:

38 + C + D = 166

Now, we need to find the length of C and D. To do this, we can subtract 38 from both sides of the equation:

C + D = 166 - 38

C + D = 128

Since C and D are the lengths of the other two sides of the rectangle, they must be equal. Therefore, we can divide the sum by 2 to find the length of each side:

C = D = 128 / 2

C = D = 64

So, the length of each of the other two sides is 64m.</pre>

The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
Let's denote the length of the fourth side as x.
The perimeter of the quadrilateral is given as 246m.
So, the sum of the lengths of all its sides is 246m.
We know the lengths of three sides: 40m, 32m, and 95m.
Therefore, the sum of the lengths of these three sides is 40m + 32m + 95m = 167m.
To find the length of the fourth side, we subtract the sum of the lengths of the known sides from the perimeter of the quadrilateral:
246m - 167m = 79m.
So, the length of the fourth side is 79m.

12 meters / 4 = 3 meters

Answer: The length of one side of the square is 3 meters.</pre>

            A quadrilateral has a perimeter of 160m. If the three known sides have lengths of 29m, 16m, and 41m, what is the length of the fourth side?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the lengths of the three known sides as a, b, and c, and the length of the unknown side as d. We know that a = 29m, b = 16m, and c = 41m. The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Therefore, we can write the equation:

a + b + c + d = Perimeter

Substituting the known values, we get:

29 + 16 + 41 + d = 160

Now, we can solve for d:

d = 160 - (29 + 16 + 41)
d = 160 - 86
d = 74

So, the length of the fourth side (d) is 74m.</pre>

            A rectangle has a perimeter of 98m. If one of its sides is 5m long, what is the length of the other side?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the length of the unknown side as x. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 2*(length + width). In this case, the perimeter is 98m and one side is 5m long.

So, we can write the equation as:
2*(5 + x) = 98

Now, we can solve for x:
10 + 2x = 98
2x = 88
x = 44

The length of the other side is 44m.

            A rectangle has two sides measuring 45m each. If the total perimeter of the rectangle is 210m, what is the length of each of the other two sides?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.
We know that two sides of the rectangle measure 45m each, so the total length of these two sides is 2 * 45 = 90m.
We also know that the total perimeter of the rectangle is 210m.
So, we can set up the equation 210 = 2L + 2W, where L and W are the lengths of the other two sides.
We can substitute the known values into the equation: 210 = 2L + 2(90).
Simplifying the equation, we get 210 = 2L + 180.
Subtracting 180 from both sides, we get 30 = 2L.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get L = 15.
So, each of the other two sides of the rectangle measures 15m.
