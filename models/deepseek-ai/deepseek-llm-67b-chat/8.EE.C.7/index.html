        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

To solve the equation 122 = 92 + 28 * u for the variable u, we need to isolate u on one side of the equation.

Step 1: Subtract 92 from both sides of the equation.

122 - 92 = 92 + 28 * u - 92

30 = 28 * u

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 28.

30 / 28 = 28 * u / 28

30 / 28 = u

Step 3: Simplify the fraction.

30 / 28 = 15 / 14

u = 15 / 14

So, the value of u is 15/14.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

To solve the linear equation for the variable 's', we need to isolate 's' on one side of the equation.

The given equation is:

179 = 82 * s + 80

First, we need to subtract 80 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the right side:

179 - 80 = 82 * s + 80 - 80

99 = 82 * s

Now, we need to isolate 's' by dividing both sides of the equation by 82:

99 / 82 = 82 * s / 82

1.2 = s

So, the value of 's' is 1.2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation for the value of q, we will follow these steps:

1. Isolate the term with the variable q.
2. Simplify the equation.
3. Solve for q.

Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable q.

71 = ((24 * q) + 14)

Step 2: Simplify the equation.

71 = 24q + 14

Step 3: Solve for q.

To solve for q, we will subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:

71 - 14 = 24q + 14 - 14

57 = 24q

Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by 24 to isolate q:

57 / 24 = 24q / 24

q = 2.375

The value of q is 2.375.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To solve the equation 71 = 93 - (13 * d), we need to isolate the variable d.

Step 1: Add 13 * d to both sides of the equation to move the term with the variable to the left side.
71 + 13 * d = 93

Step 2: Subtract 71 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable.
13 * d = 93 - 71

Step 3: Simplify the right side of the equation.
13 * d = 22

Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 13 to solve for d.
d = 22 / 13

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation for u, follow these steps:

Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable u.
To do this, add 50 * u to both sides of the equation:

12 + 50 * u = 63 - 50 * u + 50 * u

Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation.

12 + 50 * u = 63

Step 3: Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable u.

50 * u = 63 - 12

Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation.

50 * u = 51

Step 5: Divide both sides of the equation by 50 to solve for u.

u = 51 / 50

Step 6: Simplify the fraction.

u = 1.02

So, the solution for the linear equation is u = 1.02.</pre>

To solve the equation for 'b', we need to isolate 'b' on one side of the equation.

Step 1: Subtract 42 from both sides of the equation.
60 - 42 = 42 + (10 * b) - 42

Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation.
18 = 10 * b

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 10.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation for the unknown variable h, we need to isolate h on one side of the equation.

The given equation is:

81 = 13 + 30 * h

First, we subtract 13 from both sides of the equation:

81 - 13 = 13 - 13 + 30 * h

68 = 30 * h

Now, we divide both sides of the equation by 30:

68 / 30 = 30 * h / 30

2.2666666666666665 = h

So, the value of h is approximately 2.27.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation 2 = 81 - (15 * x), we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable (15 * x)
To do this, we will subtract 81 from both sides of the equation:

2 - 81 = 81 - 81 - (15 * x)

Step 2: Simplify the equation
-79 = -15 * x

Step 3: Solve for x
To find the value of x, we will divide both sides of the equation by -15:

-79 / -15 = (-15 * x) / -15

Step 4: Simplify the equation
5.266666666666667 = x

So, the value of x that solves the equation is approximately 5.27 (rounded to two decimal places).</pre>

To solve the equation for the value of e, we need to isolate e on one side of the equation.

Step 1: Subtract 88 from both sides of the equation.
177 - 88 = 88 + 6 * e - 88

Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation.
89 = 6 * e

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 6.
89 / 6 = 6 * e / 6

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To determine the unknown variable i in the equation 75 = (58 + 16 * i), we need to isolate i on one side of the equation.

Step 1: Subtract 58 from both sides of the equation.
75 - 58 = (58 + 16 * i) - 58
17 = 16 * i

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 16.
17 / 16 = (16 * i) / 16
17 / 16 = i

The value of the unknown variable i is 17/16.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation for the variable d, we need to isolate d on one side of the equation. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Start with the given equation:
   84 = 20 * d + 21

2. Subtract 21 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the right side:
   84 - 21 = 20 * d + 21 - 21

3. Simplify both sides of the equation:
   63 = 20 * d

4. Divide both sides of the equation by 20 to isolate d:
   63 / 20 = 20 * d / 20

5. Simplify both sides of the equation:
   d = 3.15

So, the value of d is 3.15.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation 61 = (50 + (6 * g)) for g, follow these steps:

Step 1: Subtract 50 from both sides of the equation.
61 - 50 = 50 + (6 * g) - 50

Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation.
11 = 6 * g

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 6.
11 / 6 = (6 * g) / 6

Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation.
11 / 6 = g

So, the value of g is 11/6.</pre>

            Solve the following linear equation for the unknown variable v:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation for the unknown variable v, we will follow these steps:

1. Isolate the term with the variable v on one side of the equation.
2. Simplify the equation.
3. Solve for v.

Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable v on one side of the equation.

126 = ((21 * v) + 76)

Subtract 76 from both sides of the equation:

126 - 76 = ((21 * v) + 76) - 76

50 = 21 * v

Step 2: Simplify the equation.

The equation is already simplified.

Step 3: Solve for v.

To solve for v, divide both sides of the equation by 21:

50 / 21 = (21 * v) / 21

v = 50 / 21

The value of v is approximately 2.381.</pre>

Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable g.
To do this, subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

40 = 91 * g

Step 3: Solve for g by dividing both sides of the equation by 91:

40 / 91 = 91 * g / 91

Step 4: Simplify the equation to find the value of g:

g = 40 / 91

So, g = 40/91.</pre>
