            Carla has a garden and wants to calculate the amount of cucumbers she will be able to grow. She noticed that the number of cucumbers she could grow per plant was determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19. After a few months, she realized that she could grow her production by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17. How many cucumbers is she expecting to grow per plant after adjusting her production method?

Pierre has 19/4 kg of grapes.
He ate 7/25 kg of them, so he has 19/4 - 7/25 = 19/4 - 28/100 = 190/100 - 28/100 = 162/100 = 162/100 kg of grapes left.
His mother gave him 30/9 kg more grapes, so he has 162/100 + 30/9 = 162/100 + 300/900 = 162/100 + 300/900 = 1620/900 + 300/900 = 1920/900 = 192/90 kg of grapes.

            King Arthur is calculating the costs for restoring his castle. The wall repairs cost 26/22 of his castle's annual budget. Meanwhile, the moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget. Finally, installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget. How much (expressed as a fraction of the castle's annual budget) has King Arthur spent on these projects in total?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total cost of the projects is the sum of the costs of the wall repairs, moat renovations, and new defensive catapults.

The wall repairs cost 26/22 of the budget, the moat renovations cost 4/29 of the budget, and the new defensive catapults cost 11/3 of the budget.

To find the total cost, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions and then add them together.

The least common multiple of 22, 29, and 3 is 1743.

So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

The wall repairs cost (26/22) * (1743/1743) = 4566/1743 of the budget.
The moat renovations cost (4/29) * (1743/1743) = 600/1743 of the budget.
The new defensive catapults cost (11/3) * (1743/1743) = 1913/1743 of the budget.

Now, we can add the fractions together:

Total cost = (4566/1743) + (600/1743) + (1913/1743) = 7079/1743 of the budget.

So, King Arthur has spent 7079/1743 of his castle's annual budget on these projects in total.

            A giraffe at the local zoo has a peculiar eating habit. When it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves, it eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day. If the zoo calculates the weekly feeding amount by multiplying the daily intake by itself (making the result &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;) and then multiplying that with the regular daily intake, how many pounds of acacia leaves should they prepare for the giraffe for a week? Calculate ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26))^2 * ((25 / 19) * (30 / 26)) and provide your answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

First, we need to calculate the daily intake of the giraffe when it eats 30/26 times more than usual.

Let's denote the usual daily intake as x. Then, the daily intake when the giraffe eats 30/26 times more is (30/26)x.

Now, we need to calculate the weekly feeding amount squared, which is ((25/19) * (30/26))^2.

Next, we need to multiply the weekly feeding amount squared by the regular daily intake, which is (25/19) * (30/26).

Let's perform the calculations:

1. Calculate the daily intake when the giraffe eats 30/26 times more: (30/26)x
2. Calculate the weekly feeding amount squared: ((25/19) * (30/26))^2
3. Multiply the weekly feeding amount squared by the regular daily intake: ((25/19) * (30/26))^2 * ((25/19) * (30/26))

Calculations:

1. Daily intake when the giraffe eats 30/26 times more: (30/26)x
2. Weekly feeding amount squared: ((25/19) * (30/26))^2 = (1500/4941)^2 = 22500000000/24200900841
3. Multiply the weekly feeding amount squared by the regular daily intake: ((25/19) * (30/26))^2 * ((25/19) * (30/26)) = (22500000000/24200900841) * (1500/4941) = 337500000000000000/11748452456441

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Plane A travels at a speed of 24/11 miles per minute, so in one minute, it travels 24/11 miles.
Plane B travels at a speed of 26/27 miles per minute, so in one minute, it travels 26/27 miles.
The difference in distance traveled by Plane A and Plane B after one minute is 24/11 - 26/27 miles.
To find the difference, we need to find a common denominator for 11 and 27, which is 297.
So, 24/11 = (24 * 27) / (11 * 27) = 648/297 miles
And, 26/27 = (26 * 11) / (27 * 11) = 286/297 miles
The difference in distance traveled by Plane A and Plane B after one minute is 648/297 - 286/297 = 362/297 miles.

To find the total time it takes Toby to play both songs, we need to add the time it takes for each song.
The first song takes 12/8 hours to play and the second song takes 12/3 hours to play.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 3 is 24.
So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 24:

12/3 = 24/24
Now, we can add the fractions:
18/24 + 24/24 = 42/24
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:
42/24 = 7/4

You have 28 out of 29 chocolate bars, which can be represented as 28/29.
You found 8 out of 22 more chocolate bars, which can be represented as 8/22.
To find the total number of chocolate bars you have now, you need to add the two fractions.

To add the fractions, you need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 29 and 22 is 534.
So, you need to convert the fractions to have a denominator of 534.

28/29 can be converted to 28*19/29*19 = 532/534.
8/22 can be converted to 8*24/22*24 = 192/534.

Now, you can add the fractions: 532/534 + 192/534 = 724/534.

To simplify the fraction, divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.
724/534 = 362/267.

So, the fraction that represents the total number of chocolate bars you have now is 362/267.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

To create two identical needles, the maker will need 2 * (27/26) = 54/26 pounds of material.

To create the additional piece, the maker will need 27/6 pounds of material.

To find the total material required, we add the material needed for the needles and the additional piece:

Total material = 54/26 + 27/6

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 26 and 6 is 156. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

54/26 = (54 * 6) / (26 * 6) = 2916/156

27/6 = (27 * 26) / (6 * 26) = 2916/156

Now, we can add the fractions:

Total material = 2916/156 + 2916/156 = 5832/156

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

Total material = (5832/3) / (156/3) = 1944/52

The total material required is 1944/52 pounds.

            Imagine you're a music producer who is working on a new song. Your resources are divided into different sections.

- First, you dedicate 16/4 hours to composing the music and another 16/29 hours to writing the lyrics. This is your initial time investment for the song (let's call it p).

- Then, you spend 28/13 hours for mixing and mastering the song in addition to the initial time investment (let's call this new total time b).

- Suddenly, a drummer you hired for a session uses 18/4 hours less because he finished his parts quickly.

What is the final time you spent on producing the song, if your total time is expressed as (b - (18 / 4))?
        </p>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the final time spent on producing the song, we need to calculate the total time (b) and then subtract the time saved by the drummer.

First, let's find the total time (b) by adding the initial time investment (p) and the time spent on mixing and mastering (28/13 hours):

b = p + 28/13

Now, let's find the initial time investment (p) by adding the time spent on composing the music and writing the lyrics:

p = 16/4 + 16/29

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 29:

p = (16/4 * 29/29) + (16/29 * 29/29)
p = (456/96) + (16/29)

Now, let's add the fractions:

p = (456 + 16) / 96
p = 472 / 96

Now that we have the initial time investment (p), we can find the total time (b):

b = p + 28/13
b = (472 / 96) + 28/13

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 96:

b = (472 / 96) + (28 * 7 / 96)
b = (472 + 196) / 96
b = 668 / 96

Now, let's subtract the time saved by the drummer from the total time (b):

Final time = b - (18 / 4)
Final time = (668 / 96) - (18 * 24 / 96)
Final time = (668 - 432) / 96
Final time = 236 / 96

So, the final time spent on producing the song is 236/96 hours.</pre>

To find out how many colored pencils Marta uses for shading in her art projects over an 11-day period, we need to multiply the number of colored pencils she uses per day for shading by the number of days in the period.
So, the number of colored pencils Marta uses for shading in her art projects over an 11-day period is (20/11) * (23/26).

Evaluating the expression:
(20/11) * (23/26) = 460/286

To find this, you need to add the fraction of colored pencils she uses from the previous problem to the amount of metallic pencils she uses. Evaluate this by performing the operation (8 / 6) + ((20 / 11) * (23 / 26)) and write your answer as a simplified fraction.

Marta uses 8 metallic colored pencils every 6 days, so she uses 8/6 colored pencils per day.
Adding this to the number of colored pencils she uses for shading, we get:
(8/6) + ((20/11) * (23/26))

Evaluating the expression:
(8/6) + ((20/11) * (23/26)) = 40/33 + 230/143

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 33 and 143 is 143*3 = 429.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
40/33 = (40*13)/(33*13) = 520/429
230/143 = (230*3)/(143*3) = 690/429

Now, we can add the fractions:
(520/429) + (690/429) = 1210/429

So, Marta uses 1210/429 colored pencils in total over an 11-day period.

            A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspectâ€™s involvement. Calculate the value of f.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the value of indicator i, we need to find the ratio of the changes in the value of the two specimens.

The first specimen decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units, so the change in value is -26/6.

The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units, so the change in value is -25/17.

To find the ratio of these changes, we divide the change in the second specimen by the change in the first specimen:

i = (-25/17) / (-26/6)

To divide fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction:

i = (-25/17) * (6/26)

i = (-150/442)

To find the value of indicator h, we need to find the difference between the changes in the value of the two specimens.

The first specimen increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units, so the change in value is 18/8.

The second specimen increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units, so the change in value is 17/23.

To find the difference between these changes, we subtract the change in the second specimen from the change in the first specimen:

h = (18/8) - (17/23)

To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 23 is 184, so we rewrite the fractions with this denominator:

h = (18/8) * (23/23) - (17/23) * (8/8)

h = (414/184) - (136/184)

h = (278/184)

To find the value of indicator f, we multiply indicators i and h:

f = (-150/442) * (278/184)

f = (-41910/80384)

The value of indicator f is -41910/80384.</pre>

            In a wildlife park, there are lions and giraffes. During one particular year, the gestation period of a lioness is represented as 20/22 of a year, while a giraffe's gestation period is 15 years. Find the total gestation period of both animals together. 

Later in the same year, a lioness is pregnant again but this time her gestation period reduces by 15/20 of a year compared to the earlier total gestation period of both animals. How long will it take for the lioness to give birth this second time?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
1. To find the total gestation period of both animals together, we need to add the gestation periods of a lioness and a giraffe.
2. To find the gestation period of the lioness in the second pregnancy, we need to subtract 15/20 of the earlier total gestation period from the earlier total gestation period.

Solution:
1. The gestation period of a lioness is 20/22 of a year, which is equal to 20/22 = 0.909 years.
2. The gestation period of a giraffe is 15 years.
3. The total gestation period of both animals together is 0.909 + 15 = 15.909 years.
4. The gestation period of the lioness in the second pregnancy is 15.909 - (15/20 * 15.909) = 15.909 - 11.932 = 3.977 years.

So, the total gestation period of both animals together is 15.909 years, and it will take the lioness 3.977 years to give birth in the second pregnancy.</pre>

The fraction we had after making the first sandwich is ((7/18) + (21/14)).

To subtract (2/4) from this fraction, we need to find a common denominator for (18, 14, and 4). The least common multiple of these numbers is 504.

So, we need to convert (7/18) and (21/14) to fractions with a denominator of 504.

(7/18) = (7 * 28)/(18 * 28) = 196/504

(21/14) = (21 * 36)/(14 * 36) = 756/504

Now, we can subtract (2/4) from ((7/18) + (21/14)).

((196/504) + (756/504)) - (2/4) = (952/504) - (126/504) = 826/504

To find the total amount of juice, we need to add the amounts of apple juice, orange juice, and cranberry juice.

Apple juice: 16/6 liters
Orange juice: 20/12 liters
Cranberry juice: 2/3 liters

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 6, 12, and 3 is 12. So, we rewrite the fractions with the denominator 12:

Apple juice: 16/6 = 24/12 liters
Orange juice: 20/12 liters
Cranberry juice: 2/3 = 8/12 liters

Now, we can add the fractions:

Total juice = (24/12) + (20/12) + (8/12) = 52/12 liters

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

Total juice = (52/4) / (12/4) = 13/3 liters

So, Jan has 13/3 liters of juice in total.

To find the total points earned, we need to multiply the points per level by the number of levels played.

The number of levels played is 13/10, and the points per level is 4/3.

So, the total points earned is (13/10) * (4/3).

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.

(13/10) * (4/3) = (13 * 4) / (10 * 3) = 52 / 30.

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

52 / 2 = 26, and 30 / 2 = 15.

So, the simplified fraction is 26/15.

Therefore, the total points earned is 26/15.

To find the total points earned, we need to multiply the points per level by the number of levels played.

The number of levels played is 13/13, and the points per level is 4/3.

So, the total points earned is (13/13) * (4/3).

Since 13/13 is equal to 1, we can simplify the expression to 1 * (4/3).

1 * (4/3) = 4/3.

Therefore, the total points earned is 4/3.

Jeremy ordered 30/9 ounces of cheese, but he received 17/22 ounces less than he requested. We can use the equation 'd = n - (17 / 22)' to find the amount of cheese he actually received.

In this equation, 'n' represents the amount of cheese Jeremy ordered, and 'd' represents the amount of cheese he actually received.

Substituting the values into the equation, we get:

d = (30/9) - (17/22)

To solve this equation, we need to find a common denominator for 9 and 22, which is 207.

d = (2070/207) - (170/207)

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

d = 2070/207 - 170/207
d = 1900/207

So, Jeremy actually received 1900/207 ounces of cheese.

In the first test, she found that 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays completely, while in the second test, 20 out of every 18 sunglasses also blocked all UV rays.

Sophia decided to add these numbers to her total. Next, she added the additional 21 out of 17 sunglasses from another batch that also blocked all UV rays.

Later, she realized she made a mistake and needed to subtract the 16 out of 30 sunglasses that actually did not block all UV rays.

What is the final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays, according to Sophia's tests and calculations? Please give your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the first test, 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays, so the fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 13/4.
In the second test, 20 out of every 18 sunglasses blocked all UV rays, so the fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 20/18.
In the third batch, 21 out of every 17 sunglasses blocked all UV rays, so the fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 21/17.
In the fourth batch, 16 out of every 30 sunglasses did not block all UV rays, so the fraction of sunglasses that did not block all UV rays is 16/30.
To find the final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays, we need to subtract the fraction of sunglasses that did not block all UV rays from the sum of the fractions of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays.
The sum of the fractions of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is (13/4) + (20/18) + (21/17).
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 18, and 17 is 204.
So, we can rewrite the fractions as (13/4) = (13*51/204), (20/18) = (20*11/204), and (21/17) = (21*12/204).
Now, we can add the fractions: (13*51/204) + (20*11/204) + (21*12/204) = (13*51 + 20*11 + 21*12)/204 = (663 + 220 + 252)/204 = 1135/204.
The fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 1135/204.
To find the final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays, we subtract the fraction of sunglasses that did not block all UV rays from the fraction of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays: (1135/204) - (16/30).
To subtract these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 204 and 30 is 612.
So, we can rewrite the fractions as (1135/204) = (1135*3/612) and (16/30) = (16*20.4/612).
Now, we can subtract the fractions: (1135*3/612) - (16*20.4/612) = (1135*3 - 16*20.4)/612 = (3405 - 326.4)/612 = 3078.6/612.
The final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 3078.6/612.
To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 18.
3078.6/612 = (3078.6/18) / (612/18) = 17.1/34 = 17 1/34.
Therefore, the final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays is 17 1/34.

            Shawn is making sandwiches for a picnic. The recipe for the sandwiches requires different amounts of mayonnaise and sandwich spread. 

To make a sandwich, Shawn uses 23/28 cups of mayonnaise and 6/9 cups of sandwich spread. How many cups of these two ingredients does Shawn use in total to make a sandwich?

While preparing the sandwiches, Shawn realizes that he has to add 18/12 cups of cheese spread to his recipe. Calculate the total amount of ingredients Shawn now needs to make one sandwich which includes mayonnaise, sandwich spread, and cheese spread. 

Finally, if Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, how many cups of ingredients will he use in total to make those sandwiches?
        </p>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

1. To find the total amount of mayonnaise and sandwich spread Shawn uses to make a sandwich, we add the amounts of each ingredient.

2. To find the total amount of ingredients Shawn now needs to make one sandwich, we add the amounts of mayonnaise, sandwich spread, and cheese spread.

3. To find the total amount of ingredients Shawn will use to make an equal number of sandwiches, we multiply the amount of ingredients per sandwich by the number of sandwiches.

Solution:

1. Total amount of mayonnaise and sandwich spread = 23/28 + 6/9
   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 168.
   (23/28) * (6/6) = 138/168
   (6/9) * (18/18) = 12/168
   Total amount = 138/168 + 12/168 = 150/168 = 5/6

2. Total amount of ingredients = 5/6 + 18/12
   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12.
   (5/6) * (2/2) = 10/12
   (18/12) = 18/12
   Total amount = 10/12 + 18/12 = 28/12 = 7/3

3. Total amount of ingredients for an equal number of sandwiches = 4/4 * (7/3)
   Total amount = 4/4 * 7/3 = 28/12 = 7/3

So, Shawn uses 5/6 cups of mayonnaise and sandwich spread to make one sandwich, and he needs 7/3 cups of ingredients to make one sandwich including mayonnaise, sandwich spread, and cheese spread. If he makes an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined, he will use 7/3 cups of ingredients in total.</pre>

The sum of the ratios of the two sections is:

(29 / 23) + (19 / 17)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 23 and 17 is 412. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(29 * 18 / 23 * 18) + (19 * 24 / 17 * 24)

(522 / 412) + (456 / 412)

Now, we can add the fractions:

(522 + 456) / 412 = 978 / 412

The sum of the ratios of the two sections is 978 / 412.

The ratio of a rest, which is equivalent to one whole measure, is 26/26.

Now, we need to subtract the ratio of the rest from the sum of the ratios of the two sections:

(978 / 412) - (26 / 26)

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 412 and 26 is 412. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(978 / 412) - (412 / 412)

(978 - 412) / 412 = 566 / 412

The difference between the sum of the ratios of the two sections and the ratio of the rest is 566 / 412.</pre>

The car travels 21/4 miles every hour.
The car was needed to travel an extra 16/13 miles, but due to a detour, it only traveled an additional 1/21 miles.
To find out how many more miles the car was supposed to travel in total that day, we need to calculate the difference between the additional distance needed and the additional distance traveled.
The additional distance needed is 16/13 miles, and the additional distance traveled is 1/21 miles.
So, the difference is (16/13) - (1/21) = (16/13) * (21/21) - (1/21) * (13/13) = (336/273) - (13/273) = (336 - 13)/273 = 323/273 miles.
To find out how many more miles the car was supposed to travel in total that day, we need to multiply the difference by the average miles the car travels in an hour.
The average miles the car travels in an hour is 21/4 miles.
So, the total additional distance the car was supposed to travel is (323/273) * (21/4) = (323 * 21) / (273 * 4) = 6793 / 1092 miles.
Therefore, the car was supposed to travel 6793 / 1092 miles more in total that day.

            In a book publishing company, the manager has to look after various departments. The editing team takes 20/5 hours to edit a manuscript of a book, while the typesetting team needs 18/17 hours to adjust the layout of a page. 

Some break delay happens that results in a collective loss of 6/15 hours. 

After these delays and losses, the manager, to compensate, extended the working hours by the same amount of time as the initial time span of the process. 

On a particular day, they continue to work. What's the total extended time in hours, if you multiply the time required for the entire process and the extended time after the reduction of the lost hours with the initial total time required?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first find the total time required for the entire process. The editing team takes 20/5 hours to edit a manuscript, and the typesetting team needs 18/17 hours to adjust the layout of a page. So, the total time required for the entire process is:

(20/5) + (18/17) = 4 + 18/17 = 4 + 18/17 = 68/17 + 18/17 = 86/17 hours

Now, let's find the extended time after the reduction of the lost hours. The collective loss is 6/15 hours, and the manager extended the working hours by the same amount of time as the initial time span of the process. So, the extended time is:

(86/17) + (6/15) = (86/17) + (8/17) = 94/17 hours

Finally, let's multiply the time required for the entire process and the extended time after the reduction of the lost hours with the initial total time required:

(86/17) * (94/17) * (86/17) = 7544/289

Jenny plants 13/11 rows of potatoes, and each row yields approximately 21/3 bushels.
So, the total number of bushels she gets is (13/11) * (21/3) = 273/33 bushels.
If each bushel earns her 21/15 dollars, then she will make (273/33) * (21/15) = 3771/495 dollars.
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 105.

First, we need to find the total amount of sugar required for the first and second course.

For the first course, the bread recipe required 11/17 of a cup of sugar.
For the second course, the custard required 6/2 cups of sugar.

So, the total amount of sugar required for the first and second course is:

(11/17) + (6/2) = 11/17 + 3 = 11/17 + 51/17 = 62/17 cups of sugar.

Now, Heather decided to increase the total quantity of sugar by a factor of 29/21.

So, the total amount of sugar used in total is:

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(7 / 8) + (21 / 18) = (7 * 9 / 8 * 9) + (21 * 4 / 18 * 4) = (63 / 72) + (84 / 72)

Now, we can add the fractions:

(63 / 72) + (84 / 72) = (63 + 84) / 72 = 147 / 72

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 147 and 72, which is 9. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by 9:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

First, we need to find the total amount of liquid consumed by the guests (i).

i = (15/7 gallons of water) + (15/24 gallons of wine)

i = 15/7 + 15/24

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 24 is 168.

i = (15/7 * 24/24) + (15/24 * 7/7)

i = (360/168) + (105/168)

i = 465/168

Now, we need to find the total amount of liquid consumed by the guests and the baker's requirement (v).

v = i * (26/20 gallons of milk)

v = (465/168) * (26/20)

v = (465 * 26) / (168 * 20)

v = 11995 / 3360

Now, we need to find the total amount of liquid needed for the feast (x).

x = i + v

x = (465/168) + (11995/3360)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 168 and 3360 is 3360.

x = (465/168 * 20/20) + (11995/3360 * 1/1)

x = (9300/3360) + (11995/3360)

x = 21295/3360

x = 21295/3360

Teddy's favorite number is 30/17.
He adds 18/15 to it, which gives him 30/17 + 18/15 = 90/85.
He then multiplies this new number by 24/13, which gives him 90/85 * 24/13 = 2160/1109.

            Johnny is building a scooter from scratch. He needs to drill holes into the scooter deck to attach the wheels. The size of each hole should be approximately (20/6) cm in diameter. Unfortunately, his drill bit only has a diameter of (11/21) cm. If he uses his current drill bit, he needs to drill a hole, move it over and drill again to achieve the diameter he needs. If he drills each hole exactly once with his drill bit, calculate what fraction of the desired diameter would each hole have? Don't simplify the fraction, keep as (20/6) * (11 / 21).

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

To find the fraction of the desired diameter that each hole would have, we need to divide the diameter of the hole drilled by the drill bit by the desired diameter of the hole.

The diameter of the hole drilled by the drill bit is (11/21) cm. The desired diameter of the hole is (20/6) cm.

So, the fraction of the desired diameter that each hole would have is:

(11/21) / (20/6) = (11/21) * (6/20)

Now, we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately:

Numerator: 11 * 6 = 66
Denominator: 21 * 20 = 420

So, the fraction of the desired diameter that each hole would have is 66/420.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The difference in time between the two models is 17/10 - 12/23 hours.

To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 23 is 230.

So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

17/10 = 34/20
12/23 = 12*10/23*10 = 120/230

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

34/20 - 120/230 = (34*23 - 120*10) / (20*230) = 782/4600

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

782/4600 = 391/2300

So, the second model will take 391/2300 hours less than the first one.

Carlos usually uses 20/15 units of wood to make a chair.
For the special chair, he needs (24/5) times (7/6) units more wood than usual.
To find the total amount of wood needed for the special chair, we need to add the usual amount of wood to the additional amount of wood.

Let's calculate the additional amount of wood first:
(24/5) times (7/6) = (24*7)/(5*6) = 168/30 = 84/15

Now, let's add the usual amount of wood to the additional amount of wood:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The car initially was going at a speed of 13/4 miles per minute.
The car then reduced its speed by 14/15 miles per minute.
The car then increased its speed by 30/15 miles per minute.

To find the final speed of the car, we need to calculate the net change in speed and add it to the initial speed.

The car reduced its speed by 14/15 miles per minute, so the new speed after the reduction is:
(13/4) - (14/15) = (13/4) - (7/10) = (65/40) - (28/40) = (37/40) miles per minute.

The car then increased its speed by 30/15 miles per minute, so the new speed after the increase is:
(37/40) + (30/15) = (37/40) + (4/2) = (37/40) + (80/40) = (117/40) miles per minute.

Therefore, the final speed of the car according to Officer Davis's radar gun is 117/40 miles per minute.

1. The vineyard can usually produce 19/2 baskets of grapes every season. However, due to weather conditions, only 19/29 of the usual amount were produced this season.
   To find out how many baskets of grapes were produced this season, we need to multiply the usual amount by the fraction of the usual amount that was produced.
   So, (19/2) * (19/29) = 361/58 baskets of grapes were produced this season.

2. Jake gets to keep only 7/11 of the total amount of grapes.
   To find out how many baskets of grapes Jake gets, we need to multiply the total amount of grapes by the fraction Jake gets to keep.
   So, (361/58) * (7/11) = 2527/649 baskets of grapes does he get.

3. Out of the grapes that he got, Jake wants to make some grape juice. But he only uses 9/10 of his grapes to make the juice.
   To find out how many baskets of grapes Jake uses for the juice, we need to multiply the amount Jake gets by the fraction he uses for the juice.

The total height of the snowman with the two snowballs is 87/40 feet.
The height of the hat is 14/19 feet.
The total height of the snowman with the two snowballs and the hat is the sum of the heights of the snowballs and the hat, which is 87/40 + 14/19 = 1613/760 + 268/760 = 1881/760 feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The diameter of the larger snowball is 17/6 feet, so its radius is 17/12 feet.
The diameter of the smaller snowball is 1/20 feet, so its radius is 1/40 feet.
The height of a snowball is equal to its diameter, so the height of the larger snowball is 17/6 feet and the height of the smaller snowball is 1/20 feet.
The total height of the snowman is the sum of the heights of the two snowballs, which is 17/6 + 1/20 = 170/60 + 3/60 = 173/60 feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The first child splits up 24/7 parts of the sand, which means each child gets 24/7 parts.
The second child takes away 2/16 part of the sand, which means 2/16 part is taken away from each child.
To find the remaining part of sand in the sandbox, we need to subtract the part taken away from each child from the total part each child initially got.

Calculation:
Remaining part of sand = (24/7) - (2/16)
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 16 is 112.
So, we convert the fractions to have a denominator of 112:
Remaining part of sand = (24*16/7*16) - (2*7/16*7)
Remaining part of sand = (384/112) - (14/112)
Remaining part of sand = 370/112

The remaining part of sand in the sandbox is 370/112.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the expected number of bananas produced by the two species together on a randomly chosen day, we need to calculate the average number of bananas produced by each species per day and then add them together.

For the first species, which produces 12 bananas every 29 days, we can calculate the average number of bananas produced per day by dividing the total number of bananas by the number of days:

(12 bananas) / (29 days) = 0.41379310344827586 bananas per day

For the second species, which produces 30 bananas every 10 days, we can calculate the average number of bananas produced per day by dividing the total number of bananas by the number of days:

(30 bananas) / (10 days) = 3 bananas per day

Now, we can add the average number of bananas produced per day by each species to find the expected number of bananas produced by the two species together on a randomly chosen day:

0.41379310344827586 bananas per day + 3 bananas per day = 3.4137931034482758 bananas per day

So, the expected number of bananas that the two species together will have produced on a randomly chosen day is approximately 3.41 bananas.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To calculate the Zogorian's energy level after the increase, we need to add the initial energy level to the increase in energy.

Initial energy level = (14 / 2) / (23 / 17)
Increase in energy = (16 / 24)

First, let's simplify the initial energy level:
(14 / 2) / (23 / 17) = 7 / (23 / 17)

Now, let's find the reciprocal of the denominator:
7 / (23 / 17) = 7 * (17 / 23) = 119 / 23

Now, let's add the initial energy level and the increase in energy:
(119 / 23) + (16 / 24)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 23 and 24 is 276. So, we need to convert both fractions to have a denominator of 276:

(119 / 23) * (12 / 12) = (1428 / 276)
(16 / 24) * (12 / 12) = (192 / 276)

Now, we can add the fractions:
(1428 / 276) + (192 / 276) = (1620 / 276)

Finally, let's simplify the fraction:
(1620 / 276) = 6

So, the Zogorian's energy level after the increase is 6 zogs.</pre>

The robot starts with 25/10 units of energy and uses 27/23 units of energy. To find out how much energy it has left, we need to subtract the energy used from the initial energy.

25/10 - 27/23 = 25*23/10*23 - 27*10/23*10 = 575/230 - 270/230 = 305/230

The robot has 305/230 units of energy left.

            During rainy weather, a small snail moves at a snail-pace covering 17/21 of a meter in an hour. Another slightly faster snail covers 20/24 of a meter in the same time during such weather. 

One rainy day, the first snail started an hour earlier than the second. At the time when the second snail began, a third snail that covers 18/17 of a meter per hour also started moving. 

What is their total distance in meters 1 hour after all three have started moving? Compute the result using the operation ((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) for the first two snails' distance, and multiply this result by (18 / 17) for the total distance , including the third snail.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

First, we need to find the distance covered by the first two snails in 1 hour.

The first snail covers 17/21 of a meter in an hour, and the second snail covers 20/24 of a meter in an hour.

To find the total distance covered by the first two snails in 1 hour, we add their distances:

(17 / 21) + (20 / 24)

Now, we need to find the distance covered by the third snail in 1 hour.

The third snail covers 18/17 of a meter in an hour.

To find the total distance covered by all three snails in 1 hour, we multiply the sum of the distances covered by the first two snails by the distance covered by the third snail:

((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) * (18 / 17)

Now, let's compute the result:

((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) * (18 / 17) = (0.81 + 0.8333) * 1.06

= 1.6433 * 1.06

= 1.7333

So, their total distance in meters 1 hour after all three have started moving is 1.7333 meters.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total number of kids waiting for the swing, we need to add the number of kids in the first part of the line (2/10 of the total number of kids) and the number of kids in the second part of the line (21/4 kids).

Let's assume the total number of kids in the park is X.

The number of kids in the first part of the line is 2/10 * X = 2X/10 = X/5.

The number of kids in the second part of the line is 21/4.

Now, we can add the number of kids in both parts of the line:

Total number of kids waiting for the swing = (X/5) + 21/4

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 4 is 20. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

Total number of kids waiting for the swing = (4X/20) + (21/4)

Now, we can add the fractions:

Total number of kids waiting for the swing = (4X + 105)/20

So, the total number of kids waiting for the swing is (4X + 105)/20, where X is the total number of kids in the park.</pre>

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
1. First, we need to find out how many glasses were consumed at the party.
2. Then, we will multiply the number of glasses consumed by the amount of beverage in each glass to find the total ounces consumed.
3. Finally, we will add the additional 2/19 ounces consumed to find the total ounces consumed at the party.

Step 1: Calculate the number of glasses consumed.
26/25 of the glasses were consumed, so we need to find out how many glasses were consumed out of the total number of glasses.
Let's assume there were x glasses in total.
(26/25)x = number of glasses consumed

Step 2: Calculate the total ounces consumed.
Each glass contains 29/9 ounces of beverage.
Total ounces consumed = (26/25)x * (29/9)

Step 3: Add the additional 2/19 ounces consumed.
Total ounces consumed = (26/25)x * (29/9) + 2/19

Now, let's solve the problem.

Step 1: Calculate the number of glasses consumed.
(26/25)x = number of glasses consumed

Step 2: Calculate the total ounces consumed.
Total ounces consumed = (26/25)x * (29/9)

Step 3: Add the additional 2/19 ounces consumed.
Total ounces consumed = (26/25)x * (29/9) + 2/19

            You decide to start a toothbrush collection and you add 7/15 of a new set of toothbrushes to your current collection. Suddenly, a friend gifts you 9 more sets. After grouping everything, you realized you can only fit 26/27 of them in your display case. How many sets of toothbrushes can you fit in your display case?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total number of sets of toothbrushes you can fit in your display case is 26/27 of the total number of sets you have.
Let's first find out how many sets of toothbrushes you have in total.
You started with a certain number of sets, then added 7/15 of a new set, and then received 9 more sets.
So, the total number of sets of toothbrushes you have is:
(1 + 7/15 + 9) sets = (18/15 + 7/15 + 9) sets = (25/15 + 9) sets = (16/15 + 9) sets = (16 + 135)/15 sets = 151/15 sets.
Now, we can find out how many sets of toothbrushes you can fit in your display case:
(26/27) * (151/15) sets = (26 * 151) / (27 * 15) sets = 3926 / 375 sets = 11 sets.
So, you can fit 11 sets of toothbrushes in your display case.
The answer is: 11</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The weight of the backpack when it's empty is 27/20 kilograms.
The weight of the book is 1/6 kilograms.
To find the total weight of the backpack, we need to add the weight of the book to the weight of the empty backpack.

Solution:
The total weight of the backpack is (27/20) + (1/6) = 162/120 + 20/120 = 182/120.
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.
So, 182/120 simplifies to 91/60.

The total weight of the backpack is 91/60 kilograms.

            Turtle Tilly is collecting food for the winter. She has gathered 25/9 kg of sea plants, and she then finds 8/13 kg more. In a close-by rock, she spots another food stash weighing 24/27 kg. After gobbling up these finds, Tilly stumbles upon yet another food source weighing 21/26 kg. If Tilly combines all her found food, how many kilograms does she now have in total? Answer as a simplified fraction.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Tilly has gathered 25/9 kg of sea plants, and she then finds 8/13 kg more. So, she has 25/9 + 8/13 kg of sea plants.
In a close-by rock, she spots another food stash weighing 24/27 kg. So, she has 25/9 + 8/13 + 24/27 kg of food.
After gobbling up these finds, Tilly stumbles upon yet another food source weighing 21/26 kg. So, she has 25/9 + 8/13 + 24/27 + 21/26 kg of food.
To find the total amount of food Tilly has, we need to add these fractions together.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 9, 13, 27, and 26 is 2772.

Next, we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 2772:
25/9 = (25 * 308) / 9 * 308 = 7700 / 2772
8/13 = (8 * 212) / 13 * 212 = 1704 / 2772
24/27 = (24 * 102) / 27 * 102 = 2448 / 2772
21/26 = (21 * 103) / 26 * 103 = 2151 / 2772

Now, we can add the fractions together:
7700 / 2772 + 1704 / 2772 + 2448 / 2772 + 2151 / 2772 = 13003 / 2772

Finally, we simplify the fraction:
13003 / 2772 = 13 / 2 = 6.5

So, Tilly now has a total of 6.5 kg of food.</pre>

            Captain Alf undertakes multi-step calculations to ensure the safe navigation of his boat. First, he calculates the difference in his current location and the distance of a nearby island. The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements. 

What does Captain Alfâ€™s final calculation come to? Use these steps and corresponding fractions to find your answer.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Josh rode the scooter for 18 hours on the first day and an additional 1/12 of an hour on the second day.
So, Josh rode the scooter for a total of 18 + 1/12 = 18 + 1/12 = 217/12 hours.
His friend Jack rode the scooter for 7/17 of an hour.
Therefore, they both rode the scooter for a total of 217/12 + 7/17 hours.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 204.
So, 217/12 = (217 * 17) / (12 * 17) = 3709/204 and 7/17 = (7 * 12) / (17 * 12) = 84/204.
Now, we can add the fractions: 3709/204 + 84/204 = 3793/204.
To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.
So, 3793/204 = 3793/204.
Therefore, Josh and Jack rode the scooter for a total of 3793/204 hours.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the fraction of lamps that are floor lamps, desk lamps, table lamps, and decorative lamps, we need to add the fractions representing each type of lamp.

The fraction representing floor lamps is 4/26.
The fraction representing desk lamps is 15/11.
The fraction representing table lamps is 23/28.
The fraction representing decorative lamps is 8/19.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 26, 11, 28, and 19 is 572.

So, we rewrite each fraction with the denominator 572:

Floor lamps: (4/26) * (22/22) = 88/572
Desk lamps: (15/11) * (52/52) = 780/572
Table lamps: (23/28) * (20/20) = 460/572
Decorative lamps: (8/19) * (32/32) = 256/572

Now, we add these fractions:

(88/572) + (780/572) + (460/572) + (256/572) = 1684/572

To simplify this fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

1684/572 = 842/286

So, these lamps constitute 842/286 of the total inventory.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the length of the kite string that Oliver is using now, we first need to find the combined length of the two strings and then multiply it by 5/8.

Step 1: Find the combined length of the two strings.
Combined length = (26/19) + (7/11)

Step 2: Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
The least common multiple of 19 and 11 is 209.

Step 3: Convert the fractions to have the common denominator.
(26/19) = (26 * 11) / (19 * 11) = 286/209
(7/11) = (7 * 19) / (11 * 19) = 133/209

Step 4: Add the two fractions.
Combined length = (286/209) + (133/209) = 419/209

Step 5: Multiply the combined length by 5/8.
Length of the kite string Oliver is using now = (419/209) * (5/8) = 2095/1672

So, the length of the kite string that Oliver is using now is 2095/1672 meters.</pre>

The question is, if 'u' represents the number of snowballs thrown by both Mike and John and 'j' is the total number of snowballs Mike had after finding more, how many snowballs did Mike have in total?

Solve the following equations to find the variable 'j':

u = 9/19 + 6/8

j = u + 4/1

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the value of 'u' by adding the fractions representing the number of snowballs thrown by Mike and John.

u = 9/19 + 6/8

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 19 and 8 is 152. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

u = (9/19 * 8/8) + (6/8 * 19/19)
u = 72/152 + 114/152

Now, we can add the fractions:

u = (72 + 114)/152
u = 186/152

Next, we need to simplify the fraction:

u = 93/76

Now, we can find the value of 'j' using the equation:

j = u + 4/1

j = (93/76) + 4/1

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 76 and 1 is 76. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

j = (93/76 * 1/1) + (4/1 * 76/76)
j = 93/76 + 304/76

Now, we can add the fractions:

j = (93 + 304)/76
j = 397/76

Finally, we can simplify the fraction:

j = 1985/76

So, Mike had 1985/76 snowballs in total after finding more.</pre>

To find the total number of batches of towels Joanna washed, we need to add the number of small towel batches and the number of large towel batches.

Joanna washed 24/20 + 25/15 = 12/10 + 50/15 = 6/5 + 100/30 = 36/30 + 100/30 = 136/30 = 68/15 batches of towels.

            Debra is baking cookies and she realizes she has two different recipes for the same type of cookie. She's wondering if she combines the ingredients from both, if she will end up with even more cookies or not. 

The first recipe requires (27 / 3) cups flour and (11 / 7) cups sugar. She determines the ratio of flour to sugar by dividing the amount of flour by the amount of sugar. She then subtracts (21 / 26) from this ratio because that's how many cups of sugar her friend says makes the cookies too sweet. After that, she adds (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio to see how many total cups of flour she will need. How many cups of flour will she have in the end?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

First, we need to find the ratio of flour to sugar in the first recipe.

The ratio of flour to sugar is (27 / 3) / (11 / 7) = 27 / 3 * 7 / 11 = 189 / 33 = 6.

Next, we subtract (21 / 26) from the ratio.

6 - (21 / 26) = 6 - 0.8076923076923077 = 5.1923076923076925.

Now, we add (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe to the new ratio.

5.1923076923076925 + (22 / 9) = 5.1923076923076925 + 2.4444444444444446 = 7.636752136752137.

So, Debra will have 7.636752136752137 cups of flour in the end.</pre>

The helicopter flew a distance of 24/14 miles for each exercise.
The total distance flown for both exercises is the sum of the distances flown for each exercise.
So, the total distance flown for both exercises is 24/14 + 24/14 = 48/14 miles.
We can represent the total distance flown for both exercises as the product of 'w' times 'w', where 'w' is the distance flown for each exercise.
So, t = w * w = (24/14) * (24/14) = 576/196 = 32/14 miles.
The value of 't' is 32/14 miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The UFO filled 20/16 of its tank during the first refuel, which is equivalent to 5/4 of the tank.
The UFO filled 24/25 of its tank during the second refuel.
To find the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops, we need to add the fractions together.

Solution:
The total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops is (5/4) + (24/25).
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 25 is 100.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator: (5/4) = (125/100) and (24/25) = (96/100).
Now, we can add the fractions: (125/100) + (96/100) = (125 + 96)/100 = 221/100.

The total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops is 221/100.</pre>

To find the sum of the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator and then add the numerators.
The least common multiple of 27 and 26 is 702.
So, we can rewrite the fractions as:
(24 / 27) = (24 * 26) / (27 * 26) = 624 / 702
(30 / 26) = (30 * 27) / (26 * 27) = 810 / 702
Now, we can add the fractions:
(624 / 702) + (810 / 702) = (624 + 810) / 702 = 1434 / 702
So, the sum of the two fractions is 1434 / 702.

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.
1434 / 2 = 717
702 / 2 = 351
So, the simplified fraction is 717 / 351.

To express the fraction as a mixed number, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
717 / 351 = 2 with a remainder of 37.
So, the mixed number is 2 37/351.

Therefore, the sum of the two fractions is 2 37/351.
