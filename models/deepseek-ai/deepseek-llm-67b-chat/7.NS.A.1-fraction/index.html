        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add the fractions (74 / 63) and (91 / 78), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 63 and 78 is 2454. So, we will convert both fractions to have a denominator of 2454.

(74 / 63) = (74 * 39) / (63 * 39) = 2894 / 2454
(91 / 78) = (91 * 31) / (78 * 31) = 2801 / 2454

Now, we can add the fractions:
(2894 / 2454) + (2801 / 2454) = (2894 + 2801) / 2454 = 5695 / 2454

The sum of the fractions is 5695 / 2454.</pre>

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 25 is 25. So, we can rewrite 94/5 as 47/1 and then add the fractions.

94/5 + 1/25 = 47/1 + 1/25 = 47*25/1*25 + 1/25 = 1176/25 + 1/25 = 1177/25

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

(240/40) - (490/40) = -250/40

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:

-250/40 = -25/4

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 49 and 35 is 49*35 = 1715.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
22/49 = (22*35)/(49*35) = 770/1715
72/35 = (72*49)/(35*49) = 3528/1715
Now, we can add the fractions:
(770/1715) + (3528/1715) = (770+3528)/1715 = 4298/1715
To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator:
GCD(4298, 1715) = 17
So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 17:
4298/1715 = (4298/17)/(1715/17) = 254/100
Therefore, the sum of 22/49 and 72/35 is 254/100.
The answer is: 254/100</pre>

First, we need to simplify the fractions.
55/47 = 1 with a remainder of 8, so 55/47 = 1 + 8/47.
72/21 = 3 with a remainder of 9, so 72/21 = 3 + 9/21.
Now, we can rewrite the expression as ((1 + 8/47) + (3 + 9/21)).
Next, we can add the whole numbers and the fractions separately.
The whole numbers are 1 + 3 = 4.
The fractions are 8/47 + 9/21 = (8*3 + 9*2)/47*3 = (24 + 18)/141 = 42/141.
Now, we can rewrite the expression as 4 + 42/141.
Finally, we can simplify the fraction 42/141 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.
42/141 = (42/3) / (141/3) = 14/47.

87/88 = (87 * 13) / (88 * 13) = 1143/1144
24/13 = (24 * 88) / (13 * 88) = 2112/1144

Now, we can add the fractions:

(1143/1144) + (2112/1144) = (1143 + 2112) / 1144 = 3255/1144

So, the sum of 87/88 and 24/13 is 3255/1144.

First, we need to add the fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 33 and 25 is 825. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(68 / 33) + (70 / 25) = (68 * 25) / 825 + (70 * 33) / 825

Now, we can add the fractions:

(68 * 25) / 825 + (70 * 33) / 825 = (1700 + 2310) / 825

Now, we can add the numerators:

(1700 + 2310) / 825 = 3910 / 825

Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

3910 / 825 = (3910 / 5) / (825 / 5) = 782 / 165

So, the answer is 782 / 165.</pre>

To find the sum of the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 97 and 9 is 97. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

35/97 = (35 * 1) / (97 * 1) = 35/97
11/9 = (11 * 10) / (9 * 10) = 110/90

Now, we can add the fractions:

35/97 + 110/90 = (35 * 10) / (97 * 10) + (110 * 1) / (90 * 1) = 350/970 + 110/900

To add the numerators, we add 350 and 110:

350 + 110 = 460

So, the sum of the fractions is:

460/970

Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:

460 / 10 = 46
970 / 10 = 97

So, the simplified sum of the fractions is:

46/97

Therefore, the summation of 35/97 and 11/9 is 46/97.</pre>

15.2 + 4/11 = 15.2 + 0.36363636363636365 (rounded to 15 decimal places).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to divide 83 by 37 and 12 by 14.
83 divided by 37 is 2 with a remainder of 5.
12 divided by 14 is 0 with a remainder of 12.
Now, we can rewrite the expression as (2 + 5/37) - (0 + 12/14).
Simplifying further, we get (2 + 5/37) - (0 + 3/7).
Now, we can subtract the fractions: (2 + 5/37) - (3/7) = 2 - 3/7 + 5/37.
To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 259.
So, we have (2 - 3/7 + 5/37) = (2 * 37/37 - 3/7 * 37/37 + 5/37 * 7/7).
Simplifying further, we get (74/37 - 111/259 + 35/259).
Now, we can combine the fractions: (74/37 - 111/259 + 35/259) = (74/37 - 111/259 + 35/259) = (74/37 + 35/259 - 111/259).
Finally, we can add the fractions: (74/37 + 35/259 - 111/259) = (74/37 - 76/259).
To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 1033.
So, we have (74/37 - 76/259) = (74 * 259/1033 - 76 * 37/1033).
Simplifying further, we get (19186/1033 - 2852/1033).
Finally, we can subtract the fractions: (19186/1033 - 2852/1033) = (16334/1033).
So, the value of the expression is 16334/1033.
The answer is: 16334</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 57 and 80 is 4560.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
95/57 = (95 * 80) / (57 * 80) = 7600/4560
28/80 = (28 * 57) / (80 * 57) = 1596/4560
Now, we can add the fractions:
7600/4560 + 1596/4560 = 9196/4560
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
9196/4560 = (9196/4) / (4560/4) = 2299/1140
So, the sum of 95/57 and 28/80 is 2299/1140.

To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 97 is 1940.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
23/20 = 1940/20 * 23/1940 = 4466/1940
82/97 = 1940/97 * 82/1940 = 1578/1940
Now, we can add the fractions:
23/20 + 82/97 = 4466/1940 + 1578/1940 = 6044/1940
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
6044/1940 = 3022/970
So, the sum of 23/20 and 82/97 is 3022/970.

We already found the sum of 82/15 and 100/12 to be 138/10. Now, we need to add 46/83 to this result.

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 83 is 830. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 830.

138/10 = (138 * 83) / (10 * 83) = 11454/830
46/83 = (46 * 10) / (83 * 10) = 460/830

Now, we can add the fractions:

11454/830 + 460/830 = 11914/830

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

11914/830 = (11914/2) / (830/2) = 5957/415

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 12 is 60. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 60.

61/15 = (61 * 4) / (15 * 4) = 244/60
100/12 = (100 * 5) / (12 * 5) = 500/60

Now, we can add the fractions:

244/60 + 500/60 = 744/60

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6:

744/60 = (744/6) / (60/6) = 124/10

So, the sum of 61/15 and 100/12 is 124/10.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the given expression, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions and then add them.

The common denominator for 25 and 28 is 700.

Now, we need to convert the fractions to have the common denominator of 700.

70/25 = (70 * 28) / (25 * 28) = 1960 / 700

83/28 = (83 * 25) / (28 * 25) = 2075 / 700

Now, we can add the fractions:

1960 / 700 + 2075 / 700 = (1960 + 2075) / 700 = 4035 / 700

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.

4035 / 700 = (4035 / 5) / (700 / 5) = 807 / 140

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 66 and 2 is 66. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

11/66 = 11/66
59/2 = 59*33/2*33 = 1947/66

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

1947/66 - 11/66 = 1936/66

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

1936/66 = 1936/66

So, the answer is 1936/66.</pre>

The given expression is (76/76) + (96/16).
We can simplify this expression by dividing both the numerator and denominator of each fraction by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 76 and 76 is 76, so we can simplify the first fraction as 1/1.
The GCD of 96 and 16 is 16, so we can simplify the second fraction as 6/1.
Now, we can rewrite the expression as 1/1 + 6/1.
Adding the numerators and keeping the denominator the same, we get 7/1.

To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 9 is 63. So, we convert the fractions to have a denominator of 63.

Twenty-nine seventieths is equal to (29/7) * (9/9) = 261/63.
Thirty-three sevenths is equal to (33/7) * (9/9) = 297/63.

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

(297/63) - (261/63) = 36/63.

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9.

36/63 = (36/9) / (63/9) = 4/7.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 69 and 9 is 18.

Next, we need to rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(67 / 9) = (67 * 2) / (9 * 2) = 134 / 18

Now, we can add the fractions:

(237.5 / 172.5) + (134 / 18) = (237.5 * 18) / (172.5 * 18) + (134 * 172.5) / (18 * 172.5) = 4275 / 3127.5 + 22995 / 3127.5 = (4275 + 22995) / 3127.5 = 27270 / 3127.5

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 16 is 16. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 16:

38/8 = 76/16
4/16

Now, we can add the fractions:

76/16 + 4/16 = 80/16

The sum of the fractions is 80/16.

So, 67/15 - 27/12 = (67*4)/60 - (27*5)/60 = 268/60 - 135/60.
Now, we can subtract the fractions: 268/60 - 135/60 = 133/60.
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 13.
So, 133/60 = (133/13) / (60/13) = 10/5 = 2.
Therefore, 67/15 - 27/12 = 2.

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 14 and 20 is 140. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

10/14 = 10*10/14*10 = 100/140
70/20 = 70*7/20*7 = 490/140

Now, we can add the fractions:

100/140 + 490/140 = 590/140

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:

590/140 = 59/14

So, the sum of 10/14 and 70/20 is 59/14.

To convert the fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:

59/14 = 4.214285714285714

So, the sum of 10/14 and 70/20 as a decimal is 4.214285714285714.</pre>

The least common multiple of 44 and 5 is 220.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
19/44 = 475/220

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

First, we need to simplify the fractions.
36 / 37 is already in its simplest form.
8 / 4 can be simplified to 2 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4.
So, the expression becomes (36 / 37) + 2.
To add these two fractions, we need a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 37 and 1 is 1, so we can use that as the common denominator.
(36 / 37) + (2 * 37 / 1) = (36 + 74) / 37 = 110 / 37.
Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.
So, the final result is 110 / 37.

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 75 is 300. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

37/20 = (37*15)/(20*15) = 555/300
16/75 = (16*4)/(75*4) = 64/300

Now, we can add the fractions:

(555/300) + (64/300) = 619/300

The sum of 37/20 and 16/75 is 619/300.

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 300, 80, and 20 is 1200. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

619/300 = (619*4)/(300*4) = 2476/1200
16/75 = (16*16)/(75*16) = 256/1200
61/80 = (61*15)/(80*15) = 915/1200

Now, we can add the fractions:

(2476/1200) + (256/1200) + (915/1200) = 3647/1200

The total when all three fractions are added together is 3647/1200.

To find the sum of 89/84 and 75/34, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple of 84 and 34 is 1812. So, we need to convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1812.

89/84 = (89 * 21) / (84 * 21) = 1871/1812
75/34 = (75 * 53) / (34 * 53) = 3975/1812

Now, we can add the two fractions:

(1871/1812) + (3975/1812) = 5846/1812

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

19/30 + 75/77 = 1463/2310 + 225/2310 = (1463+225)/2310 = 1688/2310

The fraction 1688/2310 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1. So, the simplified fraction is:

1688/2310

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 66 and 64 is 198.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
57/66 = 198/66 * 57/198 = 198/66 * 57/198 = 198*57/66*198 = 198*57/13128
39/64 = 198/64 * 39/198 = 198*39/64*198 = 198*39/12544
Now, we can add the fractions:
198*57/13128 + 198*39/12544 = (198*57 + 198*39)/(13128*12544) = 198*96/13128*12544 = 198*96/16209984 = 198*96/16209984
So, the sum of 57/66 and 39/64 is 198*96/16209984.

To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 60 and 45 is 180. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 180.

24/60 = 24/60 * 3/3 = 72/180
42/45 = 42/45 * 4/4 = 168/180

Now, we can add the fractions:

72/180 + 168/180 = 240/180

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 60.

240/180 = 4/3

So, the sum of 24/60 and 42/45 is 4/3.

We already know the sum of 24/60 and 42/45 is 4/3. Now, we need to add this to 66/12.

To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 12 is 12. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 12.

4/3 = 4/3 * 4/4 = 16/12
66/12 = 66/12

Now, we can add the fractions:

16/12 + 66/12 = 82/12

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

82/12 = 41/6

42/67 = 42/67 * 33/33 = 1386/2220

Now, we can add the fractions:

888/2220 + 1386/2220 = 2274/2220

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the expression 79/32 - 52/55, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 32 and 55 is 1760, so we can rewrite the expression as follows:

(79/32) * (55/55) - (52/55) * (32/32)

Now, we can simplify the expression:

(79 * 55) / (32 * 55) - (52 * 32) / (55 * 32)

4345 / 1760 - 1664 / 1760

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

(4345 - 1664) / 1760

2681 / 1760

Finally, we can simplify the fraction:

2681 / 1760 = 1.5217391304347828

So, the value of the expression 79/32 - 52/55 is approximately 1.5217.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The usual length of a piece of wood is 45/2 feet.
The piece they sold is 18/90 feet shorter than the usual length.
To find the length of the piece they sold, we subtract 18/90 from 45/2.

45/2 - 18/90 = (90*45 - 18*2) / (2*90) = (4050 - 36) / 180 = 4014 / 180 = 22.35 feet

The piece they sold is 22.35 feet long.

            What is the sum of 99/92 and 15/74 as a simplified fraction?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 92 and 74 is 6984.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
99/92 = 7188/6984
15/74 = 1071/6984
Now, we can add the fractions:
7188/6984 + 1071/6984 = 8259/6984
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9:
8259/6984 = 918/710
So, the sum of 99/92 and 15/74 as a simplified fraction is 918/710.

First, we need to add the fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1 and 30 is 30. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

54/1 = 54*30/30 = 1620/30
62/30

Now, we can add the fractions:

(1620/30) + (62/30) = 1682/30

Next, we simplify the fraction:

1682/30 = 841/15

So, the result of 54/1 + 62/30 is 841/15.</pre>
