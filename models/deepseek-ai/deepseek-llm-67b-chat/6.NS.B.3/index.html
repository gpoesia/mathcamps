            A window cleaning company charges $533.89 for cleaning the windows of a large building, and this cost is equally shared by 20.3 tenants. How much does each tenant contribute to the window cleaning cost?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how much each tenant contributes, we need to divide the total cost by the number of tenants.

Total cost = $533.89
Number of tenants = 20.3

Contribution per tenant = Total cost / Number of tenants
Contribution per tenant = $533.89 / 20.3

Calculating the result:
Contribution per tenant = $26.30

Each tenant contributes $26.30 to the window cleaning cost.

            Previously, the window cleaning cost was divided among the tenants based on a total expense of $533.89. However, it turns out there was a mistake in the billing and the cleaning company only charged $21 for the job. With this adjusted cost, how much would each of the 20.3 tenants need to contribute to the window cleaning cost now?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how much each tenant contributes now, we need to divide the adjusted total cost by the number of tenants.

Adjusted total cost = $21
Number of tenants = 20.3

Contribution per tenant = Adjusted total cost / Number of tenants
Contribution per tenant = $21 / 20.3

Calculating the result:
Contribution per tenant = $1.03

Each tenant now needs to contribute $1.03 to the window cleaning cost.

To find out how many kilograms of cucumber each store received, we need to divide the total amount of cucumber (2218.5 kg) by the number of grocery stores (51).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many kilograms of cucumber were left at each store after making the salad, we need to subtract the amount of cucumber used for the salad (25.3 kg) from the amount each store received (43.5 kg).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total amount of carbon dioxide that can be absorbed by the oak trees in the forest, we need to multiply the number of hectares by the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed per hectare.

Number of hectares = 70.3
Amount of carbon dioxide absorbed per hectare = 88.8 tons

Total amount of carbon dioxide absorbed = Number of hectares * Amount of carbon dioxide absorbed per hectare
Total amount of carbon dioxide absorbed = 70.3 * 88.8

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many gallons of water each tank will contain, we need to divide the total amount of water in the well by the number of tanks.

Total amount of water in the well = 4723.97 gallons
Number of tanks = 89.3

Amount of water per tank = Total amount of water / Number of tanks
Amount of water per tank = 4723.97 / 89.3

Calculating the result:
Amount of water per tank = 52.99 gallons

Each tank will contain 52.99 gallons of water.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the volume of each snowball, we need to divide the total volume of snow by the number of snowballs.

Volume of snow / Number of snowballs = Volume of each snowball

3442.04 cubic inches / 64.7 snowballs = Volume of each snowball

Calculating the result:

3442.04 / 64.7 = 53.2 cubic inches

So, each snowball has 53.2 cubic inches of snow.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the volume of each new larger snowball, we need to divide the total volume of snow by the number of new larger snowballs.

Volume of snow / Number of new larger snowballs = Volume of each new larger snowball

3442.04 cubic inches - (7.8 * 53.2 cubic inches) = Volume of snow in new larger snowballs

Calculating the result:

3442.04 - (7.8 * 53.2) = 2800.8 cubic inches

Now, we need to find the number of new larger snowballs:

64.7 - 7.8 = 56.9 new larger snowballs

Finally, we can find the volume of each new larger snowball:

2800.8 cubic inches / 56.9 new larger snowballs = Volume of each new larger snowball

Calculating the result:

2800.8 / 56.9 = 49.3 cubic inches

So, each new larger snowball has 49.3 cubic inches of snow.

The rainfall increased by 7.97 inches per day for 52.7 days.
To find the total inches of rain that fell during that time, we need to multiply the increase per day by the number of days.

Calculation:
Total inches of rain = Increase per day * Number of days
Total inches of rain = 7.97 inches/day * 52.7 days
Total inches of rain = 417.239 inches

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many ounces of hot chocolate was served to friends, we need to subtract the amount left from the original amount.

Original amount = 75.06 ounces
Amount left = 46.86 ounces

Amount served = Original amount - Amount left
Amount served = 75.06 - 46.86
Amount served = 28.2 ounces

So, 28.2 ounces of hot chocolate was served to friends.

To find out how many ounces of hot chocolate the family made this time, we need to multiply the amount served by 74.0.

Amount served = 28.2 ounces
Amount made this time = Amount served * 74.0
Amount made this time = 28.2 * 74.0
Amount made this time = 2086.8 ounces

To find the weight of the remaining components, we subtract the weight of the toothpaste tube from the total weight of the promotional pack.

Weight of remaining components = Total weight of promotional pack - Weight of toothpaste tube

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many pounds of tomatoes will be in each box, we need to divide the total weight of tomatoes by the number of boxes.

Total weight of tomatoes = 441.84 pounds
Number of boxes = 67

Weight of tomatoes in each box = Total weight of tomatoes / Number of boxes
Weight of tomatoes in each box = 441.84 / 67

Weight of tomatoes in each box = 6.6 pounds

So, there will be 6.6 pounds of tomatoes in each box.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The cost of one part is $79.61.
There are 6.24 identical parts in each camera.
To find the total cost of the parts for one camera, we need to multiply the cost of one part by the number of parts.

Calculation:
Total cost of the parts for one camera = $79.61 * 6.24

Using a calculator, we get:
Total cost of the parts for one camera = $494.99

The snowball traveled a total of 50.23 meters before hitting the ground. It first had to travel past a tree that was 24.6 meters away. To find out how much distance the snowball covered past the tree, we need to subtract the distance to the tree from the total distance.

Solution:
Total distance = 50.23 meters
Distance to the tree = 24.6 meters
Distance past the tree = Total distance - Distance to the tree
Distance past the tree = 50.23 - 24.6 = 25.63 meters

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many pounds of fish each store will receive, we need to divide the total weight of fish by the number of stores.

First, we need to convert the number of stores to a whole number. Since we can't have a fraction of a store, we'll round 18.2 down to 18.

Now, we'll divide the total weight of fish (1303.12 pounds) by the number of stores (18):

1303.12 ï¿½ 18 = 72.39444444444444

Since we can't have a fraction of a pound of fish, we'll round the result to the nearest whole number.

Each store will receive approximately 72 pounds of fish.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total amount of fuel consumed, we need to multiply the fuel consumption per trip by the number of trips.

Fuel consumption per trip = 18.5 liters
Number of trips = 62.38

Total fuel consumption = Fuel consumption per trip * Number of trips
Total fuel consumption = 18.5 * 62.38

Calculating the total fuel consumption:
Total fuel consumption = 1155.27 liters

To find the height of the model, we need to multiply the height of the original castle (in meters) by the scale factor (in mm/meter).

Scale factor = 27.69 mm/meter
Height of original castle = 68.4 meters

Height of model = Scale factor * Height of original castle
Height of model = 27.69 mm/meter * 68.4 meters

Height of model = 1899.156 mm

The model of the castle will be 1899.156 mm tall.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the weight of each tent, we need to divide the total weight of the fleet by the number of tents.

Weight of each tent = Total weight of the fleet / Number of tents

Weight of each tent = 1448.37 pounds / 69.3 tents

Weight of each tent = 20.87 pounds

Therefore, each tent weighs approximately 20.87 pounds.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total volume of the bubbles, we need to multiply the volume of one bubble by the number of bubbles.

Volume of one bubble = 55.9 cubic centimeters
Number of bubbles = 77.8

Total volume of the bubbles = Volume of one bubble * Number of bubbles
Total volume of the bubbles = 55.9 * 77.8

Calculating the total volume:
Total volume of the bubbles = 4347.82 cubic centimeters
