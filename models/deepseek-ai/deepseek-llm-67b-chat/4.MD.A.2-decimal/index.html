    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Maria drove at an average speed of 11.0 miles per hour for 6.7 hours, so she covered a distance of 11.0 * 6.7 = &lt;&lt;11*6.7=73.7&gt;&gt;73.7 miles.
After that, she continued for another 4.3 miles, so the total distance she covered is 73.7 + 4.3 = &lt;&lt;73.7+4.3=78&gt;&gt;78 miles.

        A car travels a distance of 775.644 miles on 43.6 gallons of fuel. How many miles does the car travel per gallon of fuel?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the miles per gallon, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the total gallons of fuel used.

Total distance traveled = 775.644 miles
Total gallons of fuel used = 43.6 gallons

Miles per gallon = Total distance traveled / Total gallons of fuel used
Miles per gallon = 775.644 / 43.6

Calculating the result:
Miles per gallon = 17.8

The car travels 17.8 miles per gallon of fuel.</pre>

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The original garden is 3 meters wide.
Eva extends the garden by 22.6 meters, so the new length is 3 + 22.6 = 25.6 meters.
The new garden is as long as the width of the original garden times the total length after the extension, so the new width is 25.6/3 = 8.53 meters.
The total area of Eva's garden is the product of the length and width, so it is 25.6 * 8.53 = 218.208 square meters.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many miles the vehicle travels per gallon of gas, we need to divide the total miles traveled by the number of gallons of gas used.

The vehicle travels 367.8 miles on a full tank of gas that holds 15 gallons.

So, the vehicle travels 367.8/15 = &lt;&lt;367.8/15=24.52&gt;&gt;24.52 miles per gallon of gas.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the resulting number after squaring the number of miles the vehicle travels per gallon of gas, we need to square the value we found in the previous question.

The vehicle travels 24.52 miles per gallon of gas.

So, the resulting number after squaring the number of miles it can travel per gallon is 24.52^2 = &lt;&lt;24.52^2=596.2404&gt;&gt;596.2404.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many miles the vehicle would travel per gallon of gas with a 20-gallon tank, we need to divide the total miles traveled by the new number of gallons of gas used.

The vehicle travels 367.8 miles on a full tank of gas that now holds 20 gallons.

So, the vehicle would travel 367.8/20 = &lt;&lt;367.8/20=18.39&gt;&gt;18.39 miles per gallon of gas.

        Samuel has a total of 176 liters of paint. He wants to distribute it evenly into 8 barrels. How many liters of paint will there be in each barrel?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many liters of paint will be in each barrel, we need to divide the total amount of paint by the number of barrels.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many liters of paint Samuel will need in total, we need to multiply the number of barrels by the amount of paint in each barrel.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many liters of paint will be in each barrel, we need to divide the total amount of paint by the number of barrels.

        If a car consumes 615 liters of gas every 41 hours, how many liters of gas will it consume in 30 hours?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The car consumes 615 liters of gas every 41 hours.
To find out how many liters of gas it will consume in 30 hours, we can set up a proportion.
Let x be the number of liters of gas the car will consume in 30 hours.
We can set up the proportion: 615 liters / 41 hours = x liters / 30 hours
Cross-multiplying, we get: 615 * 30 = 41 * x
Simplifying, we get: 18450 = 41x
Dividing both sides by 41, we get: x = 450
Therefore, the car will consume 450 liters of gas in 30 hours.

To find the amount for each monthly installment, we divide the total amount by the number of installments: $303.5756 / 19.51 = $15.57.
The amount for car insurance is $41.35.
To find the total monthly payment for the car and insurance, we add the amount for each monthly installment and the amount for car insurance: $15.57 + $41.35 = $56.92.

If the cyclist repeats this cycle for 7 days, we multiply the distance covered after the break each day by the number of days.

11.6 * 7 = 81.2

The cyclist covers 81.2 kilometers after resuming from the break over these 7 days.

        Based on the previous problem, now assume that on each of these 7 days, the cyclist pedals for 50.0 kilometers total, but now takes a break after covering 40 kilometers. How much distance, in kilometers, does the cyclist cover after resuming from the break each day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The cyclist pedals for 50.0 kilometers in total each day.
Before stopping for a break, the cyclist covers 40 kilometers.
To find out how far the cyclist pedaled after resuming from the break each day, we subtract the distance covered before the break from the total distance.

50.0 - 40.0 = 10.0

The cyclist covers 10.0 kilometers after resuming from the break each day.

        A delivery driver travels 67.66 miles in 17 hours. How far does he drive in one hour?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how far the delivery driver drives in one hour, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is 67.66 miles and the total time taken is 17 hours.

So, the distance traveled in one hour is 67.66 miles / 17 hours = 3.98 miles.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

Bob drives for 3.9 hours at a speed of 8.0 miles per hour, so he drives 31.2 miles (8.0 miles/hour × 3.9 hours).

During his break, his car cools down by 21 miles of equivalent energy consumption.

To find the equivalent distance for the energy remaining in his car, we need to subtract the energy consumed during the break from the total distance driven.

Equivalent distance = Total distance - Energy consumed during break

Equivalent distance = 31.2 miles - 21 miles

Equivalent distance = 10.2 miles

The equivalent distance for the energy remaining in Bob's car is 10.2 miles.
