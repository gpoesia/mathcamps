To find out how many bundles of carrots Farmer Bob will have, we need to divide the total number of carrots by the number of carrots in each bundle.

Total number of carrots = 71820
Number of carrots in each bundle = 684

Number of bundles = Total number of carrots / Number of carrots in each bundle
Number of bundles = 71820 / 684

To find out how many bundles of carrots Farmer Bob will have, we need to divide the total number of carrots by the number of carrots in each bundle.

Total number of carrots = 71820

Number of bundles = Total number of carrots / Number of carrots in each bundle
Number of bundles = 71820 / 2486

Calculating the division:

Since Farmer Bob cannot have a fraction of a bundle, we need to round the result to the nearest whole number.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the average number of lions saved per day, we need to divide the total number of lions saved by the number of days.

Total number of lions saved = 96187
Number of days = 6279

Average number of lions saved per day = Total number of lions saved / Number of days
= 96187 / 6279
= 15.27 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, on average, 15.27 lions were saved per day.

To find out how much light energy the star emits every hour, we need to divide the total amount of light energy by the total number of hours.

Solution:
The star emits 94548 units of light energy over 3349 hours.
So, the star emits 94548/3349 = &lt;&lt;94548/3349=28&gt;&gt;28 units of light energy every hour.

New average potatoes per plant = 7664 / 2692

New average potatoes per plant = 2.84 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, with the new total of potatoes, each plant produces an average of 2.84 potatoes.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the area of each section, we need to divide the total area of the park by the number of sections.
Area of each section = Total area of the park / Number of sections
Area of each section = 57546 / 131
Area of each section = 439
The area of each section is 439 square meters.

To find out how many toothpaste tubes are generated from one box of raw materials, we need to divide the total number of toothpaste tubes produced by the number of boxes of raw materials used.

Let's calculate:
Number of toothpaste tubes generated from one box of raw materials = Total number of toothpaste tubes produced / Number of boxes of raw materials used
Number of toothpaste tubes generated from one box of raw materials = 93822 / 4938

Calculating the division:
Number of toothpaste tubes generated from one box of raw materials = 19

To find out how many messages the alien civilization sends per day, we need to divide the total number of messages by the total number of days.

Total number of messages = 43134
Total number of days = 3318

Number of messages per day = Total number of messages / Total number of days
Number of messages per day = 43134 / 3318

Calculating the division:
Number of messages per day = 13

The alien civilization sends 13 messages per day.</pre>

To find out how many students are there per bus, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of school buses.

Total number of students = 80,011
Number of school buses = 31

Number of students per bus = Total number of students / Number of school buses
Number of students per bus = 80,011 / 31

Calculating the result:
Number of students per bus = 2,548.74193548387

Since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we need to round the result to the nearest whole number.

Number of students per bus = 2,549

To find out how many pens were produced every hour, we need to divide the total number of pens produced by the total number of hours.

Number of pens produced every hour = Total number of pens produced / Total number of hours

We can set up a proportion to solve this problem.
Let x be the number of centimeters on the map that represent 1 kilometer in real life.
We can set up the proportion: 91368 centimeters / 216 kilometers = x centimeters / 1 kilometer
Cross-multiplying, we get: 91368 centimeters * 1 kilometer = 216 kilometers * x centimeters
Simplifying, we get: 91368 = 216x
Dividing both sides by 216, we get: x = 91368 / 216
Calculating, we get: x = 423.52381
Therefore, 424 centimeters on the map represent 1 kilometer in real life.

Each player has 17394/7489 = &lt;&lt;17394/7489=2.3176&gt;&gt;2.3176 points.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total number of acres in the park is 3276.
The number of sections is 126.
To find the number of acres in each section, we divide the total number of acres by the number of sections.
3276 acres / 126 sections = 26 acres per section.
The answer is: 26</pre>
