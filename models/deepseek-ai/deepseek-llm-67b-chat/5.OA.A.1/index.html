            A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The company has 2840 socks to package, and they package them in sets of 40. So, they will need 2840/40 = &lt;&lt;2840/40=71&gt;&gt;71 packs to package all the socks.
They already have 93 packs, so they will have a total of 93+71 = &lt;&lt;93+71=164&gt;&gt;164 packs once all the socks have been packaged.
After receiving an additional 70 packs, the total number of packs will be 164+70 = &lt;&lt;164+70=234&gt;&gt;234 packs.
However, they had to return 8 packs due to quality issues, so the final number of packs will be 234-8 = &lt;&lt;234-8=226&gt;&gt;226 packs.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The manufacturer produces 46 blankets each day for 43 days, so the total number of blankets produced is 46*43 = &lt;&lt;46*43=1918&gt;&gt;1918 blankets.
After 43 days, the manufacturer received an additional 42 blankets, so the total number of blankets is now 1918+42 = &lt;&lt;1918+42=1960&gt;&gt;1960 blankets.

            A particular star emits light at a velocity of 1095 miles per second. If this velocity were divided by 73, what would be the resulting speed of the light emitted by the star?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The problem asks for the speed of light emitted by the star if the current velocity is divided by 73.

Solution:
To find the resulting speed of the light emitted by the star, we need to divide the current velocity by 73.

The current velocity of the light emitted by the star is 1095 miles per second.

So, the resulting speed of the light emitted by the star would be 1095/73 miles per second.

1095/73 = 15 miles per second.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to find out how many treasures each gnome gets initially.
The dragon has 1702 treasures and he wants to divide them among 37 gnomes.
So, each gnome gets 1702/37 = &lt;&lt;1702/37=45.972&gt;&gt;45.972 treasures initially.

Next, the dragon decides to add another 49 treasures to each gnome.
So, each gnome now has 45.972 + 49 = &lt;&lt;45.972+49=94.972&gt;&gt;94.972 treasures.

Since we can't have a fraction of a treasure, we need to round the number of treasures each gnome has to the nearest whole number.
Rounding 94.972, we get 95 treasures.

So, each gnome now has 95 treasures.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The battery life decreases by 36/9 = &lt;&lt;36/9=4&gt;&gt;4 hours when the car's lights are used.
The toy car is run with the lights on for 12 weeks, each week considered to be 60 hours, so the total time the car is run with the lights on is 12 * 60 = &lt;&lt;12*60=720&gt;&gt;720 hours.
The battery life decreases by 4 hours for each hour the car's lights are used, so the total decrease in battery life is 720 * 4 = &lt;&lt;720*4=2880&gt;&gt;2880 hours.
The original battery life is 16 hours, so the battery life with the lights on is 16 - 2880 = &lt;&lt;16-2880=-2864&gt;&gt;-2864 hours.
The battery life with the lights on is negative, which means the battery would have died before the car was run for 12 weeks.

To find out how much each installment would be, we need to divide the total cost of the wallet by the number of installments.

            A train travels at a speed of 68 mph but due to certain restrictions, it had to slow down to 28 mph. Considering the travel time of 21 hours, calculate the impact on the total distance traveled by the train.
        </p>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the time the train traveled at 68 mph as t1 and the time it traveled at 28 mph as t2. We know that t1 + t2 = 21 hours.

Let's denote the distance traveled at 68 mph as d1 and the distance traveled at 28 mph as d2. We know that d1 = 68 * t1 and d2 = 28 * t2.

The total distance traveled is d1 + d2.

We can use the equation t1 + t2 = 21 to find the value of t1 and t2.

t1 = 21 - t2

Substituting this into the equation for d1, we get:

d1 = 68 * (21 - t2)

Now, we can substitute this into the equation for the total distance:

Total distance = d1 + d2 = 68 * (21 - t2) + 28 * t2

We want to find the impact on the total distance, so we need to find the difference between the total distance when the train travels at 68 mph for the entire 21 hours and the total distance when it slows down to 28 mph for some time.

Total distance when traveling at 68 mph for 21 hours = 68 * 21

Total distance when slowing down to 28 mph for some time = 68 * (21 - t2) + 28 * t2

Impact on the total distance = Total distance when traveling at 68 mph for 21 hours - Total distance when slowing down to 28 mph for some time

Impact on the total distance = 68 * 21 - (68 * (21 - t2) + 28 * t2)

Impact on the total distance = 1428 - (68 * 21 - 68 * t2 + 28 * t2)

Impact on the total distance = 1428 - (1428 - 40 * t2)

Impact on the total distance = 40 * t2

Since t1 + t2 = 21, we know that t2 = 21 - t1. We can substitute this into the equation for the impact on the total distance:

Impact on the total distance = 40 * (21 - t1)

Now, we can find the maximum impact on the total distance by maximizing t1. Since t1 + t2 = 21, the maximum value of t1 is 21, which occurs when t2 = 0.

Impact on the total distance = 40 * (21 - 21) = 0

So, the impact on the total distance is 0.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The construction company can build 1425 square feet of a house in 19 days.
To find out how many square feet they would have built in 14 days, we can set up a proportion.
1425 square feet is to 19 days as x square feet is to 14 days.
We can set up the proportion as follows:
1425/19 = x/14
To solve for x, we can cross multiply:
1425 * 14 = 19 * x
20050 = 19x
Dividing both sides by 19, we get:
x = 20050/19
x = 1055.26
Since the number of square feet cannot be a decimal, we can round it to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, the construction company would have built approximately 1055 square feet in 14 days.

To find out how many increments of 69 points are needed to reach 3795 points, we can divide 3795 by 69.
3795 ï¿½ 69 = 54.941
Since the number of increments must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, the player needs 55 increments to gain the points required to complete the level.
