The bus drives 2496 miles over 52 weeks.
To find the average miles driven per week, we divide the total miles by the number of weeks.

The astronaut uses 3870 liters of oxygen in 90 days.
To find out how much oxygen he uses daily, we need to divide the total amount of oxygen by the number of days.

To find out how many lamps the factory manufactures daily, we need to divide the total number of lamps produced by the number of days.

Solution:
The factory manufactures 7668/37 = &lt;&lt;7668/37=207.243&gt;&gt;207.243 lamps daily.

Since we can't have a fraction of a lamp, we can round the number to the nearest whole number.

The total weight of tomatoes harvested is 2065 kilograms.
The number of tomato plants is 59.
To find the average weight of tomatoes produced by each plant, we divide the total weight by the number of plants.
Average weight of tomatoes per plant = Total weight of tomatoes / Number of plants
Average weight of tomatoes per plant = 2065 / 59
Average weight of tomatoes per plant = 35 kilograms
Therefore, on average, each tomato plant produced 35 kilograms of tomatoes.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total number of cookies is still 2460, but now they are divided into 554 batches instead of 60.
To find out how many cookies are in each batch, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of batches.
So, 2460 cookies / 554 batches = 4.43 cookies per batch.
Since we can't have a fraction of a cookie, we round down to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, there are 4 cookies in each batch.

To find out how many bottles are filled per hour under the new target, we need to divide the total number of bottles by the total number of hours.

Number of bottles filled per hour = Total number of bottles / Total number of hours

Number of bottles filled per hour = 8607 / 88

Number of bottles filled per hour = 98

So, under the new target, the beverage company fills 98 bottles per hour.

To find the average speed of the plane, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken.
The total distance traveled by the plane is 1720 miles.
The total time taken by the plane is 86 hours.
So, the average speed of the plane is 1720 miles / 86 hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The boat consumes 204 liters of fuel during a journey of 51 hours.
To find out how many liters of fuel the boat consumes in one hour, we need to divide the total fuel consumption by the total number of hours.

Solution:
The boat consumes 204 liters of fuel in 51 hours.
So, the boat consumes 204/51 = &lt;&lt;204/51=4&gt;&gt;4 liters of fuel in one hour.

The factory operates for 4 days a week, so the total number of toys made in a week is divided by 4 to find the number of toys made per day.
571 toys / 4 days = &lt;&lt;571/4=142.75&gt;&gt;142.75 toys per day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the length of each piece of rope, we need to divide the total length of the rope by the number of pieces.

The total length of the rope is 4230 meters, and it is divided into 90 pieces.

So, the length of each piece of rope is 4230/90 = &lt;&lt;4230/90=47&gt;&gt;47 meters.

To find the number of trees per hectare, we need to divide the total number of trees by the total number of hectares.

Number of trees per hectare = Total number of trees / Total number of hectares

Number of trees per hectare = 2508 trees / 38 hectares

Number of trees per hectare = 66 trees

Therefore, there are 66 trees per hectare in the forest.

The number of boxes needed is 910/538 = &lt;&lt;910/538=1.69&gt;&gt;1.69 boxes.
Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many gifts each shelter received, we need to divide the total number of gifts by the number of shelters.

Total number of gifts = 741
Number of shelters = 13

Number of gifts per shelter = Total number of gifts / Number of shelters
Number of gifts per shelter = 741 / 13

Calculating the result:
Number of gifts per shelter = 57

Each shelter received 57 gifts.</pre>
