        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Steve spent 38/8 = &lt;&lt;38/8=4.75&gt;&gt;4.75 dollars per day.
Steve spent 4.75*8 = &lt;&lt;4.75*8=38&gt;&gt;38 dollars in total.
Steve had 38+11 = &lt;&lt;38+11=49&gt;&gt;49 dollars after receiving the extra money.
John spent 38 dollars.
John had 18-38 = &lt;&lt;18-38=-20&gt;&gt;-20 dollars after spending the money.
John found 25 dollars on the street, so he had -20+25 = &lt;&lt;-20+25=5&gt;&gt;5 dollars.

            Sally wants to measure the distance of her bike route. Initially, she hesitates and travels only 47/50 of a mile. Then, she gains confidence and rides another 31 miles. Every day for the next 28 days, she completes the same distance.

One day, she decided to detour and added an extra 32/24 miles to her regular bike route. How many miles in total did she travel after adding the extra traveling distance?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Sally initially traveled 47/50 of a mile, which is equivalent to 0.94 miles.
She then rode 31 miles, bringing her total distance to 0.94 + 31 = 31.94 miles.
She repeated this distance for 28 days, so her total distance after 28 days is 31.94 * 28 = 894.32 miles.
She then added an extra 32/24 miles, which is equivalent to 1.33 miles.
Therefore, her total distance after adding the extra distance is 894.32 + 1.33 = 895.65 miles.
The answer is: 895.65</pre>

1. The truck can travel 34/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel.
2. If 11 more kilometers are added to its journey, the truck can travel 34/25 + 11 kilometers on a liter of fuel.
3. If an additional 49 kilometers are added to the journey, the truck can travel 34/25 + 11 + 49 kilometers on a liter of fuel.

Calculations:
1. The truck can travel 34/25 + 11 = 179/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel.
2. The truck can travel 179/25 + 49 = 308/25 = 12.32 kilometers on a liter of fuel.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Jack earned 41/48 of a dollar from recycling cans, which is equal to 41/48 * 1 = &lt;&lt;41/48*1=0.8541666666666666&gt;&gt;0.8541666666666666 dollars.
He then found a quarter, which is equal to 23/24 * 1 = &lt;&lt;23/24*1=0.9583333333333333&gt;&gt;0.9583333333333333 dollars.
So, Jack earned a total of 0.8541666666666666 + 0.9583333333333333 = &lt;&lt;0.8541666666666666+0.9583333333333333=1.8125&gt;&gt;1.8125 dollars.
Adding this to his initial 38 dollars, Jack now has 38 + 1.8125 = &lt;&lt;38+1.8125=39.8125&gt;&gt;39.8125 dollars.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total amount of paint distributed to all the students, we need to multiply the amount of paint each student received by the number of students.

The amount of paint each student received is 16/31 litres.
The number of students is 32.

So, the total amount of paint distributed is (16/31) * 32.

Calculating the answer:
(16/31) * 32 = 16 * 32 / 31 = 512 / 31 = 16.55 litres (rounded to two decimal places).

Therefore, the total amount of paint distributed to all the students is 16.55 litres.

John consumes 17/8 = &lt;&lt;17/8=2.125&gt;&gt;2.125 pounds of apples per day.
John consumes 48/42 = &lt;&lt;48/42=1.1428571428571428&gt;&gt;1.1428571428571428 ounces of apple juice per day.
To find the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption, we need to convert pounds to ounces.
There are 16 ounces in a pound, so 17 pounds is equal to 17*16 = &lt;&lt;17*16=272&gt;&gt;272 ounces.
Therefore, John consumes 272/8 = &lt;&lt;272/8=34&gt;&gt;34 ounces of apples per day.
The rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption is 34/1.1428571428571428 = &lt;&lt;34/1.1428571428571428=30&gt;&gt;30.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The toy car can now travel an additional 33/40 of a kilometer.
To find the total distance the toy car can now travel, we need to add the additional distance to the original distance.
The original distance is 37 kilometers.
The additional distance is 33/40 of a kilometer.
To add these two distances, we need to convert the additional distance to a fraction with a common denominator.
The common denominator is 40.
So, the additional distance is 33/40 of a kilometer.
To add these two distances, we need to add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.
The numerator of the original distance is 37.
The numerator of the additional distance is 33.
So, the total distance is (37 + 33)/40 of a kilometer.
The total distance is 70/40 of a kilometer.
The total distance is 1.75 kilometers.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John walked 14 miles every day for 7 weeks, so he walked 14*49 = &lt;&lt;14*49=686&gt;&gt;686 miles in 7 weeks.
After the 7 weeks, he still needed to walk an additional 21 miles, so he had to walk 686+21 = &lt;&lt;686+21=707&gt;&gt;707 miles in total.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's assume Walter had x dollars originally.
He spent 23/21 dollars on a pen, so he has x - 23/21 dollars left.
We know that he has 46 dollars left, so we can set up the equation:
x - 23/21 = 46
To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
We can do this by adding 23/21 to both sides of the equation:
x - 23/21 + 23/21 = 46 + 23/21
x = 46 + 23/21
To simplify the right side of the equation, we need to find a common denominator for 46 and 23/21.
The common denominator is 21, so we can rewrite 46 as 923/21:
x = 923/21 + 23/21
x = 946/21
Therefore, Walter originally had 946/21 dollars.

To find out how many liters of fuel Tim will have consumed, we need to multiply the fuel consumption per minute by the number of minutes he drives.

Fuel consumption per minute = 41/39 liters
Number of minutes = 47

Fuel consumed = (41/39) * 47

Calculating the answer:
Fuel consumed = (41/39) * 47 = 50.87 liters

So, Tim will have consumed 50.87 liters of fuel.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to find out how much water is left in the tank after pouring out 5/40 gallons.
27/6 - 5/40 = 27/6 - 15/120 = 27/6 - 1/8 = 108/24 - 3/24 = 105/24 gallons.
Then, we need to add 21/26 gallons to the remaining water in the tank.
105/24 + 21/26 = 105/24 + 42/42 = 105/24 + 1/1 = 105/24 + 24/24 = 131/24 gallons.
So, there are 131/24 gallons of water in the tank after all those actions.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
James initially had 33/37 gallons of milk in the jug.
He added 3/25 gallons of milk to the jug.
To find the total amount of milk in the jug, we need to add the initial amount of milk to the amount of milk added.

Solution:
Total amount of milk = (33/37) + (3/25)
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 37 and 25 is 925.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
(33/37) + (3/25) = (33*25)/925 + (3*37)/925
= (825/925) + (111/925)
= (825+111)/925
= 936/925

Therefore, James has 936/925 gallons of milk in total in the jug.

            In the previous problem, James had a jug containing 33/37 gallons of milk to which he added an extra 3/25 gallons. Now, suppose James had 30 similar jugs of milk, each with the same combined volume as the first. What would be the total amount of milk in gallons for all 30 jugs?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
We know that the total amount of milk in the first jug is 936/925 gallons.
Since James has 30 similar jugs, we need to multiply the total amount of milk in the first jug by 30 to find the total amount of milk in all 30 jugs.

Solution:
Total amount of milk in all 30 jugs = (936/925) * 30
= 28080/925
= 30.24 gallons (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the total amount of milk in all 30 jugs is approximately 30.24 gallons.

            A journey took 43/17 hours to complete. After the journey, a break of 31/4 hours was taken. What is the total time spent on the journey and the break?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total time spent on the journey and the break is the sum of the time taken for the journey and the time taken for the break.

The time taken for the journey is 43/17 hours.
The time taken for the break is 31/4 hours.

So, the total time spent on the journey and the break is 43/17 + 31/4 hours.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 17 and 4 is 68. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 68:

43/17 = (43 * 4) / (17 * 4) = 172/68
31/4 = (31 * 17) / (4 * 17) = 527/68

Now, we can add the fractions:

172/68 + 527/68 = 700/68

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

700/68 = (700/2) / (68/2) = 350/34

So, the total time spent on the journey and the break is 350/34 hours.
