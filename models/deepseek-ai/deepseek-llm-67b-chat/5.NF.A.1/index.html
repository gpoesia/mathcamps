        John has been learning to add and subtract fractions at school. He was given a problem during his homework that puzzled him. He had to take the sum of 48/56 and 95/23 and then subtract 34/26 from the result. What was the value that John found for this operation? Answer in simplest form.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we need to perform the following operations:
1. Add 48/56 and 95/23.
2. Subtract 34/26 from the result.

Step 1: Add 48/56 and 95/23
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 56 and 23 is 1284. So, we need to convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1284.

48/56 = (48 * 23) / (56 * 23) = 1104 / 1284
95/23 = (95 * 5) / (23 * 5) = 475 / 1284

Now, we can add the fractions:
1104/1284 + 475/1284 = 1579/1284

Step 2: Subtract 34/26 from the result
To subtract 34/26, we need to convert it to have a denominator of 1284.

34/26 = (34 * 5) / (26 * 5) = 170 / 1284

Now, we can subtract the fractions:
1579/1284 - 170/1284 = 1409/1284

The final answer is 1409/1284, which is already in simplest form.</pre>

        First, add the fractions 88/9 and 28/65. Then subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result. What is the result expressed as a simple fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 88/9 and 28/65. The least common multiple of 9 and 65 is 585. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:
88/9 = 520/585
28/65 = 168/585

Now, we can add the fractions:
520/585 + 168/585 = 688/585

Next, we need to subtract the fraction 18/37 from the result. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 688/585 and 18/37. The least common multiple of 585 and 37 is 21525. So, we can rewrite the fractions as:
688/585 = 15936/21525
18/37 = 1260/21525

Now, we can subtract the fractions:
15936/21525 - 1260/21525 = 14676/21525

Finally, we can simplify the fraction 14676/21525 to its simplest form. The greatest common divisor of 14676 and 21525 is 21. So, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 21:
14676/21525 = (14676/21) / (21525/21) = 696/1025

Therefore, the result is 696/1025.</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerators and denominators of the fractions.
The GCD of 63 and 41 is 1, and the GCD of 44 and 50 is 2.
Next, we simplify the fractions by dividing the numerators and denominators by their respective GCDs.
(63 / 41) simplifies to 1.
(44 / 50) simplifies to 22 / 25.
Finally, we add the simplified fractions together.
1 + 22 / 25 = 1 + 22 / 25 = 26 / 25.
The result is 26 / 25.

        John had 71/41 of a cake left and Emily added 41/77 of another cake to it. How much cake is there in total? Give your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total amount of cake, we need to add the fractions representing the amount of cake John had and the amount of cake Emily added.

John had 71/41 of a cake and Emily added 41/77 of another cake.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 41 and 77 is 3153.

So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

John had (71/41) * (77/77) = 5547/3153 of a cake.
Emily added (41/77) * (41/41) = 1681/3153 of a cake.

Now, we can add the fractions:

Total amount of cake = (5547/3153) + (1681/3153) = 7228/3153

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator. The GCD of 7228 and 3153 is 1.

So, the simplified fraction is 7228/3153.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 65 and 35 is 35.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
10/65 + 56/35 = (10/65) * (1/1) + (56/35) * (2/2) = 10/65 + 112/70
Now, we can add the fractions:
10/65 + 112/70 = (10 * 2) / (65 * 2) + (112 * 1) / (70 * 1) = 20/130 + 112/70
To add the numerators, we add 20 and 112:
20/130 + 112/70 = (20 + 112) / (130 + 70) = 132/200
To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:
132/200 = (132/4) / (200/4) = 33/50
So, the result is 33/50.</pre>

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 81 and 47 is 3777.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
75/81 = (75 * 46) / (81 * 46) = 3450/3777
97/47 = (97 * 80) / (47 * 80) = 7760/3777
Now, we can add the fractions:
3450/3777 + 7760/3777 = (3450 + 7760) / 3777 = 11210/3777
So, the result of adding 75/81 and 97/47 is 11210/3777.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To simplify the expression, we first need to find the common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 94 and 59 is 5466. Now, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator and add them together.

(80 / 94) + (78 / 59) = ((80 * 59) / (94 * 59)) + ((78 * 94) / (59 * 94))

Now, we can add the numerators and keep the common denominator:

((80 * 59) / (94 * 59)) + ((78 * 94) / (59 * 94)) = ((4720) / (5526)) + ((7572) / (5526))

Now, we can add the fractions:

((4720) / (5526)) + ((7572) / (5526)) = (4720 + 7572) / (5526) = 12292 / 5526

Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

12292 / 5526 = 6146 / 2763

So, the simplified form of the expression ((80 / 94) + (78 / 59)) is 6146 / 2763.</pre>

To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 56 and 50 is 2800. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator as:

89/56 = (89 * 50) / (56 * 50) = 4450 / 2800
48/50 = (48 * 56) / (50 * 56) = 2688 / 2800

Now, we can add the fractions:

(4450 / 2800) + (2688 / 2800) = (4450 + 2688) / 2800 = 7138 / 2800

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 14:

7138 / 2800 = (7138 / 14) / (2800 / 14) = 511 / 200

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the sum of 96/11 and 12/5.
To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 11 and 5, which is 55.
So, 96/11 can be rewritten as (96/11) * (5/5) = 480/55.
Now, we can add 480/55 and 12/5:
480/55 + 12/5 = 480/55 + 132/55 = 612/55.
Next, we need to subtract 38/87 from 612/55.
To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 55 and 87, which is 485.
So, 612/55 can be rewritten as (612/55) * (87/87) = 5388/485.
Now, we can subtract 38/87 from 5388/485:
5388/485 - 38/87 = 5388/485 - 440/485 = 4948/485.

First, we need to find the values of 82 divided by 9 and 82 divided by 63.
82 divided by 9 is 9 and 2/9.
82 divided by 63 is 1 and 20/63.
Now, we subtract the two values:
9 and 2/9 - 1 and 20/63 = 8 and 1/9 - 1 and 20/63.
To subtract the whole numbers, we subtract 8 - 1 = 7.
To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 63 is 63.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
1/9 becomes 7/63.
20/63 remains the same.
Now, we subtract the fractions:
7/63 - 20/63 = -13/63.
Finally, we combine the whole number and the fraction:
7 - 13/63 = 6 and 13/63.
So, the resulting value is 6 and 13/63.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to find the sum of 80/91 and 26/24. To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 91 and 24 is 2184. So, we need to convert both fractions to have a denominator of 2184.

80/91 = (80 * 24) / (91 * 24) = 1920 / 2184
26/24 = (26 * 91) / (24 * 91) = 2356 / 2184

Now, we can add the two fractions:
1920 / 2184 + 2356 / 2184 = 4276 / 2184

Next, we need to subtract this sum from 23/3. To do this, we need to convert 23/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 2184.

23/3 = (23 * 728) / (3 * 728) = 16824 / 2184

Now, we can subtract the two fractions:
16824 / 2184 - 4276 / 2184 = 12548 / 2184

Finally, we need to simplify the fraction 12548 / 2184. The greatest common divisor of 12548 and 2184 is 14. So, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 14:

12548 / 2184 = (12548 / 14) / (2184 / 14) = 896 / 156

So, the value of 23/3 minus the sum of 80/91 and 26/24 is 896/156.</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 41 and 62 is 1278.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
33/41 = (33*31)/(41*31) = 1023/1278
95/62 = (95*2)/(62*2) = 190/1278
Now, we can add the fractions:
(1023/1278) + (190/1278) = (1023+190)/1278 = 1213/1278
The sum of 33/41 and 95/62 is 1213/1278.

        Solve ((30 / 11) + (72 / 38)) and then add the result to (81 / 34). Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to add the fractions (30/11) and (72/38). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 11 and 38 is 438, so we can rewrite the fractions with this denominator:

(30/11) = (30 * 38) / (11 * 38) = 1140 / 438
(72/38) = (72 * 11) / (38 * 11) = 8064 / 438

Now we can add the fractions:

(1140 / 438) + (8064 / 438) = (1140 + 8064) / 438 = 9204 / 438

Next, we need to simplify the fraction:

9204 / 438 = 21 * 438 / 3 * 146 = 21 / 3

Now we have the result of the first part of the problem: 21/3.

Next, we need to add this result to (81/34):

(21/3) + (81/34) = (21 * 34) / (3 * 34) + (81 * 1) / (34 * 1) = 714 / 102 + 81 / 34 = (714 + 81) / 102 = 795 / 102

Finally, we need to simplify the fraction:

795 / 102 = 5 * 102 / 3 * 34 = 5 / 1

So the final answer is 5.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for (64 / 34) and (3 / 24). The least common multiple of 34 and 24 is 408, so we can rewrite the fractions as:

(64 / 34) = (64 * 12) / (34 * 12) = (768 / 408)
(3 / 24) = (3 * 17) / (24 * 17) = (51 / 408)

Now we can add the fractions:

(768 / 408) + (51 / 408) = (768 + 51) / 408 = 819 / 408

Next, we need to add the result to (41 / 96):

(819 / 408) + (41 / 96) = (819 * 2) / (408 * 2) + (41 * 4) / (96 * 4) = (1638 / 816) + (164 / 384)

Now we can add the fractions:

(1638 / 816) + (164 / 384) = (1638 + 164) / 816 = 1802 / 816

Finally, we can simplify the fraction:

1802 / 816 = 11 / 6

So the result is 11/6.</pre>

        Daniel has to solve a math problem for his homework that includes fractions. Initially, he has been asked to add 83/73 and 53/77. The result of this step he saved as 'w'. Then, he needs to add 80/76 to the result 'w'. How would he calculate the final answer in simplified fraction form?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we will first add 83/73 and 53/77, then add the result to 80/76.

Step 1: Add 83/73 and 53/77
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 73 and 77 is 5522. So, we will convert both fractions to have a denominator of 5522.

83/73 = (83 * 76) / (73 * 76) = 6208/5522
53/77 = (53 * 73) / (77 * 73) = 3889/5522

Now, we can add the fractions:

6208/5522 + 3889/5522 = 10097/5522

So, the result of this step is w = 10097/5522.

Step 2: Add 80/76 to the result 'w'
To add 80/76 to 10097/5522, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 76 and 5522 is 5522. So, we will convert 80/76 to have a denominator of 5522.

80/76 = (80 * 73) / (76 * 73) = 5840/5522

Now, we can add the fractions:

10097/5522 + 5840/5522 = 15937/5522

So, the final answer in simplified fraction form is 15937/5522.</pre>

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 66 is 660. So, we will convert both fractions to have a denominator of 660.

27/20 = (27 * 33) / (20 * 33) = 891/660
14/66 = (14 * 10) / (66 * 10) = 140/660

Now, we can add the fractions:

891/660 + 140/660 = (891 + 140) / 660 = 1031/660

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1031 and 660. The GCD of 1031 and 660 is 1. So, the fraction is already simplified.

1031/660 = (1031 * 9) / (660 * 9) = 9279/5940
58/18 = (58 * 330) / (18 * 330) = 19180/5940

9279/5940 + 19180/5940 = (9279 + 19180) / 5940 = 28459/5940

First, we need to find the sum of 24/34 and 44/87.
To do this, we need a common denominator, which is the product of the two denominators, 34 and 87.
So, we have:
24/34 + 44/87 = (24*87)/(34*87) + (44*34)/(87*34) = 2112/3002 + 1508/3002 = 3620/3002
Now, we need to find the sum of 14/89 and 3620/3002.
Again, we need a common denominator, which is the product of the two denominators, 89 and 3002.
So, we have:
14/89 + 3620/3002 = (14*3002)/(89*3002) + (3620*89)/(3002*89) = 42030/277998 + 319380/277998 = 361410/277998
Finally, we simplify the fraction:
361410/277998 = 180705/138999 = 36141/27799 = 18070/13899

45/60 = (45 * 5) / (60 * 5) = 225 / 2940

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to add the fractions (8/91) and (49/5). To do this, we need a common denominator, which is 455. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(8/91) + (49/5) = (8*5)/455 + (49*91)/455 = (40/455) + (4409/455)

Now, we can add the numerators and keep the denominator:

(40/455) + (4409/455) = (40 + 4409)/455 = 4449/455

Next, we need to subtract the fraction (32/76) from the result. Again, we need a common denominator, which is 455. So, we rewrite the fraction with the common denominator:

(32/76) = (32*6)/455 = (192/455)

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

(4449/455) - (192/455) = (4449 - 192)/455 = 4257/455

Finally, we simplify the fraction:

4257/455 = 8514/910 = 17028/1820 = 8514/910

So, the result is 8514/910.</pre>

        Calculate the value of ((75 / 45) + (5 / 49)) first. Then add this value with 3 / 58. Provide the answer as a simple fraction.

    <p>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to calculate the value of ((75 / 45) + (5 / 49)).

To do this, we can simplify the fractions:
75 / 45 = 5 / 3 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 15)
5 / 49 remains the same.

Now, we can add the fractions:
(5 / 3) + (5 / 49)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 49 is 49. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
(5 * 16 / 3 * 16) + (5 / 49) = (80 / 48) + (5 / 49)

Now, we can add the fractions:
(80 / 48) + (5 / 49) = (80 * 49) / (48 * 49) + (5 * 48) / (49 * 48) = (3920 / 2352) + (240 / 2352) = (3920 + 240) / 2352 = 4160 / 2352

Now, we can simplify the fraction:
4160 / 2352 = 2080 / 1176 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2) = 1040 / 588 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2 again) = 520 / 294 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2) = 260 / 147 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2)

Now, we have the value of ((75 / 45) + (5 / 49)) as 260 / 147.

Next, we need to add this value with 3 / 58:
(260 / 147) + (3 / 58)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 147 and 58 is 147 * 58 = 8562. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
(260 * 58 / 147 * 58) + (3 * 25 * 147 / 58 * 25 * 147) = (15080 / 8562) + (11025 / 8562)

Now, we can add the fractions:
(15080 / 8562) + (11025 / 8562) = (15080 + 11025) / 8562 = 26105 / 8562

Now, we can simplify the fraction:
26105 / 8562 = 13052 / 4281 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5)

So, the final answer is 13052 / 4281.</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To simplify the expression ((43 / 15) - (33 / 95)), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 15 and 95 is 1425. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(43 / 15) - (33 / 95) = (43 * 95) / (15 * 95) - (33 * 15) / (95 * 15)

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

(43 * 95) / (15 * 95) - (33 * 15) / (95 * 15) = (4085 - 5475) / (1425 * 15)

Next, we simplify the numerator:

(4085 - 5475) / (1425 * 15) = (-1390) / (1425 * 15)

Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of -1390 and 1425 * 15 is 5.

(-1390 / 5) / (1425 * 15 / 5) = (-278) / (285 * 3)

Finally, we can simplify the fraction further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD. The GCD of -278 and 285 * 3 is 1.

(-278) / (285 * 3) = (-278) / (855)

So, the simplified expression is (-278) / (855).</pre>

To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 45 and 36, which is 180.
So, we have ((78 / 45) + (89 / 36)) = ((78 * 4) / 180) + ((89 * 5) / 180) = (312 / 180) + (445 / 180) = (312 + 445) / 180 = 757 / 180.

Now, we need to add this sum to itself.

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.
So, we have (1514 / 2) / (180 / 2) = 757 / 90.

        Find the result when you subtract 91/65 from the sum of 96/40 and 11/99. Leave your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to find the sum of 96/40 and 11/99.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 40 and 99 is 1980.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
96/40 = 240/1980
11/99 = 20/1980
Now, we can add the fractions:
240/1980 + 20/1980 = 260/1980
Next, we simplify the fraction:
260/1980 = 130/990
Now, we subtract 91/65 from the sum:
130/990 - 91/65 = 130/990 - 273/990
To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 990 and 990 is 990.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
130/990 = 130/990
273/990 = 273/990
Now, we can subtract the fractions:
130/990 - 273/990 = -143/990
The answer is: -143/990</pre>

        Consider the fraction 90/81. Add it to 2/66 and simplify your answer to the simplest form. What is the result?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to add the fractions. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 81 and 66 is 198. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

90/81 = 10/9 (by dividing both numerator and denominator by 9)
2/66 = 2/66 (no need to simplify)

Now, we can add the fractions:

(10/9) + (2/66) = (10*7/9*7) + (2/66) = 70/63 + 2/66

Now, we need to find a common denominator for 63 and 66. The least common multiple of 63 and 66 is 198. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

70/63 = 10/9 (by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 10/10)
2/66 = 2/66 (no need to simplify)

Now, we can add the fractions:

(10/9) + (2/66) = (10*22/9*22) + (2/66) = 220/198 + 2/66

Now, we can add the fractions:

(220/198) + (2/66) = (220*3 + 2*33)/198*33 = 660 + 66/6276 = 66/6276

Now, we can simplify the fraction:

66/6276 = 1/96

So, the result of adding 90/81 and 2/66 and simplifying the answer to the simplest form is 1/96.</pre>

73/22 = (73 * 65) / (22 * 65) = 4795/1430

Now, we can add the fractions:

(704/1430) + (4795/1430) = (704 + 4795) / 1430 = 5500/1430

So, the sum of 32/65 and 73/22 is 5500/1430.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to add the whole number 51 to the fraction 93/8.
51 + 93/8 = 51 + 11.625 = 62.625

Next, we need to add the result (62.625) to the fraction 58/44.
62.625 + 58/44 = 62.625 + 1.3181818181818182 = 63.94318181818182

To express this as a simplified fraction, we need to find the common denominator for 1 and 44, which is 44.

So, 63.94318181818182 = 63 + 44/44 = 63 + 1 = 64

Therefore, the final result as a simplified fraction is 64.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to simplify the expression ((68 / 69) + (93 / 7)).

To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 69 and 7, which is 483.

So, we rewrite the expression as ((68 / 69) + (93 / 7)) = ((68 * 7) / (69 * 7) + (93 * 69) / (7 * 69)) = (476 / 483 + 6237 / 483).

Now, we can add the fractions: (476 / 483 + 6237 / 483) = (476 + 6237) / 483 = 6713 / 483.

Next, we need to add this to (3 / 46).

To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 483 and 46, which is 2181.

So, we rewrite the expression as (6713 / 483 + 3 / 46) = (6713 * 4) / (483 * 4) + (3 * 483) / (46 * 483) = (26852 / 1932 + 1449 / 2181).

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 98 and 4 is 98. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

31/98 + 60/4 = 31/98 + 450/98

Now, we can add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:

(31 + 450)/98 = 481/98

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

481/98 = 481/98

So, the result of adding 31/98 to 60/4 is 481/98.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to add the fractions (3/2) and (24/36). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 36 is 36. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(3/2) = (3 * 18) / (2 * 18) = 54/36

Now, we can add the fractions:

(54/36) + (24/36) = (54 + 24) / 36 = 78/36

Next, we simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 18:

(78/36) = (78/18) / (36/18) = 4.333333333333333

So, the answer is 4.333333333333333.</pre>

        Firstly, calculate the sum of 92/54 and 90/13, then from the result take away 46/41. What's the result as a simplified fraction?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to find the sum of 92/54 and 90/13.
To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.
The least common multiple of 54 and 13 is 678.
So, we can rewrite the fractions as:
92/54 = 1624/678
90/13 = 630/678
Now, we can add the fractions:
1624/678 + 630/678 = 2254/678
Next, we need to subtract 46/41 from the result.
To do this, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.
The least common multiple of 678 and 41 is 2766.
So, we can rewrite the fractions as:
2254/678 = 4508/2766
46/41 = 1146/2766
Now, we can subtract the fractions:
4508/2766 - 1146/2766 = 3362/2766
Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.
3362/2766 = 1681/1383
So, the result is 1681/1383.</pre>

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Twice the value of 29/23 is 2 * (29/23).
To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2.
This gives us 2 * (29/23) = (2 * 29) / (2 * 23) = 58/46.
To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.
This gives us 58/46 = 29/23.
Therefore, twice the value of 29/23 is 29/23.

        What is the sum of 29/20 and 17/72? Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 72 is 480. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 480.

29/20 = (29 * 24) / (20 * 24) = 696/480
17/72 = (17 * 6) / (72 * 6) = 102/480

Now, we can add the fractions:

(696/480) + (102/480) = (696 + 102) / 480 = 798/480

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 18:

798/480 = (798/18) / (480/18) = 44/26

So, the sum of 29/20 and 17/72 is 44/26.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we simplify the fractions:

36 / 27 = 4 / 3
80 / 10 = 8
73 / 79 = 73 / 79

Now, we substitute the simplified fractions back into the expression:

((4 / 3) + 8) - (73 / 79)

Next, we perform the addition and subtraction:

(4 / 3 + 8) - (73 / 79) = (16 / 3) - (73 / 79)

To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 79 is 237. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(16 / 3) - (73 / 79) = (16 * 79 / 3 * 79) - (73 * 3 / 79 * 3) = (1324 / 237) - (219 / 237)

Now, we perform the subtraction:

(1324 / 237) - (219 / 237) = (1324 - 219) / 237 = 1105 / 237

So, the simplified value of the expression is 1105 / 237.</pre>

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 75, 43, and 62 is 1815.

Next, we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 1815:

(21 / 75) = (21 * 24 / 75 * 24) = (504 / 1815)
(74 / 43) = (74 * 4 * 1 / 43 * 4 * 1) = (296 / 1815)
(10 / 62) = (10 * 3 * 1 / 62 * 3 * 1) = (30 / 1815)

Now, we can add the fractions:

((504 / 1815) + (296 / 1815)) + (30 / 1815) = (504 + 296 + 30) / 1815 = 830 / 1815

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total sum of the two identical fractions, we first need to find the value of one fraction. The fractions are equal to the sum of 53/18 and 21/99. We can add these fractions together to find the value of one fraction.

53/18 + 21/99 = (53*5 + 21*2)/(18*5*99) = 265/1782

Now that we have the value of one fraction, we can find the total sum of the two identical fractions by multiplying the value of one fraction by 2.

2 * (265/1782) = 530/1782

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 530 and 1782 is 2.

530/2 = 265
1782/2 = 891

So, the simplified fraction is 265/891.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 58/49 and 31/34, which is 49*34 = 1666.
Next, we convert the fractions to have the common denominator:
58/49 becomes (58*34)/(49*34) = 1972/1666
31/34 becomes (31*49)/(34*49) = 1519/1666
Now, we can add the two fractions:
1972/1666 + 1519/1666 = 3491/1666
Finally, we add this result to the fraction 74/38:
(3491/1666) + (74*43)/(38*43) = 3491/1666 + 1062/1666 = 4553/1666

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's first find out how much of the novel Olivia has read after reading the same amount as Evan.
Evan has read 51/18 of the novel, so Olivia has read 51/18 of the novel as well.
Now, let's add the amount Olivia has read after reading the same amount as Evan.
Olivia has read (8/42) of the novel after reading the same amount as Evan.
So, in total, Olivia has read (51/18) + (8/42) of the novel.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 18*42 = 756.
(51/18) + (8/42) = (51*42)/18*42 + (8*18)/18*42 = 2178/756 + 144/756 = 2322/756
Now, let's simplify the fraction 2322/756.
The greatest common divisor of 2322 and 756 is 18, so we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 18.
2322/18 = 129, 756/18 = 42
So, Olivia has read 129/42 of the novel in total.

76/77 = 9168/6534

Now we can add the fractions:

1512/6534 + 9168/6534 = 10680/6534

Next, we need to subtract this sum from 27/6:

27/6 - 10680/6534

To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 6534 is 6534, so we can rewrite the fractions as:

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 39 and 14 is 156. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

73/39 = (73 * 4) / (39 * 4) = 292/156
49/14 = (49 * 11) / (14 * 11) = 539/156

Now, we can add the fractions:

(292/156) + (539/156) = (292 + 539) / 156 = 831/156

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 831 and 156, which is 3:

831/3 = 277
156/3 = 52

So, the simplified fraction is 277/52.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 65 and 39 is 2415.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
75/65 = 1578/2415
7/39 = 171/2415
Now, we can add the fractions:
1578/2415 + 171/2415 = 1749/2415
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9:
1749/2415 = 194/269
So, the sum of 75/65 and 7/39 is 194/269.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 1 and 92, which is 92.
So, 79/1 - 30/92 = 79*92/92 - 30/92 = 7252/92 - 30/92 = 7222/92.
Next, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 61/63 and 7222/92, which is 63*92 = 5856.
So, 7222/92 - 61/63 = 7222*63/5856 - 61*92/5856 = 456156/5856 - 5612/5856 = 450544/5856.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Alex initially had 69/63 gallons of orange juice.
He bought an additional 77/5 gallons, so he had 69/63 + 77/5 = 345/315 + 462/315 = 807/315 gallons.
He received another 47/71 gallons from Sally, so he had 807/315 + 47/71 = 5742/2205 + 329/2205 = 6071/2205 gallons.
To find the total number of gallons Alex had, we need to simplify the fraction 6071/2205.
The greatest common divisor of 6071 and 2205 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.
Therefore, Alex had a total of 6071/2205 gallons.

To find the sum of 92/13 and 43/86, we first need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 86 is 1118.

Next, we convert both fractions to have the same denominator:
92/13 = (92 * 86) / (13 * 86) = 7912/1118
43/86 = (43 * 13) / (86 * 13) = 559/1118

Now, we can add the two fractions:
(7912/1118) + (559/1118) = (7912 + 559) / 1118 = 8471/1118

Finally, we simplify the fraction:
8471/1118 = 4235/559

So, the sum of 92/13 and 43/86 as a simplified fraction is 4235/559.

10/98 = 1564/98 * 10/1564 = 1564/15640
Now, we can add the fractions:
(10343/1564) + (1564/15640) = 10343 + 1564/15640 = 11907/15640

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 52 and 32 is 84. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 84.

59/52 = (59*1.6) / (52*1.6) = 94.4/84
70/32 = (70*2.625) / (32*2.625) = 184.375/84

Now, we can add the fractions:

94.4/84 + 184.375/84 = (94.4 + 184.375) / 84 = 278.775/84

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 0.025.

278.775/84 = (278.775/0.025) / (84/0.025) = 11151/336

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to find the result of (26 / 87) + (92 / 88).
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 87 and 88 is 756. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
(26 / 87) + (92 / 88) = (26 * 8) / 756 + (92 * 8) / 756 = (208 / 756) + (736 / 756)
Now, we can add the fractions:
(208 / 756) + (736 / 756) = (208 + 736) / 756 = 944 / 756
Next, we need to add the result to (26 / 57):
(944 / 756) + (26 / 57) = (944 * 2) / (756 * 2) + (26 * 13) / (57 * 13) = (1888 / 1512) + (338 / 741)
Now, we need a common denominator again. The least common multiple of 1512 and 741 is 10752. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
(1888 / 1512) + (338 / 741) = (1888 * 7) / 10752 + (338 * 14) / 10752 = (13216 / 10752) + (4732 / 10752)
Now, we can add the fractions:
(13216 / 10752) + (4732 / 10752) = (13216 + 4732) / 10752 = 17948 / 10752

        What is the result if you add 78/66, 28/6, and 90/34 together? Please provide your answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 66, 6, and 34 is 36.

First, we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 36:
78/66 = 4 * 19/4 * 19 = 76/36
28/6 = 4 * 7/4 * 7 = 28/12 = 14/6 = 7/3
90/34 = 2 * 45/2 * 45/2 = 90/68 = 45/34

Now, we can add the fractions:
76/36 + 7/3 + 45/34 = 76/36 + 7/3 + 45/34 = (76 + 108 + 45) / 36 = 229/36

The simplified fraction is 229/36.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 23 is 161. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(12 / 7) - (9 / 23) = (12 * 23 / 7 * 23) - (9 * 7 / 23 * 7) = (276 / 161) - (63 / 161)

Now, we can subtract the numerators:

(276 / 161) - (63 / 161) = (276 - 63) / 161 = 213 / 161

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 213 and 161, which is 1. So, the simplified fraction is:

213 / 161 = 106.5 / 80.5

Therefore, (12 / 7) - (9 / 23) = 106.5 / 80.5.</pre>

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 61 is 18 * 61 = 1098.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
95/18 = (95 * 61) / (18 * 61) = 5895/1098
51/61 = (51 * 18) / (61 * 18) = 918/1098
Now, we can add the fractions:
95/18 + 51/61 = 5895/1098 + 918/1098 = (5895 + 918) / 1098 = 6813/1098
To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator:
GCD(6813, 1098) = 3
Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:
6813/1098 = (6813/3) / (1098/3) = 2271/366
The GCD of 2271 and 366 is 3, so the fraction is fully simplified:
2271/366
Therefore, the sum of 95/18 and 51/61 is 2271/366.</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 46 and 84 is 252. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(93 / 46) - (51 / 84) = (93 * 5) / (46 * 5) - (51 * 3) / (84 * 3) = (465 / 230) - (153 / 252)

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

(465 / 230) - (153 / 252) = (465 * 1) / (230 * 1) - (153 * 1) / (252 * 1) = (465 / 230) - (153 / 252)

To subtract the numerators, we subtract 465 - 153 = 312. The denominator remains the same:

(465 / 230) - (153 / 252) = (312 / 230)

Now, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

(312 / 230) = (312 / 4) / (230 / 4) = (78 / 57.5)

So, the simplified fraction is 78/57.5.</pre>

84/9 = (84 * 70) / (9 * 70) = 5880/630

Now, we can add the fractions:

(108/630) + (5880/630) = 5988/630

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9:

First, we need to add 88/93 and 6/47. To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 93 and 47 is 4362. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

88/93 = (88 * 46) / (93 * 46) = 4128 / 4362
6/47 = (6 * 92) / (47 * 92) = 552 / 4362

Now, we can add the fractions:

(4128 / 4362) + (552 / 4362) = 4680 / 4362

Next, we need to add the result (4680 / 4362) to 92/4. Again, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4362 and 4 is 4362. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

First, we need to find the sum of 95/83 and the result of 52/21 + 75/67.
To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 83 and 21 is 1743.
So, we rewrite 95/83 as (95*20)/(83*20) = 1900/1660.
Next, we rewrite 52/21 as (52*8)/(21*8) = 416/168.
Similarly, we rewrite 75/67 as (75*26)/(67*26) = 1950/1742.
Now, we can add the fractions:
1900/1660 + 416/168 + 1950/1742 = (1900*1 + 416*10 + 1950*10)/(1660*1 + 168*10 + 1742*10) = 1900 + 4160 + 19500/1660 + 1680 + 17420 = 24660/35820 = 12330/17910.
Now, we simplify the fraction:
12330/17910 = (12330/10)/(17910/10) = 1233/1791.
So, the sum of 95/83 and the result of 52/21 + 75/67 is 1233/1791.

This simplifies to (584/216) - (115/240).
To subtract the fractions, we need to have a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 216 and 240 is 2160.

Now, we can subtract the fractions: (5840 - 1035) / 2160 = 4805 / 2160.
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.

        In the previous question, we calculated the value of the expression ((73 / 27) - (23 / 48)). Now, suppose we made a mistake and the original fraction was actually 65/27, not 73/27. What would the value of the new expression be? Answer as a simplified fraction.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the value of the new expression ((65/27) - (23/48)), we can follow the same steps as before.
First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.
The least common multiple of 27 and 48 is 216.
So, we can rewrite the expression as ((65/27) * (8/8)) - ((23/48) * (5/5)).
This simplifies to (520/216) - (115/240).
To subtract the fractions, we need to have a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 216 and 240 is 2160.
So, we can rewrite the expression as (520/216) * (10/10) - (115/240) * (9/9).
This simplifies to (5200/2160) - (1035/2160).
Now, we can subtract the fractions: (5200 - 1035) / 2160 = 4165 / 2160.
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.
So, the simplified fraction is 833 / 432.
Therefore, the value of the new expression ((65/27) - (23/48)) is 833/432.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the value of 'd', we need to add the given value of 'v' to the fraction 88/72.

So, d = 88/72 + 69/47

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 72 and 47 is 3384.

Now, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

d = (88/72) * (47/47) + (69/47) * (72/72)
d = (88 * 47) / (72 * 47) + (69 * 72) / (47 * 72)
d = 4232 / 3384 + 4968 / 3384

Now, we can add the fractions:

d = (4232 + 4968) / 3384
d = 9190 / 3384

So, the value of 'd' is 9190/3384.</pre>

We already have the sum of 16/7 and 11/90 as 1517/630. Now, we need to add this to 38/69.

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 630 and 69 is 42930. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 42930.

1517/630 = (1517 * 7) / (630 * 7) = 10619/42930
38/69 = (38 * 630) / (69 * 630) = 24390/42930

Now, we can add the fractions:

(10619/42930) + (24390/42930) = (10619 + 24390) / 42930 = 34909/42930

To add the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 90 is 630. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 630.

16/7 = (16 * 90) / (7 * 90) = 1440/630
99/90 = (99 * 7) / (90 * 7) = 693/630

Now, we can add the fractions:

(1440/630) + (693/630) = (1440 + 693) / 630 = 2133/630

To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2133 and 630, which is 3. So, the simplified fraction is:

(2133/3) / (630/3) = 711/210
