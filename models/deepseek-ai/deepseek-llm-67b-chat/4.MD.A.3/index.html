        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width).
In this case, the length is 22 feet and the width is 39 feet.
So, the perimeter is P = 2(22 + 39) = 2(61) = 122 feet.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.

In this case, the length (L) is 8m and the width (W) is 5m.

So, the perimeter (P) of the garden is:

P = 2(8 + 5)
P = 2(13)
P = 26m

The perimeter of the garden is 26 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width).
In this case, the length is 10 meters and the width is 7 meters.
So, the perimeter is P = 2(10 + 7) = 2(17) = 34 meters.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all its sides. Since a rectangle has opposite sides of equal length, we can calculate the perimeter by adding the lengths of two pairs of opposite sides.

In this case, the length of the rectangle is 30m and the width is 2m. So, the two pairs of opposite sides are:

1. Length: 30m
2. Width: 2m
3. Length: 30m
4. Width: 2m

Now, we can calculate the perimeter by adding the lengths of these sides:

Perimeter = (Length + Width) + (Length + Width)
Perimeter = (30m + 2m) + (30m + 2m)
Perimeter = 32m + 32m
Perimeter = 64m

So, the perimeter of the rectangular field is 64 meters.</pre>

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all its sides. Since a rectangle has opposite sides of equal length, we can calculate the perimeter by adding the length of one side to the length of the opposite side, and then doubling that sum.

In this case, the length of the rectangle is 43 units and the width is 3 units. So, the perimeter P can be calculated as follows:

P = 2 * (length + width)
P = 2 * (43 + 3)
P = 2 * 46
P = 92 units

So, the perimeter of the rectangle is 92 units.</pre>

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all its sides. Since the garden is a rectangle, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(length + width).

Solution:
The perimeter of the garden is P = 2(45 + 50) = 2(95) = 190 meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all its sides. Since a rectangle has opposite sides of equal length, we can calculate the perimeter by adding the length of one side to the length of the opposite side, and then doubling that sum.

In this case, the length of the rectangle is 42 m and the width is 29 m. So, the perimeter P can be calculated as follows:

P = 2 Ã— (length + width)
P = 2 Ã— (42 + 29)
P = 2 Ã— 71
P = 142

The perimeter of the rectangle is 142 m.

The square's side is 49m, so its area is 49*49 = 2401m^2.
The rectangle has twice the length of the square, so its length is 2*49 = 98m.
The rectangle's width is the same as the square's side, so it is 49m.
The rectangle's area is 98*49 = 4802m^2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(L + B), where L is the length and B is the breadth.

In this case, L = 49m and B = 19m.

So, the perimeter of the rectangle is P = 2(49 + 19) = 2(68) = &lt;&lt;2(68)=136&gt;&gt;136m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The new perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(length + width).
In this case, the length is 46m and the width is 45m.
So, the new perimeter is P = 2(46 + 45) = 2(91) = &lt;&lt;2(91)=182&gt;&gt;182m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.
In this case, L = 24m and W = 20m.
So, the perimeter P = 2(24 + 20) = 2(44) = &lt;&lt;2(44)=88&gt;&gt;88m.
