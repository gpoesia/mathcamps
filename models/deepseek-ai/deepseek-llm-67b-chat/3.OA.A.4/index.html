        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The manufacturer can produce 8 watches every hour.
They have manufactured a total of 48 watches.
To find out how many hours they worked, we can divide the total number of watches by the number of watches produced per hour.

48 watches / 8 watches per hour = 6 hours

The manufacturer worked for 6 hours.

If Linda doubles the quantity of one specific model, she would have 2 dolls of that model.
Let's assume Linda currently has x dolls of that model.
If she doubles the quantity, she would have 2x dolls of that model.
According to the problem, 2x = 2.
To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation 2x = 2.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 1.
Therefore, Linda currently has 1 doll of that model.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The distance between the two points is 96 miles.
Each small sector covers 8 miles.
To find the number of sectors between the two points, we need to divide the total distance by the distance covered by each sector.
So, 96 miles / 8 miles = 12 sectors.
Therefore, there are 12 sectors between the two points.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's assume the number of days the compass maker sold compasses is x.
The number of compasses sold each day is 12.
The total number of compasses sold is 84.
We can set up the equation as follows:
Number of compasses sold each day * Number of days = Total number of compasses sold
12 * x = 84
Let's solve for x:
12x = 84
To isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 12:
12x / 12 = 84 / 12
x = 7
The compass maker sold compasses for 7 days.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
If the helicopter company has a policy of ensuring that each of their helicopters gets 10 hours of maintenance for every time it's used, then the number of times the helicopter has been used can be calculated by dividing the total hours of maintenance by the maintenance hours per use.

Let's denote the number of times the helicopter has been used as x.

According to the given information, we can write the equation:

10x = 70

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 70 / 10
x = 7

So, the helicopter has been used 7 times.

If a dolphin can jump 5 times in a single minute, then in 'p' minutes it can jump 5*p times.
We know that the dolphin can jump 60 times in 'p' minutes.
So, 5*p = 60
To find the value of 'p', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5.
p = 60/5
p = 12

Let's assume the amount of fabric used to make 3 pillows is x.
According to the given information, if the fabric used is divided by 6, that results in the number of pillows that can be made from it.
So, x/6 = 3
To find the amount of fabric used, we need to solve for x.
x = 3 * 6
x = 18
Therefore, 18 units of fabric are used to make these 3 pillows.

If each plane section accounts for 8 parts, then the total number of parts is equal to the number of sections multiplied by 8.
Let's represent the number of sections as x.
So, 8x = 48
Dividing both sides by 8, we get:
x = 48/8
x = 6
Therefore, the plane originally had 6 sections before the crash.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the original price of the jacket as &quot;d&quot; dollars.
After the discount, the price of the jacket is 1/5th of its original price, which is 6 dollars.
So, we can write the equation:
1/5 * d = 6
To find the original price of the jacket, we need to solve for &quot;d&quot;.
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 5, we get:
d = 6 * 5
d = 30
The original price of the jacket was 30 dollars.
