        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To subtract the two numbers, we line them up as follows:

24.429
-13.777
________

Starting from the rightmost column, we subtract the digits:

9 - 7 = 2
2 - 7 = -5 (we borrow 1 from the 4 in the tens column, making it 3)
3 - 1 = 2
4 - 3 = 1
2 - 1 = 1

So, the result is:

24.429
-13.777
________
10.652

Therefore, 24.429 - 13.777 = 10.652.</pre>

To subtract the numbers, we line them up according to their decimal places and subtract each place value.

61.571
-26.25
--------

Starting from the rightmost column, we subtract 1 from 7, which gives us 6.
Moving to the next column, we subtract 5 from 5, which gives us 0.
In the next column, we subtract 2 from 1, which gives us -1. Since we can't have a negative number in this place value, we borrow 1 from the 6 in the tens place. This gives us 15 - 2 = 13.
Finally, we subtract 26 from 61, which gives us 35.

So, 61.571 - 26.25 = 35.321.

To subtract the result of 72.18 - 30.17 from 99.7, we first find the result of the subtraction and then subtract it from 99.7.

72.18 - 30.17 = 42.01

Now, we subtract 42.01 from 99.7:

99.7 - 42.01 = 57.69

The result of subtracting the result of 72.18 - 30.17 from 99.7 is 57.69.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total length of the walking paths after the addition, we need to add the current length of the walking paths to the planned addition.

Current length of walking paths = 18 kilometers
Planned addition = 30.7 kilometers

Total length of walking paths = Current length + Planned addition
Total length of walking paths = 18 + 30.7
Total length of walking paths = 48.7 kilometers

To subtract 3.42 from 47.434, we align the decimal points and subtract each place value.

47.434
- 3.42
--------

Starting from the rightmost column, we subtract 2 from 4, which gives us 2. We write down the 2 and carry over the 1 to the next column.

In the next column, we subtract 3 from 14 (including the carried over 1), which gives us 11. We write down the 11.

In the next column, we subtract 4 from 7 (including the carried over 1), which gives us 4. We write down the 4.

Finally, in the leftmost column, we subtract 3 from 4 (including the carried over 1), which gives us 1. We write down the 1.

So, 47.434 - 3.42 = 44.014.

To subtract 20.923 from 98.5, we need to align the decimal points and subtract each digit in the respective place value.

98.5
-20.923
________

Starting from the rightmost digit, we subtract 3 from 5, which gives us 2. We write down the 2 and carry over the 1 to the next place value.

Next, we subtract 2 (carried over) and 2 from 8, which gives us 6. We write down the 6 and carry over the 1 to the next place value.

Finally, we subtract 1 (carried over) and 9 from 9, which gives us 8. We write down the 8.

To subtract decimals, we align the decimal points and subtract digit by digit, starting from the rightmost digit.

47.42
-24.567
________

First, subtract the rightmost digits: 2 - 7 = -5. Since the result is negative, we need to borrow from the next digit.

47.42
-24.567
________

Next, borrow from the 4 in the tens place: 4 becomes 3 and 1 is added to the 2 in the ones place, making it 12. Now, subtract 12 - 5 = 7.

47.42
-24.567

Continue subtracting digit by digit: 7 - 6 = 1, 4 - 5 = -1 (borrow from the next digit), 3 - 2 = 1, and 1 - 0 = 1.

To find the sum of 69.17 and 27.984, we add the whole numbers and the decimal parts separately.

Step 1: Add the whole numbers.
69 + 27 = 96

0.17 + 0.984 = 1.154

Step 3: Combine the whole numbers and the decimal parts.
96 + 1.154 = 97.154

The sum of 69.17 and 27.984 is 97.154.

To subtract the numbers, we line them up as follows:

54.669
-25.08
_______

Starting with the ones place, we subtract 6 from 5, which is not possible. So, we borrow 1 from the tens place, making it 4. Now, we can subtract 6 - 5, which gives us 1. We write down the 1 and carry over the 10 to the tens place.

Next, we subtract 4 (borrowed 1) from 4 (borrowed 1), which gives us 8. We write down the 8 and carry over the 10 to the hundreds place.

Now, we subtract 1 (carried over) from 5, which gives us 4. We write down the 4 and carry over the 10 to the thousands place.

Finally, we subtract 1 (carried over) from 5, which gives us 4. We write down the 4.

First, we need to add 7.8 and 13.7 together.

To subtract 27.182 from 87.76, we line up the decimal points and subtract each place value.

87.76
-27.182
________

Starting from the rightmost column, we subtract 2 from 6, which results in a negative number. To handle this, we borrow 1 from the 7 in the tens place, making it 6. Now, we can subtract 2 from 16, which gives us 14.

Next, we subtract 1 from 7, which gives us 6.

Finally, we subtract 27 from 80, which gives us 53.

So, the result of subtracting 27.182 from 87.76 is 53.578.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the remaining value after subtracting 77.217 from the sum of 45.59 and 36.61, we first find the sum of 45.59 and 36.61, and then subtract 77.217 from the sum.

Step 1: Find the sum of 45.59 and 36.61
45.59 + 36.61 = 82.2

Step 2: Subtract 77.217 from the sum
82.2 - 77.217 = 4.983
