        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to divide 27 by 12.
27 ï¿½ 12 = 2 R 3
So, 27 divided by 12 is equal to 2 with a remainder of 3.

Now, we need to multiply 7 by the result of dividing 27 by 12.
7 Ã— 2 = 14

So, the result of the problem is 14.

However, the problem asks for the answer as a simplified fraction.
Since the division result is 2 with a remainder of 3, we can write it as a mixed number: 2 3/12.

Now, we need to multiply 7 by the mixed number 2 3/12.
7 Ã— 2 = 14
7 Ã— 3/12 = 21/12

So, the result of the problem as a simplified fraction is 14 + 21/12.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 12 and 12 is 12.

14 + 21/12 = 14 Ã— 1/1 + 21/12 = 14/1 + 21/12 = 168/12 + 21/12 = 189/12

So, the result of the problem as a simplified fraction is 189/12.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

First, we can simplify the fractions in the expression:

24 / 22 = 12 / 11
24 / 17 = 12 / 8.5

Now, we can rewrite the expression with the simplified fractions:

((12 / 11) * (12 / 8.5))

Next, we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately:

(12 * 12) / (11 * 8.5)

Now, we can simplify the numerator and denominator:

144 / 93.5

Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 0.5:

144 / 0.5 = 288
93.5 / 0.5 = 187

So, the simplified fraction is 288 / 187.

We already found the result of ((24 / 22) * (24 / 17)) to be 288 / 187.

Now, we need to multiply this result by (27 / 18):

(288 / 187) * (27 / 18)

First, we can simplify the fractions in the expression:

288 / 187 = 144 / 93.5
27 / 18 = 13.5 / 9

Now, we can rewrite the expression with the simplified fractions:

(144 / 93.5) * (13.5 / 9)

Next, we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately:

(144 * 13.5) / (93.5 * 9)

Now, we can simplify the numerator and denominator:

1944 / 839.5

Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 0.5:

1944 / 0.5 = 3888
839.5 / 0.5 = 1679

So, the simplified fraction is 3888 / 1679.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
We can simplify the expression by canceling out common factors in the numerator and denominator.

((18 / 19) * (19 / 6)) = (18 * 19) / (19 * 6) = 342 / 114

Now, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

The GCD of 342 and 114 is 42.

So, (342 / 114) = (342 / 42) / (114 / 42) = 8 / 3

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 8/3.

            A cargo ship carries 28/21 of its capacity in the morning, and 22/4 of its capacity in the afternoon. If the cargo in the morning represents the load allocated to consumer goods and the cargo in the afternoon represents industrial supplies, what is the total fractional representation of these two types of cargo hauled in one day?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total fractional representation of the two types of cargo hauled in one day, we need to multiply the fractions representing the cargo in the morning and the cargo in the afternoon.

The cargo in the morning is represented by the fraction 28/21, and the cargo in the afternoon is represented by the fraction 22/4.

To multiply these fractions, we multiply the numerators and the denominators separately:

(28/21) * (22/4) = (28 * 22) / (21 * 4) = 616 / 84

Now, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

616 / 84 = (616 / 2) / (84 / 2) = 308 / 42

Finally, we simplify the fraction again by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

308 / 42 = (308 / 2) / (42 / 2) = 154 / 21

So, the total fractional representation of the two types of cargo hauled in one day is 154/21.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
30/10 * 30/5 = (30*30)/(10*5) = 900/50
To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 900 and 50 is 50.
So, 900/50 = (900/50)/(50/50) = 18/1
The simplified fraction is 18/1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many batches of cookies the baker can make, we need to divide the total amount of sugar needed for one batch (26 cups) by the fraction of a batch that can be made (29/14).

So, we have:

(26 / 1) / (29 / 14)

To divide fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction:

(26 / 1) * (14 / 29)

Now, we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately:

(26 * 14) / (1 * 29)

364 / 29

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

First, we need to simplify the expression by dividing the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

The GCD of 24 and 11 is 1, so the fraction 24/11 remains the same.

The GCD of 27 and 26 is 1, so the fraction 27/26 remains the same.

Now, we can multiply the two fractions:

(24/11) * (27/26) = (24 * 27) / (11 * 26) = 648 / 286

Next, we need to simplify the fraction 648/286 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD.

The GCD of 648 and 286 is 14, so we can simplify the fraction as follows:

648 / 14 = 46
286 / 14 = 20

So, the simplified fraction is 46/20.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the expression, we first need to simplify the fractions in the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 28 / 16
We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 28 and 16 is 4.
28 ï¿½ 4 = 7
16 ï¿½ 4 = 4
So, 28 / 16 simplifies to 7 / 4.

Denominator: 27 / 24
We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD. The GCD of 27 and 24 is 3.
27 ï¿½ 3 = 9
24 ï¿½ 3 = 8
So, 27 / 24 simplifies to 9 / 8.

Now, we can rewrite the expression as:
(7 / 4) / (9 / 8)

To divide fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction:
(7 / 4) * (8 / 9)

Now, we multiply the numerators and denominators:
(7 * 8) / (4 * 9)
56 / 36

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD. The GCD of 56 and 36 is 4.
56 ï¿½ 4 = 14
36 ï¿½ 4 = 9

So, the result of the expression is 14 / 9.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how much of the ingredient they will require, we need to multiply the amount of the recipe they want to make by the amount of the ingredient required for the whole recipe.

The amount of the recipe they want to make is 30/4, and the amount of the ingredient required for the whole recipe is 19/28.

So, the amount of the ingredient they will require is (30/4) * (19/28).

To multiply these fractions, we need to multiply the numerators and denominators separately.

The numerator of the product is (30 * 19) = 570.
The denominator of the product is (4 * 28) = 112.

So, the amount of the ingredient they will require is 570/112.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 570 and 112.

The GCD of 570 and 112 is 4.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4, we get 570/4 = 142.5 and 112/4 = 28.

So, the amount of the ingredient they will require is 142.5/28.

To simplify this fraction further, we need to find the GCD of 142.5 and 28.

The GCD of 142.5 and 28 is 1.

So, the amount of the ingredient they will require is 142.5/28.

Therefore, the bakery will require 142.5/28 of the ingredient.

First, we need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses.

(5 / 2) = 2.5
(26 / 15) = 1.73333 (approximately)

Now, we can substitute these values back into the original expression.

((5 / 2) / (26 / 15)) = (2.5 / 1.73333)

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal.

(2.5 / 1.73333) = 2.5 * (1 / 1.73333)

Now, we can multiply the numerators and denominators.

(2.5 * 1) / (1.73333 * 1) = 2.5 / 1.73333

Finally, we can simplify the fraction.

2.5 / 1.73333 = 1.45 (approximately)

So, the result of ((5 / 2) / (26 / 15)) is approximately 1.45.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To calculate the result of the expression (9/3) * (27/28), we first simplify each fraction and then multiply them.

Simplifying the fractions:
9/3 = 3 (since 9 divided by 3 is 3)
27/28 remains the same as it is already in its simplest form.

Multiplying the fractions:
3 * (27/28) = 81/28

So, the result of the expression (9/3) * (27/28) is 81/28.</pre>

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
(9 / 7) * (25 / 30) = (9 * 25) / (7 * 30) = 225 / 210
Now, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 225 and 210 is 15.
So, 225 / 15 = 15 and 210 / 15 = 14
Therefore, the simplified fraction is 15 / 14.

Now, let's perform the division:

1.125 / 1.111 = 1.013 (approximately)

To express this as a simplified fraction, we need to find the common denominator for 101 and 103 (the numerators and denominators of the decimal approximation). The common denominator is 1030.

So, 1.013 as a simplified fraction is 101/103.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
First, we need to simplify the fractions in the expression.
The numerator of the first fraction is 30 and the denominator is 6, so the fraction is 30/6.
The numerator of the second fraction is 13 and the denominator is 9, so the fraction is 13/9.
Now, we can rewrite the expression as (30/6) / (13/9).
Next, we can simplify the fractions by dividing the numerator and denominator of each fraction by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 30 and 6 is 6, so we can simplify 30/6 to 5/1.
The GCD of 13 and 9 is 1, so we can simplify 13/9 to 13/9.
Now, we can rewrite the expression as (5/1) / (13/9).
To divide fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.
The reciprocal of 13/9 is 9/13.
So, we can rewrite the expression as (5/1) * (9/13).
Now, we can multiply the numerators and denominators of the fractions.
The numerator of the first fraction is 5 and the denominator is 1, so the fraction is 5/1.
The numerator of the second fraction is 9 and the denominator is 13, so the fraction is 9/13.
Multiplying the numerators gives us 5 * 9 = 45.
Multiplying the denominators gives us 1 * 13 = 13.
So, the expression simplifies to 45/13.
Therefore, the result of performing the operation (30 / 6) / (13 / 9) is 45/13.

So, ((11 / 9) * (29 / 6)) = 319 / 54

Now, let's multiply the result by (11 / 5):

Numerator: 319 * 11 = 3509
Denominator: 54 * 5 = 270

So, ((11 / 9) * (29 / 6)) * (11 / 5) = 3509 / 270

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 3509 and 270 is 1.

So, the simplified fraction is 3509 / 270.

To solve the problem, we need to multiply the numerators and denominators of the fractions separately.

Numerator: 21 * 29 = 609
Denominator: 9 * 6 = 54

So, ((21 / 9) * (29 / 6)) = 609 / 54

The fraction 609/54 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 9.

609 ï¿½ 9 = 67
54 ï¿½ 9 = 6

So, the simplified fraction is 67 / 6.

First, we simplify the numerator and denominator separately:
(29 / 2) = 14.5

Now, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
14.5 / 1.2105263157894736 = 11.95474479095251
Therefore, the result of the expression is 11.95474479095251.
However, since the question asks for the answer as a simplified fraction, we need to convert the decimal to a fraction.
11.95474479095251 can be written as 1195474479095251 / 1000000000000000.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
So, the product of 11/19 and 25/7 is (11*25)/(19*7).
Calculating the numerator and denominator, we get 275/133.
To simplify the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 275 and 133, which is 1.
Since the GCD is 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.
Therefore, the product of 11/19 and 25/7 is 275/133.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
So, 30 * 16/27 = (30 * 16) / (1 * 27) = 480/27.
The fraction 480/27 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 27.
So, 480/27 = 18.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To solve the problem, we need to perform the division and multiplication operations.

First, we perform the division operation: 30 / 23 = 1 R 7. This means that 30 divided by 23 is 1 with a remainder of 7.

Next, we multiply the remainders: 7 * 19 = 133.

Finally, we divide the product by the divisor: 133 / 24 = 5 R 13. This means that 133 divided by 24 is 5 with a remainder of 13.

So, the simplified fraction for ((30 / 23) * (19 / 24)) is 5 R 13.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
We can simplify the expression by canceling out common factors in the numerator and denominator.

(23 / 26) * (16 / 1) = (1 * 23) / (2 * 13) * (16 / 1)

Now, we can cancel out the common factor of 1 in the numerator and denominator of the first fraction:

(23 / 26) * (16 / 1) = (23 / 13) * (16 / 1)

Now, we can cancel out the common factor of 1 in the numerator and denominator of the second fraction:

(23 / 26) * (16 / 1) = (23 / 13) * (16 / 1) = (23 * 16) / (13 * 1)

Now, we can simplify the expression by multiplying the numerators and denominators:

(23 / 26) * (16 / 1) = (23 * 16) / (13 * 1) = 368 / 13

So, the simplified expression is 368 / 13.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
We can simplify the expression by first simplifying the fractions in the numerator and denominator.

21 / 1 = 21
26 / 20 = 13 / 10

Now, we can rewrite the expression as:

(21 / (13 / 10))

To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 13 / 10 is 10 / 13.

So, the expression becomes:

(21 * (10 / 13))

Now, we can multiply the numerators and denominators:

(21 * 10) / (13)

210 / 13

The fraction 210 / 13 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

So, the simplified fraction is:

210 / 13

Therefore, the answer is 210 / 13.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total amount of sugar and flour needed for the larger cake, we need to multiply the amount of sugar and flour by the same factor. Let's call this factor x.

The amount of sugar needed for the larger cake is (12/2) * x = 6x.
The amount of flour needed for the larger cake is (17/14) * x = (17/14)x.

To find the total amount of sugar and flour needed, we add the two amounts together:

Total amount = 6x + (17/14)x

To simplify the expression, we need to find a common denominator for 6 and 17/14. The common denominator is 14.

Total amount = (6 * 7/7)x + (17/14)x
Total amount = (42/7)x + (17/14)x
Total amount = (42 + 17)/14x
Total amount = 59/14x

So, the total amount of sugar and flour needed for the larger cake is 59/14 times the factor x.

First, we need to simplify the fractions in the numerator and denominator.

21 / 16 = 21/16 = 1.3125
27 / 23 = 27/23 = 1.1739

Now, we can perform the division operation:

(1.3125) / (1.1739) = 1.1158

To represent this as a simplified fraction, we need to find the common denominator for 11158 and 10000 (the number of decimal places). The common denominator is 10000.

11158 / 10000 = 1.1158

So, the simplified fraction is 11158/10000.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the result of the expression (19 / 3) * (8 / 15), we first need to simplify the fractions.

19 / 3 can be simplified to 6 1/3, and 8 / 15 can be simplified to 8/15.

Now, we can multiply the two fractions:

(6 1/3) * (8/15) = (6 * 8 + 1 * 8) / (3 * 15) = (48 + 8) / 45 = 56 / 45.

So, the result of the expression is 56/45.</pre>

First, we need to perform the division operation:
13 / 3 = 4 R 1
Since we can't have a remainder in a fraction, we need to convert the remainder into a fraction:
13 / 3 = 4 1/3
Now, we multiply the result by the second fraction:
(4 1/3) * (7 / 25) = (13 / 3) * (7 / 25)

To multiply these two fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately:
(13 * 7) / (3 * 25) = 91 / 75

Answer: 91/75

The change in scenario affects the final result by changing the fraction that is being multiplied by (7 / 25). In the previous problem, the result was 7/5, and in this scenario, the result is 91/75.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
So, (25/20 * 11/6) * 20/26 = (275/120) * 20/26 = (275*20)/(120*26).
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.
So, (275*20)/(120*26) simplifies to (275*20*5)/(120*26*5) = 2750/1300.
To simplify further, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50.
So, 2750/1300 simplifies to (2750/50)/(1300/50) = 55/26.

First, we calculate the product of 25/20 and 11/6, which is 275/120.
Then, we multiply that result by 20/26, which gives us (275/120) * (20/26) = 5500/3120.
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 20.
So, 5500/3120 simplifies to (5500/20)/(3120/20) = 275/156.

Now, if we initially multiplied 25/17 by 11/6, the product would be (25*11)/(17*6) = 275/102.
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.
So, 275/102 simplifies to (275/5)/(102/5) = 55/20.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To simplify the expression, we first need to simplify the fractions in the numerator and denominator.

The numerator is 7/2, which cannot be simplified further.

The denominator is 25/10, which can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.

25/10 simplifies to 5/2.

Now we can rewrite the expression as (7/2) / (5/2).

To divide fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.

So, (7/2) / (5/2) becomes (7/2) * (2/5).

Multiplying the numerators and denominators, we get (7*2) / (2*5) = 14/10.

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.

14/10 simplifies to 7/5.

Therefore, the value of (7/2) / (25/10) is 7/5.

First, we need to perform the division operations:

The original expression was ((20 / 22) * (14 / 11)) and the new expression is ((20 / 22) * (14 / 2)).

The main difference between the two expressions is the second fraction in the multiplication. In the original expression, the second fraction was (14 / 11), while in the new expression, it is (14 / 2).

Now, let's evaluate the new expression:

First, we perform the division: 20 / 22 = 10 / 11.

Next, we multiply the resulting fractions: (10 / 11) * (14 / 2) = 140 / 22.

To simplify the fraction, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 140 and 22. The GCD of 140 and 22 is 2.

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
So, (754/255) * (21/9) = (754*21) / (255*9) = 15894/23445.
To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 15894 and 23445 is 9.
So, 15894/9 = 1766 and 23445/9 = 2605.

First, we need to simplify the expression by dividing the numerator and denominator of each fraction separately.

17 / 13 = 1 R 4
15 / 6 = 2 R 3

So, the expression becomes ((4 / 13) * (3 / 2)).

Now, we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately.

Numerator: 4 * 3 = 12
Denominator: 13 * 2 = 26

So, the simplified fraction is 12 / 26.

To further simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 26.

The factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
The factors of 26 are: 1, 2, 13, and 26.

The GCD of 12 and 26 is 2.

Now, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

Numerator: 12 / 2 = 6
Denominator: 26 / 2 = 13

So, the simplified fraction is 6 / 13.

To solve the problem, we need to multiply the numerators and denominators separately.

Numerator: 16 * 26 = 416
Denominator: 16 * 22 = 352

So, the simplified fraction is 416 / 352.

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator.

The GCD of 416 and 352 is 16.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:

Numerator: 416 / 16 = 26
Denominator: 352 / 16 = 22

So, the simplified fraction is 26 / 22.

First, we need to find the result of the previous problem: (16 / 16) * (26 / 22).

The simplified fraction is 26 / 22.

Now, we need to square this result: (26 / 22) * (26 / 22).

To square the fraction, we multiply the numerator by the numerator and the denominator by the denominator:

Numerator: 26 * 26 = 676
Denominator: 22 * 22 = 484

So, the squared fraction is 676 / 484.

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator.

The GCD of 676 and 484 is 14.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:

Numerator: 676 / 14 = 48
Denominator: 484 / 14 = 34

So, the simplified fraction is 48 / 34.

Denominator: 12 * 22 = 264

So, the fraction is 416 / 264.

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator.

The GCD of 416 and 264 is 8.

Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD:

Numerator: 416 / 8 = 52
Denominator: 264 / 8 = 33

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 990 and 56 is 2.
So, 990/56 = (990/2) / (56/2) = 495/28.
The simplified fraction is 495/28.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
So, (15/12) * (27/5) = (15 * 27) / (12 * 5) = 405/60.
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 405 and 60 is 15.
So, 405/60 = (405/15) / (60/15) = 27/4.
The simplified fraction is 27/4.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The expression (7 / 7) * (12 / 12) can be simplified by canceling out the common factors in the numerator and denominator.

(7 / 7) * (12 / 12) = 1 * 1 = 1

So, the answer to the math problem is 1.</pre>

First, we simplify the fractions:
28/6 = 14/3
16/24 = 2/3

Now, we perform the multiplication:
(14/3) * (2/3) = 28/9

So, the result is 28/9.</pre>
