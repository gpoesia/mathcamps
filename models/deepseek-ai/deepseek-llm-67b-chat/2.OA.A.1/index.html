    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
John spends 7 hours working on a puzzle.
He takes an additional amount of time 'b' to finish the puzzle completely.
Altogether, he spends 13 hours working on the puzzle.
To find out how many additional hours he spends to finish the puzzle, we can subtract the time he spent initially from the total time.
So, b = 13 - 7

Calculating the value of b:
b = 13 - 7
b = 6

John spends an additional 6 hours to finish the puzzle.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's assume Jack initially had x building blocks.
After losing 64 building blocks, he is left with 24 building blocks.
So, x - 64 = 24
To find the initial number of building blocks, we need to solve for x.
Adding 64 to both sides of the equation, we get:
x = 24 + 64
x = 88
Therefore, Jack initially had 88 building blocks.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total number of edges in the pattern is 80, and this includes the edges of the pentagon.
Since the pentagon has 5 edges, we can subtract this from the total number of edges to find the number of edges in the pattern before the pentagon was added.
So, the number of edges in the pattern before the pentagon was added is 80 - 5 = 75.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the original angle of the sun above the horizon as 'x'. According to the problem, if we decrease this angle by 24 degrees, it becomes 52 degrees. So, we can write the equation as:

x - 24 = 52

Now, we can solve for 'x' by adding 24 to both sides of the equation:

x - 24 + 24 = 52 + 24

x = 76

So, the original angle of the sun above the horizon was 76 degrees.

Let's assume the hat maker originally had x hats.
After selling 46 hats, he is left with 32 hats.
So, the equation is x - 46 = 32.
To find the original number of hats, we need to solve for x.
Adding 46 to both sides of the equation, we get x = 32 + 46.
So, the hat maker originally had x = 78 hats.

        In a large dormitory, there are a certain number of beds. When 8 beds were removed for repair, there were still 72 beds left. How many beds were there in the dormitory originally?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's assume the number of beds in the dormitory originally is x.
When 8 beds were removed, the number of beds left is x - 8.
We know that x - 8 = 72.
To find the original number of beds, we need to solve for x.
Adding 8 to both sides of the equation, we get x = 72 + 8.
Therefore, the original number of beds in the dormitory is x = 80.
The answer is: 80</pre>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's assume Lily has x dolls.
If she were to donate 5 dolls, she would have x - 5 dolls left.
According to the problem, x - 5 = 52.
To find the value of x, we need to add 5 to both sides of the equation:
x - 5 + 5 = 52 + 5
x = 57
Therefore, Lily has 57 dolls in total.

        A teacher initially had 'a' sheets of special star stickers in her drawer. She then used 60 stickers for rewarding her students in class, and now she has only 2 sheets left. How many sheets of star stickers did the teacher initially have in her drawer?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the number of stickers per sheet as 'x'.
The teacher initially had 'a' sheets of stickers, so she had a*x stickers in total.
She used 60 stickers, so she has a*x - 60 stickers left.
Now she has 2 sheets left, so she has 2*x stickers left.
We can set up the equation: a*x - 60 = 2*x
Solving for 'a':
a*x = 2*x + 60
a = 2 + 60/x
Since we don't know the value of 'x', we cannot find the exact value of 'a'. However, we can express 'a' in terms of 'x'.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the number of animals at the start of the day as s.
During the day, 24 animals were moved to a separate area, so the number of animals in the main section of the zoo decreased by 24.
After this, there were still 75 animals visible to visitors in the main section of the zoo.
So, the number of animals in the main section of the zoo after the move is s - 24.
We know that this number is equal to 75, so we can write the equation:
s - 24 = 75

p = 11 + 21

        A school bus has numerous seats. After 17 students have alighted from the bus, there are 56 students still seated. How many students were initially on the school bus?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's assume the number of students initially on the bus is X.
After 17 students alighted, there were 56 students still seated.
So, X - 17 = 56
To find the initial number of students, we need to add 17 to both sides of the equation.
X = 56 + 17
X = 73
Therefore, there were initially 73 students on the school bus.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the initial number of bars of soap as x.
After donating 9 bars, there are 81 bars left, so x - 9 = 81.
To find the initial number of bars, we need to solve the equation x - 9 = 81.
Adding 9 to both sides of the equation, we get x = 90.
Therefore, there were initially 90 bars of soap in the big storage.

        There were initially 37 butterflies in the park. The number dropped such that there were 20 butterflies left. How many butterflies had left the park?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The number of butterflies that left the park is the difference between the initial number of butterflies and the number of butterflies that remained.
The number of butterflies that left the park is 37 - 20 = &lt;&lt;37-20=17&gt;&gt;17.

        A hat shop initially has a total of (z) hats. After selling 27 hats, there were 25 hats left in the store. How many hats did the store initially have?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the initial number of hats as z.
After selling 27 hats, there were 25 hats left in the store.
So, the equation is z - 27 = 25.
To find the initial number of hats, we need to solve for z.
Adding 27 to both sides of the equation, we get z = 25 + 27.
So, the store initially had z = 52 hats.
The answer is: 52</pre>

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Ronnie has 77 pairs of socks in total. Out of these, 52 pairs are white.
To find the number of non-white socks, we subtract the number of white socks from the total number of socks.
So, Ronnie has 77 - 52 = &lt;&lt;77-52=25&gt;&gt;25 pairs of non-white socks.
