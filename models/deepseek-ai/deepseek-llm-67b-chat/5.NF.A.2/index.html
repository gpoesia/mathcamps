        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total distance the ball traveled, we need to add the distances Kyle and Lisa threw the ball.

Kyle threw the ball for 18/4 yards, which is equivalent to 4.5 yards.
Lisa threw the ball for 19/9 yards, which is equivalent to 2.1111 yards.

Total distance = 4.5 + 2.1111 = 6.6111 yards.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total number of bananas given to Johnnie, we need to add the number of bananas given in the morning and the number of bananas given in the afternoon.

In the morning, Johnnie was given 18/7 bananas.
In the afternoon, Johnnie was given 12/14 bananas.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 14 is 14. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 14:

18/7 = (18 * 2) / (7 * 2) = 36/14
12/14

Now, we can add the fractions:

36/14 + 12/14 = (36 + 12) / 14 = 48/14

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 14:

48/14 = (48/14) / (14/14) = 48/14 = 3

So, Johnnie was given a total of 3 bananas.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many liters of apple juice are left unused, we need to subtract the amount used from the total amount required.

Total amount required = 17/3 liters
Amount used = 15/11 liters

Unused amount = Total amount required - Amount used
Unused amount = (17/3) - (15/11)

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 11 is 33. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(17/3) = (17 * 11/3 * 11) = 205/33
(15/11) = (15 * 3/11 * 3) = 45/33

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

Unused amount = (205/33) - (45/33) = 160/33

So, 160/33 liters of apple juice are left unused.

To find the total portion of the treasure map that Captain Silverbeard found, we need to add the portions he found at each site.

The portion of the treasure map that Captain Silverbeard found at the first site is 10/13.
The portion of the treasure map that Captain Silverbeard found at the second site is 16/19.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 19 is 247.

So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

16/19 = (16 * 13) / (19 * 13) = 208/247

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total length of the rope, we need to add the lengths of the two pieces of rope.
The first piece of rope is 15/12 meters long, which is equivalent to 1 3/12 meters.
The second piece of rope is 17/17 meters long, which is equivalent to 1 meter.
To add the lengths of the two pieces of rope, we need to convert them to the same unit.
Since 15/12 meters is equivalent to 1 3/12 meters, we can rewrite it as 1 + 3/12 meters.
Now we can add the lengths of the two pieces of rope:
1 + 3/12 + 1 = 2 + 3/12 = 2 3/12 meters.
To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 3:
2 3/12 = 2 1/4 meters.
Therefore, the total length of the rope is 2 1/4 meters.
The answer is: 2\frac{1}{4}</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The initial height of the cloud was 12/3 kms.
The cloud ascended by 15/12 kms.
To find the resultant height, we need to add the initial height and the distance it ascended.

Calculating the resultant height:
Resultant height = Initial height + Distance ascended
Resultant height = (12/3) + (15/12)

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 12 is 12. So, we rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 12:

Resultant height = (4/1) + (15/12)

Now, we can add the fractions:

Resultant height = (4*12)/12 + (15/12)
Resultant height = (48/12) + (15/12)
Resultant height = (48+15)/12
Resultant height = 63/12

The resultant height of the cloud from the ground is 63/12 kms.

The painter used 18/11 + 1/8 liters of paint in total.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 11 and 8 is 88.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
18/11 = (18*8)/(11*8) = 144/88
1/8 = 1/8
Now, we can add the fractions:
144/88 + 1/8 = 145/88
The painter used 145/88 liters of paint in total.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total amount of gold, we need to add the amount of gold in each pot.
The first pot contains 12/13 pounds of gold, and the second pot contains 3/2 pounds of gold.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 2 is 26.
So, we can rewrite the fractions as 20/26 and 33/26.
Now, we can add the fractions: 20/26 + 33/26 = 53/26.
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.
So, the fraction simplifies to 53/26.
Therefore, there is a total of 53/26 pounds of gold in the pots.

There are 10 ducks distributed among 5 ponds, so each pond has 10 / 5 = &lt;&lt;10/5=2&gt;&gt;2 ducks.
There are 8 fish distributed among 10 small pools, so each pool has 8 / 10 = &lt;&lt;8/10=0.8&gt;&gt;0.8 fish.
Since each pool has 0.8 fish, there are 0.8 * 10 = &lt;&lt;0.8*10=8&gt;&gt;8 fish in total in the pools.
In total, there are 2 ducks per pond * 5 ponds = &lt;&lt;2*5=10&gt;&gt;10 ducks in the ponds.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 18 and 6 is 18. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 18:

Soap B: 4/6 = 8/18

Total soap produced = (13/18) + (8/18) = (13+8)/18 = 21/18

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

21 ï¿½ 3 = 7
18 ï¿½ 3 = 6

So, the total soap produced each day is 7/6 tons. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a ton, we need to convert this to a mixed number:

7/6 = 1 1/6 tons

Therefore, the soap company produces 1 1/6 tons of soap in total each day.</pre>

            Originally, Mark bought a sleeping bag that was 8/2 feet long instead of 19/2 feet. He still cuts off 13/12 feet from it to fit his height. How long is his sleeping bag now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Mark's sleeping bag was initially 8/2 feet long.
He cut off 13/12 feet from it.
To find the length of the sleeping bag now, we subtract the length he cut off from the initial length.
The length of the sleeping bag now is 8/2 - 13/12 feet.
To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 2 and 12 is 12.
So, we rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 12:
8/2 = (8*6)/(2*6) = 48/12
13/12
Now we can subtract the fractions:
48/12 - 13/12 = 35/12
So, Mark's sleeping bag is now 35/12 feet long.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total weight of the gold Captain Hook now has, we need to add the weight of the gold he initially had to the weight of the gold he found on his latest treasure hunt.

Captain Hook initially had 11/8 ounces of gold.
He found an additional 5/5 ounces of gold on his latest treasure hunt.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 5 is 40. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 40:

11/8 = 55/40
5/5 = 40/40

Now, we can add the fractions:

55/40 + 40/40 = 95/40

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

95/40 = 19/8

So, the total weight of the gold Captain Hook now has is 19/8 ounces.

To find the total weight of all the gold Captain Hook now has, we need to add the weight of the gold he initially had, the weight of the gold he found on his latest treasure hunt, and the weight of the gold he found in the small pouch.

Captain Hook initially had 11/8 ounces of gold.
He found an additional 5/5 ounces of gold on his latest treasure hunt.
He found an additional 7/11 ounces of gold in the small pouch.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8, 40, and 11 is 440. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 440:

11/8 = 575/440
5/5 = 440/440
7/11 = 308/440

Now, we can add the fractions:

575/440 + 440/440 + 308/440 = 1323/440

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

1323/440 = 1323/440

So, the total weight of all the gold Captain Hook now has is 1323/440 ounces.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Bob's jacket originally measured 14/3 meters.
He cut off 14/16 meters from the original length.
To find the length of the jacket after the alteration, we need to subtract the length cut off from the original length.

Length of jacket after alteration = Original length - Length cut off
Length of jacket after alteration = (14/3) - (14/16)

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 16 is 48. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 48:

(14/3) = (14 * 16) / (3 * 16) = (224/48)
(14/16) = (14 * 3) / (16 * 3) = (42/48)

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

Length of jacket after alteration = (224/48) - (42/48) = (224 - 42) / 48 = 182/48

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

Length of jacket after alteration = (182/2) / (48/2) = 91/24

So, the length of Bob's jacket after the alteration is 91/24 meters.</pre>

To find the total time it takes for Mr. Carpenter to build a chair, we need to add the time it takes to build the frame and the time it takes to upholster it.

The time it takes to build the frame is 5/3 hours.
The time it takes to upholster it is 10/13 hours.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 13 is 39. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 39:

5/3 = (5 * 13) / (3 * 13) = 65/39
10/13 = (10 * 3) / (13 * 3) = 30/39

Now, we can add the fractions:

65/39 + 30/39 = 95/39

So, it takes Mr. Carpenter 95/39 hours to build a chair from start to finish.

To express this as a mixed number, we divide the numerator by the denominator:

95 ï¿½ 39 = 2 remainder 13

So, the mixed number is 2 13/39.

To find the total amount of fabric Johnathan needs, we need to add the amount of fabric needed for the sleeping bag and the liner.

The amount of fabric needed for the sleeping bag is 12/14 yards.
The amount of fabric needed for the liner is 8/5 yards.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 14 and 5 is 70.

So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 70:

12/14 = (12 * 5) / (14 * 5) = 60/70
8/5 = (8 * 14) / (5 * 14) = 112/70

Now, we can add the fractions:

60/70 + 112/70 = 172/70

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

17 = 17 * 1 = 17/1
86/35 = 86/35

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

17/1 - 86/35 = (17 * 35) / (1 * 35) - 86/35 = 595/35 - 86/35 = 509/35

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

509/35 = 509/35

So, Johnathan has 509/35 yards of fabric left after using the necessary fabric to create his sleeping bag.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous problem, Johnathan originally thought he needed 12/14 yards of one fabric to create the sleeping bag. But after rechecking his measurements, he realized he only needed 12/17 yards of that fabric. The liner fabric remained the same at 8/5 yards. How many total yards of fabric does he actually need to make the sleeping bag?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total amount of fabric Johnathan actually needs, we need to add the amount of fabric needed for the sleeping bag and the liner.

The amount of fabric needed for the sleeping bag is 12/17 yards.
The amount of fabric needed for the liner is 8/5 yards.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 17 and 5 is 85.

So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 85:

12/17 = (12 * 5) / (17 * 5) = 60/85
8/5 = (8 * 17) / (5 * 17) = 136/85

Now, we can add the fractions:

60/85 + 136/85 = 196/85

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1:

196/85 = 196/85

So, Johnathan actually needs a total of 196/85 yards of fabric to make the sleeping bag.

To find the total acreage of pine and oak trees in the forest, we need to add the acreage of pine trees and the acreage of oak trees.
The total acreage of pine trees is 5/4 acres.
The total acreage of oak trees is 1/2 acre.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4.

To find the total amount of ingredients used, we need to add the amount of moon roots and stardust together.

Moon roots: 18/8 ounces
Stardust: 11/7 ounces

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 7 is 56. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 56:

Moon roots: 18/8 = 27/14
Stardust: 11/7 = 88/56

Now, we can add the fractions:

Total ingredients = (27/14) + (88/56)

To add the fractions, we add the numerators and keep the denominator:

Total ingredients = (27 + 88) / 56 = 115/56

The wizard used 115/56 ounces of ingredients in total to prepare the potion.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The tree grows 1/10 of its height every month. This month, it additionally has grown 12/6 feet due to a fertilizer being applied.
Let's assume the tree's height is H.
The tree grows 1/10 * H every month.
This month, the tree has grown 12/6 feet.
So, the total growth this month is 1/10 * H + 12/6.
To find the total growth this month, we need to find the value of H.
We can set up the equation as follows:
1/10 * H + 12/6 = Total growth this month
To solve for H, we need to find a common denominator for 1/10 and 12/6, which is 60.
1/10 * H + 12/6 = Total growth this month
(6/60) * H + (12/6) = Total growth this month
(6/60) * H + 20 = Total growth this month
To isolate H, we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
(6/60) * H + 20 - 20 = Total growth this month - 20
(6/60) * H = Total growth this month - 20
To solve for H, we multiply both sides of the equation by 60/6:
(6/60) * H * (60/6) = (Total growth this month - 20) * (60/6)
H = (Total growth this month - 20) * 10
H = (12/6 - 20) * 10
H = (-8/6) * 10
H = -40/3
The value of H is -40/3.
Since the height of a tree cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement or the given information.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total area occupied by both tents, we need to add the area of the large tent to the area of the smaller tent.

The area of the large tent is 13/11 acres.
The area of the smaller tent is 8/20 acres.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 11 and 20 is 220. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 220:

Large tent area: (13/11) * (20/20) = 260/220 acres
Smaller tent area: (8/20) * (11/11) = 88/220 acres

Now, we can add the two fractions:

Total area = (260/220) + (88/220) = (260 + 88) / 220 = 348/220

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4:

Total area = (348/4) / (220/4) = 87/55 acres

So, the total area occupied by both tents is 87/55 acres.</pre>

To find the total distance, we need to add the distances traveled in the East and North directions.
The distance traveled to the East is (17 / 20) km.
The distance traveled to the North is (15 / 3) km.
So, the total distance traveled is (17 / 20) + (15 / 3) km.

Calculating the total distance:
(17 / 20) + (15 / 3) = (17 / 20) + (15 / 3) * (20 / 20) = (17 / 20) + (300 / 60) = (17 / 20) + (5 / 1) = (17 / 20) + (5 * 20 / 20) = (17 / 20) + (100 / 20) = (17 + 100) / 20 = 117 / 20 km.

To find the total amount of firewood collected, we need to add the amount collected by Sarah and Alex.

First, we need to convert 11/20 to a fraction with a common denominator of 70 (the least common multiple of 20 and 7).

11/20 = (11*7)/(20*7) = 77/140

Now, we can add the fractions:

77/140 + 9/7 = (77+126)/140 = 203/140

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7:

203/140 = (203/7)/(140/7) = 29/20

So, Sarah and Alex collected a total of 29/20 pounds of firewood.

To find the total weight of the two types of meat per sandwich, we need to add the weight of the ham and the weight of the turkey.

The weight of the ham is 19/17 pounds and the weight of the turkey is 9/4 pounds.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 17 and 4 is 68.

So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

19/17 = (19 * 4) / (17 * 4) = 76/68
9/4 = (9 * 17) / (4 * 17) = 153/68

Now, we can add the fractions:

76/68 + 153/68 = 229/68

So, the total weight of the two types of meat per sandwich is 229/68 pounds.

            After making their signature sandwich, the restaurant staff find that they have used 13/9 pounds more meat than they intended to. What is the weight of the meat that should have been in the sandwich?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's assume the intended weight of the meat in the sandwich is x pounds.

According to the problem, the actual weight of the meat used is x + 13/9 pounds.

We know that the actual weight of the meat used is 229/68 pounds (from the previous problem).

So, we can set up the equation:

x + 13/9 = 229/68

To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator for 9 and 68, which is 68.

Multiply both sides of the equation by 68:

68x + 884/9 = 229

Now, we can subtract 884/9 from both sides:

68x = 229 - 884/9

To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 68 is 540.

So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

229 = (229 * 9) / (68 * 9) = 2061/540
884/9 = (884 * 60) / (9 * 60) = 52960/540

Now, we can subtract the fractions:

2061/540 - 52960/540 = -50909/540

So, the equation becomes:

68x = -50909/540

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 68:

x = (-50909/540) / 68

To divide the fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction:

x = (-50909/540) * (1/68)

x = -50909/3696

So, the weight of the meat that should have been in the sandwich is -50909/3696 pounds.

To find the total amount of water in the container, we need to add the amount of water Sarah poured initially and the amount she added later.

Initial amount of water = 10/13 gallons

Initial amount of water = (10/13) * (2/2) = 20/26 gallons
Amount of water added later = (8/2) * (13/13) = 104/26 gallons

Now, we can add the fractions:

Total amount of water = (20/26) + (104/26) = (20 + 104)/26 = 124/26 = 21/5 = 4.2 gallons

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total time it rained is the sum of the time of the first rainfall and the time of the second rainfall.
The first rainfall lasted for 4/13 hours, and the second rainfall lasted for 11/5 hours.
So, the total time it rained is 4/13 + 11/5 hours.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 5.
The LCM of 13 and 5 is 65.
So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 65:
4/13 = (4 * 5) / 65 = 20/65
11/5 = (11 * 13) / 65 = 143/65
Now, we can add the fractions:
20/65 + 143/65 = 163/65
To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 163 and 65 is 1.
So, the simplified fraction is 163/65.
Therefore, it rained for a total of 163/65 hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total time it rained over the course of these two days is the sum of the time of the first rainfall, the time of the second rainfall, and the time of the third rainfall.
The first rainfall lasted for 4/13 hours, the second rainfall lasted for 11/5 hours, and the third rainfall lasted for 11/19 hours.
So, the total time it rained is 4/13 + 11/5 + 11/19 hours.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of 13, 5, and 19.
The LCM of 13, 5, and 19 is 209.
So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 209:
4/13 = (4 * 16) / 209 = 64/209
11/5 = (11 * 41) / 209 = 451/209
11/19 = (11 * 11) / 209 = 121/209
Now, we can add the fractions:
64/209 + 451/209 + 121/209 = 636/209
To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 636 and 209 is 1.
So, the simplified fraction is 636/209.
Therefore, it rained for a total of 636/209 hours over the course of these two days.

Jane cuts 10/12 yards of fabric from a blanket.
Then, she cuts an additional 10/10 yard.
To find the total amount of fabric cut, we need to add the two fractions.
The denominators of the fractions are 12 and 10, so we need to find a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 12 and 10 is 60.
So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 60:
10/12 = 50/60
10/10 = 60/60
Now, we can add the fractions:
50/60 + 60/60 = 110/60
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:
110/60 = 11/6
So, Jane has cut a total of 11/6 yards of fabric from the blanket.

Jane cuts 10/12 yards of fabric from a blanket.
Then, she cuts an additional 10/10 yard.
To find the total amount of fabric cut, we need to add the two fractions.
The denominators of the fractions are 12 and 10, so we need to find a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 12 and 10 is 60.
So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 60:
10/12 = 50/60
10/10 = 60/60
Now, we can add the fractions:
50/60 + 60/60 = 110/60
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 10:
110/60 = 11/6
So, Jane has cut a total of 11/6 yards of fabric from the blanket.

Now, Jane decides to cut an additional 4/12 yard.
To find the total amount of fabric cut, we need to add the two fractions.
The denominators of the fractions are 6 and 12, so we need to find a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 6 and 12 is 12.
So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 12:
11/6 = 66/12
4/12 = 4/12
Now, we can add the fractions:
66/12 + 4/12 = 70/12
To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
70/12 = 35/6
So, Jane has cut a total of 35/6 yards of fabric from the blanket.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
If you use 1 vowel, you will get 3/11 of a point.
If you use 1 consonant, you will get 8/10 of a point.
To find the total score, we need to add the scores for the vowel and the consonant.

Calculating the score:
Score for the vowel = 3/11
Score for the consonant = 8/10
Total score = Score for the vowel + Score for the consonant
Total score = 3/11 + 8/10

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 11 and 10 is 110. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 110:

3/11 = 30/110
8/10 = 88/110

Now, we can add the fractions:
Total score = 30/110 + 88/110
Total score = 118/110

To simplify the fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
Total score = 59/55

So, your score will be 59/55 points.</pre>

To find the total number of kilograms of apples in the store, we need to add the weight of the red apples and the weight of the green apples.

The weight of the red apples is 17/20 kg.
The weight of the green apples is 18/8 kg.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 20 and 8 is 40. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 40:

17/20 = 85/100
18/8 = 72/40 = 36/20 = 180/100

Now, we can add the fractions:

85/100 + 180/100 = 265/100

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

265/100 ï¿½ 5/5 = 53/20

The drummer hits the first beat every 17/17 seconds, which is equivalent to 1 second.
The drummer hits the second beat every 2/12 seconds, which is equivalent to 1/6 seconds.
To find the total time it takes for the drummer to hit the two beats together, we add the time for each beat.

1 second (first beat) + 1/6 seconds (second beat) = 1 + 1/6 = 6/6 + 1/6 = 7/6 seconds.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total cord of wood burned in a day, we need to add the amount burned in the morning and the amount burned in the evening.

The total cord of wood burned in a day is 12/17 + 8/19.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 17 and 19 is 323.

So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

12/17 = (12 * 19) / (17 * 19) = 228/323
8/19 = (8 * 17) / (19 * 17) = 136/323

Now, we can add the fractions:

(228/323) + (136/323) = 364/323

So, the total cord of wood burned in a day is 364/323.

To find the total cord of wood burned in one full day, we need to add the amount burned in the morning, the amount burned in the evening, and the additional amount burned at night.

The total cord of wood burned in one full day is (12/17 + 8/19 + 19/20).

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 17, 19, and 20 is 3230.

So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

12/17 = (12 * 190) / (17 * 190) = 2280/3230
8/19 = (8 * 170) / (19 * 170) = 1360/3230
19/20 = (19 * 1615) / (20 * 1615) = 3045/3230

Now, we can add the fractions:

(2280/3230) + (1360/3230) + (3045/3230) = 6685/3230

To find the total distance the butterfly has flown, we need to add the additional distance to the total distance of the first two segments.
The first two segments were 18/19 + 9/17 = 477/323 miles long.
The additional distance is 19/20 of a mile.
To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 323 and 20 is 6460.
So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:
477/323 = (477*20)/(323*20) = 9540/6460
19/20 = (19*323)/(20*323) = 6137/6460
Now, we can add the fractions:

            A colonial fireplace burns firewood at a rate of 4/15 cords per hour in the early morning. In the late night, the rate increases to 14/15 cords per hour. How much firewood does the fireplace burn in total in one hour split between the early morning and late night?

            If Bob has 10/2 of a cucumber and he adds it to 1/7 of another cucumber, how many cucumbers does he have in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Bob has 10/2 = &lt;&lt;10/2=5&gt;&gt;5 cucumbers.
He adds 1/7 of another cucumber, which is 1/7 = &lt;&lt;1/7=0.14285714285714285&gt;&gt;0.14285714285714285 of a cucumber.
So, Bob has 5 + 0.14285714285714285 = &lt;&lt;5+0.14285714285714285=5.142857142857143&gt;&gt;5.142857142857143 cucumbers in total.
