        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions (1/8) and (4/1), we need to find a common denominator. The common denominator for 8 and 1 is 8.

So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(1/8) = (1 * 1)/(8 * 1) = (1/8)
(4/1) = (4 * 8)/(1 * 8) = (32/8)

Now, we can compare the fractions:

(1/8) _ (32/8)

Since the denominators are the same, we can compare the numerators:

1 _ 32

Since 1 is less than 32, we can conclude that:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To compare the two fractions, we can simplify them and then compare their values.

The first fraction, 9/3, can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.
9 ï¿½ 3 = 3
3 ï¿½ 3 = 1
So, 9/3 simplifies to 3/1.

The second fraction, 7/1, cannot be simplified any further.

Now, we can compare the two simplified fractions:

3/1 _ 7/1

Since the denominators are the same, we can compare the numerators.

3 _ 7

Since 3 is less than 7, we can conclude that 3/1 is less than 7/1.

Therefore, the answer is &lt;.

To compare the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 10 is 70. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a common denominator of 70:

(3 / 7) = (3 * 10) / (7 * 10) = 30 / 70
(9 / 10) = 9 / 10

Now, we can compare the fractions:

30 / 70 _ 9 / 10

Since 30 is less than 9, the fraction 30 / 70 is less than 9 / 10.

### Answer: &lt;

The comparison is different than the comparison between 3 / 2 and 9 / 10. In the previous problem, the fraction with the larger numerator (15 / 10) was greater than the fraction with the smaller numerator (9 / 10). In this problem, the fraction with the smaller numerator (30 / 70) is less than the fraction with the larger numerator (9 / 10). The impact of decreasing the numerator of our first fraction (from 15 to 30) has changed the comparison.</pre>

            Compare the two fractions by filling in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =. 
In the last example, you were comparing the fractions 2 / 1 and 6 / 5. 
Now consider how the result might change when you compare these fractions:
(2 / 2) _ (6 / 5)

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the two fractions, we can multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.

(2 / 2) * (5 / 6) = 5 / 6

Since 5/6 is less than 1, we can conclude that (2 / 2) &lt; (6 / 5).

To compare the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 45.

(7 / 5) = (7 * 9) / (5 * 9) = 63 / 45
(9 / 9) = (9 * 5) / (9 * 5) = 45 / 45

Now we can compare the fractions:

Since 63 is greater than 45, the fraction (7 / 5) is greater than (9 / 9).

To compare the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 50.

(7 / 5) = (7 * 10) / (5 * 10) = 70 / 50
(9 / 10) = (9 * 5) / (10 * 5) = 45 / 50

To compare the fractions (3/7) and (5/8), we can find a common denominator and then compare the numerators.

The least common multiple of 7 and 8 is 56. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 56:

(3/7) = (3 * 8) / (7 * 8) = 24 / 56
(5/8) = (5 * 7) / (8 * 7) = 35 / 56

Now, we can compare the numerators:

24 &lt; 35

So, (3/7) &lt; (5/8).

To compare the fractions, we can simplify them to have the same denominator. In this case, the denominators are already the same (10). So, we can compare the numerators directly.

9 (numerator of the first fraction) &gt; 3 (numerator of the second fraction)

Therefore, (9 / 10) &gt; (3 / 10)

To compare the fractions, we need to have the same denominator. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which in this case is 20. Now, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(9 / 4) = (9 * 5) / (4 * 5) = 45 / 20
(3 / 10) = (3 * 2) / (10 * 2) = 6 / 20

Now, we can compare the numerators:

First, let's find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple of 7 and 3 is 21.

Now, let's rewrite both fractions with the common denominator of 21:

(3 / 7) = (3 * 3) / (7 * 3) = 9 / 21
(5 / 3) = (5 * 7) / (3 * 7) = 35 / 21

Now, we can compare the two fractions:

9 / 21 _ 35 / 21

Since 9 is less than 35, the first fraction is less than the second fraction.

Therefore, the answer is:

Both fractions have the same denominator, which is 9. To compare the fractions, we need to compare the numerators. The numerator of the first fraction is 9, and the numerator of the second fraction is 2. Since 9 is greater than 2, the first fraction is greater than the second fraction.

To compare the two fractions, we need to have a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 4.

(6 / 1) = (6 * 4) / (1 * 4) = 24 / 4
(4 / 4) = 4 / 4

Now we can compare the two fractions:

(24 / 4) _ (4 / 4)

Since 24 is greater than 4, the relationship between the two fractions is:

(24 / 4) &gt; (4 / 4)

To compare the two fractions, we need to have a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 3.

(6 / 1) = (6 * 3) / (1 * 3) = 18 / 3
(4 / 3) = 4 / 3

Since 18 is greater than 4, the relationship between the two fractions is:

### Answer: &gt;

Comparing the results of the two scenarios, we can see that in both cases, the relationship between the fractions is &gt;. This means that the fraction (6 / 1) is greater than both (4 / 4) and (4 / 3).</pre>

To compare the two fractions, we need to determine if they are equal, if the first fraction is greater than the second, or if the second fraction is greater than the first.

The first fraction is 9/9, which simplifies to 1.
The second fraction is 9/10.

Since 1 is greater than 9/10, we can conclude that the first fraction is greater than the second.

Therefore, the correct comparison is:

To compare the two fractions, we can simplify them first.
The first fraction, 8/4, can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4. This gives us 2/1, which is equal to 2.
The second fraction, 5/2, cannot be simplified any further.
Now, we can compare the two fractions. Since 2 is less than 5, the first fraction is less than the second fraction.

To compare the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 9.

Now, let's compare the numerators:
8 (numerator of the first fraction) &gt; 7 (numerator of the second fraction)

Since the numerator of the first fraction is greater than the numerator of the second fraction, the first fraction is greater.

However, we also need to consider the denominators. In this case, the denominator of the first fraction (9) is greater than the denominator of the second fraction (3).

When the denominator is greater, the fraction is smaller. So, we need to compare the fractions with the same denominator.

Let's rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 9:
(8 / 9) = (8 / 9)
(7 / 3) = (21 / 9)

Now, let's compare the numerators:
8 (numerator of the first fraction) &lt; 21 (numerator of the second fraction)

Since the numerator of the first fraction is less than the numerator of the second fraction, the first fraction is less.

Therefore, (8 / 9) &lt; (7 / 3)

To compare the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 4.

(5 / 4) = (5 * 1) / (4 * 1) = 5 / 4
(2 / 4) = (2 * 1) / (4 * 1) = 2 / 4

        <pre class="model-raw-response">The fraction (5 / 1) is greater than the fraction (5 / 8).

Reasoning:
When comparing fractions, we can compare them by finding a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 8.

(5 / 1) = (5 * 8) / (1 * 8) = 40 / 8
(5 / 8) = 5 / 8

Now we can compare the fractions:

40 / 8 &gt; 5 / 8

So, (5 / 1) &gt; (5 / 8)</pre>

First, let's simplify the fractions:

6/5 = 1.2
9/6 = 1.5

Now, let's compare the two values:

1.2 &lt; 1.5

So, the correct symbol to use in the statement is &quot;&lt;&quot;.

To compare the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 1 is 8. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 8:

(10 / 8) = (10 * 1) / (8 * 1) = 10 / 8

Now, we can compare the two fractions:

The fractions (10 / 10) and (4 / 9) can be compared by comparing their numerators.
The numerator of the first fraction is 10, and the numerator of the second fraction is 4.
Since 10 is greater than 4, the first fraction is greater than the second fraction.
However, the denominators are different, so we need to compare the fractions with a common denominator.
The least common multiple of 10 and 9 is 90, so we can rewrite the fractions with a common denominator of 90:
(10 / 10) = (10 * 9) / (10 * 10) = 90 / 100
(4 / 9) = (4 * 10) / (9 * 10) = 40 / 90
Now we can compare the numerators:
90 &gt; 40
Therefore, (10 / 10) &gt; (4 / 9).

To compare the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 7 and 6 is 42. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

(10 / 7) = (10 * 6) / (7 * 6) = 60 / 42
(9 / 6) = (9 * 7) / (6 * 7) = 63 / 42

Now, we can compare the fractions:

60 / 42 &lt; 63 / 42

### Answer: &gt;

However, to compare the original fraction (6 / 7) to the new fraction (5 / 7), we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 7:

(6 / 7) = 6 / 7
(5 / 7) = 5 / 7

Now, we can compare the two fractions:

6 / 7 _ 5 / 7

Since 6 is greater than 5, the fraction 6 / 7 is greater than the fraction 5 / 7.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the fractions (2/6) and (8/7), we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 7 is 42, so we can rewrite the fractions as follows:

(2/6) = (2 \* 7) / (6 \* 7) = 14 / 42
(8/7) = (8 \* 6) / (7 \* 6) = 48 / 42

Now we can compare the fractions:

To compare the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 1 is 8. So, we can rewrite the fractions with the common denominator of 8:

(6 / 8) = (6 * 1 / 8 * 1) = (6 / 8)
(5 / 1) = (5 * 8 / 1 * 8) = (40 / 8)

Now, we can compare the fractions:

(6 / 8) _ (40 / 8)

Since 6 &lt; 40, we can conclude that:

(6 / 8) &lt; (40 / 8)
