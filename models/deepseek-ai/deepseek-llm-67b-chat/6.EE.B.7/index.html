        A certain breed of mouse has a metabolic rate such that it needs to consume 104 food units every day. If a group of these mice require 7592 units of food for one day, how many mice are there in the group?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
If one mouse needs 104 food units every day, then the number of mice in the group can be found by dividing the total food units by the food units required by one mouse.

Let's denote the number of mice in the group as x.

We can set up the equation as follows:

104 * x = 7592

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 7592 / 104
x = 73

So, there are 73 mice in the group.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
There are 311 kids in total, and 159 of them are playing on the jungle gym.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The speed of the UFO can be calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.

Speed = Distance / Time

In this case, the distance traveled is 3660 kilometers and the time taken is 60 minutes.

        There are 5536 bars in total to construct a large jungle gym. If each section of the jungle gym requires 16 bars, how many sections can be constructed?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many sections can be constructed, we need to divide the total number of bars by the number of bars required for each section.

Total number of bars = 5536
Number of bars required for each section = 16

Number of sections = Total number of bars / Number of bars required for each section
Number of sections = 5536 / 16

Calculating the result:
Number of sections = 346

So, 346 sections can be constructed.</pre>

        If a farmer stored some apples and the total count became 348 after adding another 219 apples, how many apples did the farmer initially have?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's assume the initial number of apples the farmer had is x.
After adding 219 apples, the total count became 348.
So, x + 219 = 348.

To find the initial number of apples, we need to subtract 219 from both sides of the equation:
x = 348 - 219.

Solving for x, we get:
x = 129.

Therefore, the farmer initially had 129 apples.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many kWh each kph of wind speed generates, we need to divide the total kWh generated by the wind speed.

Let's first find out how many kWh are generated per hour. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the turbine generates 8640 kWh / 24 hours = 360 kWh per hour.

Now, let's find out how many kWh are generated per kph. Since the wind speed is steady at 45 kph, we can divide the kWh generated per hour by the wind speed: 360 kWh / 45 kph = 8 kWh per kph.

So, each kph of wind speed generates 8 kWh.

        A crayon factory is running a special production line that produces 5040 crayons in one day by operating for 't' hours. If the factory machine can produce 45 crayons every hour, for how many hours was the machine operating?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The factory machine produces 45 crayons every hour.
In one day, the machine produces 5040 crayons.
To find out how many hours the machine was operating, we can divide the total number of crayons produced by the number of crayons produced per hour.

t = 5040 / 45

Calculating the value of t:
t = 112

The machine was operating for 112 hours.

        A city received 750 millimeters of rainfall during the monsoon season. If, in the first half of the season, there were 359 millimeters of rainfall, how much rainfall did the city receive in the second half of the season?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total rainfall for the monsoon season is 750 millimeters.
The rainfall in the first half of the season is 359 millimeters.
To find the rainfall in the second half of the season, subtract the rainfall in the first half from the total rainfall.
750 - 359 = 391 millimeters

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The weight of the air inside the balloon is the difference between the weight of the fully inflated balloon and the weight of the balloon itself.
Weight of air inside the balloon = Weight of fully inflated balloon - Weight of balloon
Weight of air inside the balloon = 573 grams - 254 grams
Weight of air inside the balloon = 319 grams
The weight of the air inside the balloon is 319 grams.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's assume the amount of yellow paint used is y liters.
The total amount of green paint is the sum of blue and yellow paint, which is 8 + y liters.
We know that the total amount of green paint is 280 liters.
So, we can write the equation as:
8 + y = 280
Solving for y, we get:
y = 280 - 8
y = 272
Therefore, you used 272 liters of yellow paint.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
There are 264 total rooms in the castle.
234 of those rooms are occupied.
To find the number of unoccupied rooms, we subtract the number of occupied rooms from the total number of rooms.
So, 264 - 234 = &lt;&lt;264-234=30&gt;&gt;30 rooms are unoccupied.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
There are 326 beach balls in total.
One part of the beach already has 246 beach balls.
To find out how many beach balls are in the other part, we need to subtract the number of beach balls in the first part from the total number of beach balls.
So, 326 - 246 = &lt;&lt;326-246=80&gt;&gt;80 beach balls are in the other part.

        There are 9287 passengers that took the bus this week. If each bus can carry 251 passengers, how many buses were needed to carry all the passengers?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many buses were needed to carry all the passengers, we need to divide the total number of passengers by the number of passengers each bus can carry.

Number of buses = Total number of passengers / Number of passengers each bus can carry

Number of buses = 9287 / 251

Number of buses = 37

So, 37 buses were needed to carry all the passengers.

        Superhero Flash can run 198 miles in an hour. If the total miles he can run is increased by 19 miles per hour compared to his previous speed, what was his previous speed?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's assume the previous speed of Superhero Flash is x miles per hour.
According to the given information, his new speed is x + 19 miles per hour.
We know that the new speed is 198 miles per hour.
So, we can set up the equation as follows:
x + 19 = 198
Now, we can solve for x:
x = 198 - 19
x = 179
Therefore, the previous speed of Superhero Flash was 179 miles per hour.
