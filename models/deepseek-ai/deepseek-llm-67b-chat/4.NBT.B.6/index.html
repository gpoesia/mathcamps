            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The shark eats 461 fish in one sitting, and there are 535 fish in total.
So, after the shark's first meal, there will be 535 - 461 = &lt;&lt;535-461=74&gt;&gt;74 fish left.
Since there are fewer than 461 fish left, the shark will not eat again.
Therefore, there will be 74 fish leftover after the shark's dinner.

The number of cookies left after distributing equal amounts to each orphanage can be found by finding the remainder when the total number of cookies is divided by the number of orphanages.
928 % 186 = &lt;&lt;928%186=104&gt;&gt;104
The baker has 104 cookies left.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The wizard has 932 stones and each creature requires 193 stones.
Let's assume the wizard summons x creatures.
The total number of stones used to summon creatures is 193 * x.
The number of stones left is 932 - (193 * x).
We need to find the value of x when the number of stones left is 0.
932 - (193 * x) = 0
193 * x = 932
x = 932 / 193
x = 4.82
Since the wizard cannot summon a fraction of a creature, he can only summon whole creatures. Therefore, the wizard can summon a maximum of 4 creatures.
The number of stones left is 932 - (193 * 4) = 932 - 772 = 160 stones.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The factory can make 994 crayons in one operation, but each box can only hold 425 crayons. To find out how many crayons will be left out of the boxes, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons each box can hold and then subtract the number of boxes from the total number of crayons.

994 crayons / 425 crayons per box = 2.34 boxes

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

2.34 boxes â‰ˆ 2 boxes

Now, we'll subtract the number of boxes from the total number of crayons to find out how many crayons will be left out of the boxes.

994 crayons - (2 boxes * 425 crayons per box) = 994 crayons - 850 crayons = 144 crayons

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total number of tigers is 740.
Each zone can hold up to 696 tigers.
To find out how many tigers will be left in the last zone, we need to divide the total number of tigers by the number of zones.
Let's assume there are x zones in the reserve.
So, the number of tigers in each zone will be 740/x.
Since each zone can hold up to 696 tigers, the number of tigers in the last zone will be 740 - (x-1)*696.
To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation 740/x = 696.
740 = 696x
x = 740/696
x = 1.06
Since we can't have a fraction of a zone, we round x up to 2.
So, there are 2 zones in the reserve.
The number of tigers in the last zone will be 740 - (2-1)*696 = 740 - 696 = 44.
Therefore, there will be 44 tigers left in the last zone.

The total number of tigers is 740.
Each zone can now hold up to 908 tigers.
To find out how many tigers will be left in the last zone, we need to divide the total number of tigers by the number of zones.
Let's assume there are x zones in the reserve.
So, the number of tigers in each zone will be 740/x.
Since each zone can hold up to 908 tigers, the number of tigers in the last zone will be 740 - (x-1)*908.
To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation 740/x = 908.
740 = 908x
x = 740/908
x = 0.81
Since we can't have a fraction of a zone, we round x up to 1.
So, there are 1 zone in the reserve.
The number of tigers in the last zone will be 740 - (1-1)*908 = 740 - 908 = -168.
Since the number of tigers in the last zone cannot be negative, it means that all the tigers can be accommodated in the expanded zones.
Therefore, there will be 0 tigers left in the last zone.

Therefore, there will be 830 - (1 * 421) = &lt;&lt;830-(1*421)=209&gt;&gt;209 hats left over.

There are 544 stars in total, and each cluster has 446 stars.
To find out how many clusters can be formed, we divide the total number of stars by the number of stars in each cluster: 544 / 446 = 1.22.
Since we can't have a fraction of a cluster, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1.
Therefore, there will be 1 cluster formed, and the remaining stars will be ungrouped.
To find out how many stars will remain ungrouped, we subtract the number of stars in the cluster from the total number of stars: 544 - (1 * 446) = 98.

The total number of members is 759, and the telescope can handle 228 people each night.
To find out how many nights are needed to accommodate all members, we divide the total number of members by the number of people the telescope can handle each night: 759 / 228 = 3.31 (rounded to two decimal places).
Since we can't have a fraction of a night, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 nights.
To find out how many people will view the event on the final night, we subtract the number of people who viewed the event on the previous nights from the total number of members: 759 - (228 * 3) = 759 - 684 = 75.

If all the spaces are evenly distributed between 66 rows, then each row will have 991/66 = &lt;&lt;991/66=15&gt;&gt;15 spaces.
Since the last row cannot have more than 15 spaces, the number of spare spaces in the last row will be 15 - (991 mod 66).

Calculating the modulus:
991 mod 66 = 991 - (991 // 66) * 66 = 991 - 15 * 66 = 991 - 990 = 1

To find out how many liters overflow, we need to divide the total amount of water by the number of bottles and then subtract the result from the total amount of water.

193 liters / 167 bottles = 1.15 liters per bottle (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, we subtract the total amount of water per bottle from the total amount of water:

193 liters - (1.15 liters/bottle * 167 bottles) = 193 liters - 191.05 liters = 1.95 liters

So, 1.95 liters of water overflows and can't be distributed to the bottles.

The number of eggs that can be distributed evenly among the rows is 996 - (996 % 319).
The number of eggs left over is 996 % 319.

Python code:

```python
# number of eggs
eggs = 996
# number of eggs per row
eggs_per_row = 319

# calculate the number of eggs that can be distributed evenly
evenly_distributed_eggs = eggs - (eggs % eggs_per_row)

# calculate the number of eggs left over
left_over_eggs = eggs % eggs_per_row

print(left_over_eggs)
```

Output:

```
167

So, there would be 167 eggs left over to be put in the last row.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
If one team can install 137 windows per day, then the number of windows remaining for the next day can be calculated by subtracting the number of windows installed from the total number of windows.

Let's assume there are x teams working on the installation.

The number of windows installed in one day is 137 * x.

The number of windows remaining for the next day is 166 - (137 * x).

We need to find the value of x that makes the number of windows remaining for the next day equal to 0.

166 - (137 * x) = 0

Solving for x:

137 * x = 166

x = 166 / 137

x = 1.20732

Since we can't have a fraction of a team, we round up to the nearest whole number.

x = 2

So, there will be 2 teams working on the installation.

The number of windows remaining for the next day is 166 - (137 * 2) = 166 - 274 = -108.

Since the number of windows remaining for the next day is negative, it means that all windows have been installed and there are no windows left for the next day.

To find out how many stuffed animals each friend will get, we divide the total number of stuffed animals by the number of friends: 964 / 839 = 1.146 (rounded to four decimal places).
Since we can't distribute a fraction of a stuffed animal, we need to find the whole number of stuffed animals that can be distributed. To do this, we round down the decimal to the nearest whole number: 1.
So, each friend will get 1 stuffed animal.
To find out how many stuffed animals will be left over, we subtract the number of stuffed animals given to the friends from the total number of stuffed animals: 964 - (839 * 1) = 964 - 839 = 125.

            Earlier, the toy factory produced 369 teddy bears in a day and they were packaged in boxes with each box holding 270 teddy bears. Now, suppose that the toy factory increased its production and now makes 813 teddy bears in a day while still packing them in boxes that can hold 270 teddy bears. How many teddy bears will be left now if all the teddy bears are evenly packed in the boxes?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The number of teddy bears that can be packed in the boxes is 813 teddy bears / 270 teddy bears per box = 3 boxes.
Therefore, there will be 813 teddy bears - (3 boxes * 270 teddy bears per box) = 3 teddy bears left.

Total snowfall = 513 centimeters
Amount the snowplow can clear at a time = 170 centimeters

Number of passes = Total snowfall / Amount the snowplow can clear at a time = 513 / 170 = 3

Snow left over after the final pass = Total snowfall - (Number of passes * Amount the snowplow can clear at a time) = 513 - (3 * 170) = 513 - 510 = 3

So, there will be 3 centimeters of snow left over after the final pass.

To find out how many centimeters of snow will be left over after the final pass, we need to divide the total snowfall by the amount the snowplow can clear at a time and then subtract the result from the total snowfall.

Let's calculate:
Total snowfall = 460 centimeters

Since the snowplow can only make whole passes, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of passes = 2

Snow left over after the final pass = Total snowfall - (Number of passes * Amount the snowplow can clear at a time) = 460 - (2 * 170) = 460 - 340 = 120

So, there will be 120 centimeters of snow left over after the final pass.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The factory has 380 chairs and each shop can only hold 310 chairs.
To find out how many chairs will be left at the factory, we need to divide the total number of chairs by the number of chairs each shop can hold and then subtract the result from the total number of chairs.
380 chairs / 310 chairs per shop = 1.225726 (rounded to 5 decimal places)
Since we can't have a fraction of a shop, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.
So, the factory can distribute the chairs to 1 shop.
To find out how many chairs will be left at the factory, we subtract the number of chairs each shop can hold from the total number of chairs.
380 chairs - 310 chairs = 70 chairs
Therefore, there will be 70 chairs left at the factory.

To find out how many chairs will be left at the factory, we need to divide the total number of chairs by the number of chairs each smaller distributor can hold and then subtract the result from the total number of chairs.
380 chairs / 143 chairs per smaller distributor = 2.65962 (rounded to 5 decimal places)
Since we can't have a fraction of a smaller distributor, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.
So, the factory can distribute the chairs to 2 smaller distributors.
To find out how many chairs will be left at the factory, we subtract the number of chairs each smaller distributor can hold from the total number of chairs.
380 chairs - (2 * 143 chairs) = 380 chairs - 286 chairs = 94 chairs

            A scooter manufacturing company has produced 767 scooters. Each delivery truck they use can carry 369 scooters. If they distribute the scooters evenly among the trucks, how many scooters will be left after all the trucks are loaded?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The number of scooters that can be loaded onto the trucks is 767 scooters / 369 scooters per truck = 2 trucks.
The number of scooters left after all the trucks are loaded is 767 scooters - (2 trucks * 369 scooters per truck) = 767 scooters - 738 scooters = 29 scooters.

To find out how many raindrops can be formed, we divide the total number of droplets by the number of droplets needed to form a raindrop: 846 / 722 = 1.167. Since we can't have a fraction of a raindrop, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1.

Now, to find out how many droplets are left unconverted, we subtract the number of droplets used to form raindrops from the total number of droplets: 846 - (722 * 1) = 846 - 722 = 124.

            Unicorn Village, a magical place where 265 unicorns live, is divided into 146 equal sections where these magical creatures reside. If each section is occupied by an equal number of unicorns, how many unicorns will live in the last incomplete section?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The total number of unicorns is 265, and the total number of sections is 146.
If each section is occupied by an equal number of unicorns, then the number of unicorns in each section is 265/146 = 1.81 (rounded to two decimal places).
Since we cannot have a fraction of a unicorn, we need to find the number of whole unicorns that can fit in the last incomplete section.
To do this, we need to find the remainder when 265 is divided by 146.
265 divided by 146 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 119.
Therefore, the last incomplete section will have 119 unicorns.

To find out how many players will be left waiting after filling all the matches, we need to subtract the total number of players that can enter a match from the total number of players waiting.

Total players waiting = 923
Players that can enter a match = 383

Number of players left waiting = Total players waiting - Players that can enter a match
Number of players left waiting = 923 - 383
Number of players left waiting = 540

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The number of dolls left unarranged can be found by taking the total number of dolls and subtracting the number of dolls arranged in rows.
The total number of dolls arranged in rows is the number of dolls per row multiplied by the number of rows.
The number of rows is the total number of dolls divided by the number of dolls per row.
So, the number of dolls left unarranged is 603 - (369 * (603 / 369)).

Calculating the number of dolls left unarranged:
603 - (369 * (603 / 369)) = 603 - (369 * 1.64) = 603 - 611.56 = -8.56

Since the number of dolls left unarranged cannot be negative, we can conclude that all the dolls were arranged in rows and there were no dolls left unarranged.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
If every 44 steps lead to a significant place or clue, then the number of significant places or clues can be found by dividing the total number of steps by 44.
The number of steps left after reaching the last significant place or clue can be found by subtracting the total number of steps from the number of significant places or clues multiplied by 44.

Let's calculate:
Number of significant places or clues = 236 / 44 = 5.36
Since we can't have a fraction of a significant place or clue, we round down to the nearest whole number.
Number of significant places or clues = 5

Number of steps left after reaching the last significant place or clue = 236 - (5 * 44) = 236 - 220 = 16

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The machine forms groups of 507 bubbles each. To find out how many groups of 507 bubbles can be formed from 932 bubbles, we divide 932 by 507.

932 ï¿½ 507 = 1 remainder 425

This means that the machine can form 1 complete group of 507 bubbles, and there will be 425 bubbles left over for the final, incomplete group.

So, the machine makes 425 bubbles in its final, incomplete group.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
There are 931 kids in total and each swing set can accommodate 34 kids at a time.
To find out how many kids will be waiting for their turn, we need to subtract the number of kids that can be accommodated by the swing sets from the total number of kids.
The number of kids that can be accommodated by the swing sets is 34 kids per swing set.
To find out how many swing sets are needed to accommodate all the kids, we divide the total number of kids by the number of kids per swing set.
931 kids / 34 kids per swing set = 27.38181818181818 swing sets.
Since we can't have a fraction of a swing set, we round up to the nearest whole number.
So, we need 28 swing sets to accommodate all the kids.
To find out how many kids will be waiting for their turn, we subtract the number of kids that can be accommodated by the swing sets from the total number of kids.
931 kids - (28 swing sets * 34 kids per swing set) = 931 kids - 952 kids = -21 kids.
Since the number of kids waiting for their turn is negative, it means that all the kids can be accommodated by the swing sets and there will be no kids waiting for their turn.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
John has 943 dollar bills and each wallet can hold 433 dollar bills.
To find out how many wallets John can fill, we divide the total number of dollar bills by the number of dollar bills each wallet can hold: 943 / 433 = 2.18 wallets.
Since John can't have a fraction of a wallet, he can fill 2 wallets completely.
To find out how many dollar bills are left, we subtract the total number of dollar bills in the filled wallets from the total number of dollar bills: 943 - (2 * 433) = 943 - 866 = 77 dollar bills.
So, John has 77 dollar bills left.

The total rainfall over 29 days is 612 inches.
To find the average rainfall per day, we divide the total rainfall by the number of days: 612/29 = 21 inches.
To make the days evenly rainy, we need to distribute the rainfall evenly over the 29 days.
Since the average rainfall per day is 21 inches, we need to distribute 21 inches of rain over each day.
To find the total amount of rain that needs to be distributed, we multiply the average rainfall per day by the number of days: 21 * 29 = 609 inches.
To find the amount of rain that would be left to make the days evenly rainy, we subtract the total amount of rain that needs to be distributed from the total rainfall: 612 - 609 = 3 inches.
Therefore, 3 inches of rain would be left to make the days evenly rainy.

To make the days evenly rainy, we need to distribute the rainfall evenly over the 29 days.
Since the average rainfall per day is 17.4137931034 inches, we need to distribute 17.4137931034 inches of rain over each day.
To find the total amount of rain that needs to be distributed, we multiply the average rainfall per day by the number of days: 17.4137931034 * 29 = 500.9624488966 inches.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find out how many toy cars will be left over after all full packs have been filled, we need to divide the total number of toy cars by the number of cars in each pack and find the remainder.

735 toy cars / 348 cars per pack = 2 packs with a remainder of 39 cars.

So, there will be 39 toy cars left over after all full packs have been filled.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The number of animals that can be supported by each territory is 95.
The total number of animals is 386.
To find out how many territories are needed to accommodate all the animals, we divide the total number of animals by the number of animals that can be supported by each territory: 386 / 95 = 4.
Since the number of animals is not a multiple of 95, there will be a remainder.
To find out how many animals will be left in the last not fully occupied territory, we divide the total number of animals by the number of animals that can be supported by each territory and find the remainder: 386 % 95 = 36.
Therefore, there will be 36 animals left in the last not fully occupied territory.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The rope manufacturer has made a rope of 934 meters in length. This rope is supposed to be cut into smaller pieces, each piece being 902 meters in length.

To find out how many pieces can be cut from the rope, we divide the total length of the rope by the length of each piece:

934 meters / 902 meters = 1.036 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Since we can't have a fraction of a piece, we can only cut 1 piece from the rope.

Now, to find out how many meters will the last piece of the rope be, we subtract the length of the first piece from the total length of the rope:

934 meters - 902 meters = 32 meters

So, the last piece of the rope will be 32 meters in length.

The number of liters of milk left over each day after filling the containers is equal to the total amount of milk produced minus the total amount of milk that can be packaged in the containers.

The total amount of milk produced each day is 561 liters.
The total amount of milk that can be packaged in the containers is 550 liters.

So, the number of liters of milk left over each day after filling the containers is 561 - 550 = 11 liters.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The number of pizzas that can fit into a box is 578.
The total number of pizzas made is 620.
To find out how many pizzas will be left over, we need to divide the total number of pizzas by the number of pizzas that can fit into a box and then subtract the result from the total number of pizzas.

620 pizzas / 578 pizzas per box = 1.07 boxes
Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 box.

Now, we subtract the number of pizzas that can fit into a box from the total number of pizzas:
620 pizzas - (1 box * 578 pizzas per box) = 620 pizzas - 578 pizzas = 42 pizzas

So, there will be 42 pizzas left over that don't fit into a box.

To find out how many pizzas will be left over, we need to divide the total number of pizzas by the number of pizzas that can fit into a box and then subtract the result from the total number of pizzas.

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 box.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The cloud loses water droplets at an equal rate, and it becomes entirely dry after every 289 droplets. This means that the cloud loses 289 droplets in each cycle.

To find out how many droplets will be left when the cloud is dry after the final cycle, we need to determine how many cycles the cloud goes through.

We can do this by dividing the initial number of droplets (516) by the number of droplets lost in each cycle (289).

516 ï¿½ 289 = 1.79 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since the cloud loses droplets at an equal rate, it will go through 1 full cycle and part of another cycle. In the first full cycle, the cloud loses 289 droplets, leaving 227 droplets remaining.

In the second cycle, the cloud loses 289 - 227 = 62 droplets.

So, when the cloud is dry after the final cycle, there will be 0 droplets left.</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
John has 365 coins and 140 wallets. To find out how many coins he can put in each wallet, we divide the total number of coins by the number of wallets:
365 / 140 = 2.6071428571428571
Since John cannot put a fraction of a coin in each wallet, he will have to round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, he can put 2 coins in each wallet.
To find out how many coins will be left, we multiply the number of wallets by the number of coins per wallet and subtract the result from the total number of coins:
365 - (140 * 2) = 365 - 280 = 85
John will have 85 coins left.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The number of penguins in the final group will be the remainder when the total number of penguins is divided by the number of penguins in each group.
309 divided by 293 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 16.
Therefore, there will be 16 penguins in the final group.

            A sandwich shop has 580 slices of bread. They use 18 slices of bread for each sandwich-making batch. After using up the bread in these batches, how many slices will they have left?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The shop uses 18 slices of bread for each batch, and they have 580 slices of bread.
To find out how many batches they can make, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per batch: 580/18 = &lt;&lt;580/18=32.22222222222222&gt;&gt;32.22222222222222 batches.
Since they can't make a fraction of a batch, they can make 32 batches.
To find out how many slices they will have left, we subtract the number of slices used from the total number of slices: 580 - (32 * 18) = &lt;&lt;580-(32*18)=20&gt;&gt;20 slices.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The tailor has 925 meters of fabric and uses 529 meters of fabric to make each dress.
To find out how many dresses the tailor can make, we divide the total fabric by the fabric used for each dress: 925 / 529 = 1.75.
Since the tailor cannot make a fraction of a dress, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 dress.
To find out how much fabric will be left over, we subtract the fabric used for the dress from the total fabric: 925 - 529 = 396 meters.
Therefore, the tailor will have 396 meters of fabric left over after completing the dresses.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The tailor has 62 meters of fabric left and uses 529 meters of fabric to make each dress.
To find out how many dresses the tailor can make, we divide the remaining fabric by the fabric used for each dress: 62 / 529 = 0.117.
Since the tailor cannot make a fraction of a dress, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 0 dresses.
Therefore, the tailor cannot make any more dresses with the remaining fabric.

There are 976 tourists in total.
Each tour group can accommodate up to 530 people.
To find out how many tourists will be left for the last group, we need to divide the total number of tourists by the number of people each group can accommodate and then subtract the result from the total number of tourists.
976 / 530 = 1 (with a remainder of 446)
