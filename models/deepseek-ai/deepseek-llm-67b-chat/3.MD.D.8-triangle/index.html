An equilateral triangle has three equal sides. To find the length of each side, we can divide the perimeter by the number of sides.

Solution:
The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 990 cm.
Since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 3 to find the length of each side.

Length of each side = Perimeter / Number of sides
Length of each side = 990 cm / 3
Length of each side = 330 cm

Each side of the equilateral triangle is 330 cm long.</pre>

Let's denote the length of the third side as x. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. So, we can write the equation as:

2 + 667 + x = 997

x = 997 - 2 - 667
x = 328

The length of the third side is 328m.

Let's denote the length of the third side as x. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

192m + 159m + x = 861m

Now, we can solve for x:

351m + x = 861m

Subtract 351m from both sides:

x = 861m - 351m

x = 510m

The length of the third side is 510m.

If the triangle has equal sides, it is an equilateral triangle. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal in length.
Let's denote the length of one side as x. Since there are three equal sides, the perimeter of the triangle is 3x.
We know that the perimeter is 489 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:
3x = 489
To find the length of one side, we need to solve for x:

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 804m.
We know the lengths of two sides: 180m and 579m.
Let's denote the length of the third side as x.
The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides, so we can write the equation:
180m + 579m + x = 804m
Let's solve for x:
759m + x = 804m
To isolate x, we subtract 759m from both sides of the equation:
759m - 759m + x = 804m - 759m
x = 45m
The length of the third side is 45m.

An equilateral triangle has three equal sides. To find the length of each side, we can divide the perimeter by the number of sides.

Solution:
The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 594 cm.
Since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 3 to find the length of each side.

Length of each side = Perimeter / Number of sides
Length of each side = 594 cm / 3
Length of each side = 198 cm

Each side of the equilateral triangle is 198 cm long.</pre>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the length of the third side as x. We know that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side.

According to the given information, we have:
250m + 435m + x = 898m

Solving for x:
x = 898m - (250m + 435m)
x = 898m - 685m
x = 213m

So, the length of the third side of the triangle is 213m.

If a triangle has three equal sides, it is an equilateral triangle. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides.
Let's denote the length of each side as x. Since the triangle is equilateral, all three sides have the same length.
The perimeter of the triangle is given as 255 meters.
So, the equation for the perimeter is:
x + x + x = 255
Let's simplify and solve for x:
3x = 255
To isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
3x / 3 = 255 / 3
x = 85
The length of each side is 85 meters.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the lengths of the two given sides as a and b, and the length of the unknown side as c. We know that a = 204m, b = 195m, and the perimeter of the triangle is 721m. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides, so we can write the equation:

a + b + c = perimeter

Now, we can plug in the given values:

204 + 195 + c = 721

Now, we can solve for c:

c = 721 - (204 + 195)
c = 721 - 399
c = 322

So, the length of the third side of the triangle is 322m.

If all sides of the triangle are equal, then each side has the same length. Let's denote the length of each side as x.

Since the perimeter of the triangle is 195 cm, the sum of the lengths of all three sides is equal to 195 cm.

Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + x + x = 195

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x = 195

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 195 / 3

x = 65

So, the length of each side of the triangle is 65 cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
An equilateral triangle has three equal sides. To find the length of each side, we can divide the perimeter by the number of sides.

Solution:
The perimeter of the triangle is 321 meters, and since it is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. Therefore, we can divide the perimeter by 3 to find the length of each side.

Length of each side = Perimeter / Number of sides
Length of each side = 321 meters / 3
Length of each side = 107 meters

So, the length of each side of the triangle is 107 meters.

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 998m. We know the lengths of two sides, so we can find the length of the third side by subtracting the sum of the known sides from the perimeter.

Solution:
Perimeter = 998m

Let's denote the lengths of the two given sides as a and b, and the length of the unknown side as c. We know that the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Therefore, we can write the equation:

a + b + c = perimeter

We are given the values of a and b, and the perimeter, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

57 + 426 + c = 850

Now, we can solve for c:

c = 850 - (57 + 426)
c = 850 - 483
c = 367

An equilateral triangle has three equal sides. To find the length of each side, we can divide the perimeter by the number of sides.

Solution:
The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 723 cm.
Since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 3 to find the length of each side.

Let's denote the length of the third side as x. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is 867m.
Let's denote the length of the third side as x.
The sum of the lengths of the first two sides is 287m + 475m = 762m.
The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides, so we can write the equation as:
762m + x = 867m
Now, we can solve for x:
x = 867m - 762m
x = 105m
The length of the third side is 105m.

Let's denote the lengths of the two known sides as a and b, and the length of the unknown side as c. We know that a = 828m and b = 10m. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides, so we can write the equation:

a + b + c = 934

Now, we can substitute the known values of a and b into the equation:

828 + 10 + c = 934

Next, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

838 + c = 934

Now, we can solve for c by subtracting 838 from both sides of the equation:

c = 934 - 838

c = 96

So, the length of the third side (c) is 96 meters.</pre>

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 661m - (382m + 151m)

Solution:
The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 537m.
Since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 3 to find the length of each side.

Length of each side = Perimeter / Number of sides
Length of each side = 537m / 3
Length of each side = 179m

Each side of the equilateral triangle is 179m long.</pre>

            A triangle has a perimeter of 568m. The lengths of two of its sides are 110m and 205m. What is the length of the third side?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the lengths of the two known sides as a and b, and the length of the unknown side as c. We know that a = 110m, b = 205m, and the perimeter of the triangle is 568m. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Therefore, we can write the equation:

a + b + c = perimeter

Substituting the given values, we get:

110 + 205 + c = 568

Now, we need to solve for c:

c = 568 - (110 + 205)
c = 568 - 315
c = 253

So, the length of the third side is 253m.

Let's denote the length of the third side as x. We know that the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all its sides. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

325 + 15 + x = 633

x = 633 - 325 - 15
x = 293

The length of the third side of the garden is 293 meters.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Let's denote the lengths of the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c. We know that a = 464m, b = 377m, and the perimeter of the triangle is 907m. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides, so we can write the equation:

a + b + c = perimeter

Substituting the given values, we get:

464 + 377 + c = 907

Now, we can solve for c:

c = 907 - (464 + 377)
c = 907 - 841
c = 66

So, the length of the third side is 66m.
