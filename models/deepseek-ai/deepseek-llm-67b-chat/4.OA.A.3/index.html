            A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

The biologist counted 35 penguins on the first ice floe.
The second group of penguins was divided evenly among 26 ice floes, so there were 598/26 = &lt;&lt;598/26=23&gt;&gt;23 penguins on each ice floe.
The penguin population on the first ice floe increased by 49, so there were 35+49 = &lt;&lt;35+49=84&gt;&gt;84 penguins on the first ice floe.
The biologist decided to take 33 more penguins into account, but then realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10, so she added 33-10 = &lt;&lt;33-10=23&gt;&gt;23 penguins to her count.
The biologist also added the penguins she'd left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks, so she added 20+14 = &lt;&lt;20+14=34&gt;&gt;34 penguins to her count.
In total, the biologist counted 35+23*26+84+23+34 = &lt;&lt;35+23*26+84+23+34=1000&gt;&gt;1000 penguins.

Subtract 22 from the average rainfall of the typical cloud per hour then multiply this by 23. Add this result to a constant cloud factor of 42. Add this new result to the hourly rainfall of the initial cloud and subtract 2 from it. What is the resultant millimeters of rainfall?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Subtract 22 from the average rainfall of the typical cloud per hour:
   775 millimeters / 31 hours = 25 millimeters per hour
   25 - 22 = 3 millimeters per hour

2. Multiply this by 23:
   3 millimeters per hour * 23 hours = 69 millimeters

3. Add this result to a constant cloud factor of 42:
   69 millimeters + 42 = 111 millimeters

4. Add this new result to the hourly rainfall of the initial cloud:
   111 millimeters + 47 millimeters = 158 millimeters

5. Subtract 2 from it:
   158 millimeters - 2 = 156 millimeters

The resultant millimeters of rainfall is 156 millimeters.</pre>

            A young boy with a creative mind decided to build a kite. He started with 37 paper straws but decided that 4 were unnecessary and removed them. Later, he realized his kite was still too bulky and removed another 23 straws. He multiplied the remaining number of straws by 45, subtracted 49 from that total, and then took out 7 more straws. How many straws did the boy have left?

The boy started with 37 straws, removed 4, and then removed another 23, so he had 37 - 4 - 23 = &lt;&lt;37-4-23=10&gt;&gt;10 straws left.
He multiplied the remaining number of straws by 45, so he had 10 * 45 = &lt;&lt;10*45=450&gt;&gt;450 straws.
He subtracted 49 from that total, so he had 450 - 49 = &lt;&lt;450-49=401&gt;&gt;401 straws.
He took out 7 more straws, so he had 401 - 7 = &lt;&lt;401-7=394&gt;&gt;394 straws left.

There were 2 trips, and each trip saw 2 animals, so there were 2*2 = &lt;&lt;2*2=4&gt;&gt;4 animals seen in total.
Each animal had 3 baby animals, so there were 4*3 = &lt;&lt;4*3=12&gt;&gt;12 baby animals seen in total.
The total number of animals seen was 4+12 = &lt;&lt;4+12=16&gt;&gt;16.
Each animal could be photographed 21 times, so the total number of photos taken was 16*21 = &lt;&lt;16*21=336&gt;&gt;336.
However, 34 photos were spoiled, so the number of usable photos was 336-34 = &lt;&lt;336-34=302&gt;&gt;302.

            A turtle named Tommy moves at 74/37 miles per hour. If Tommy maintains his current speed for a while then slows down by 3 mph, then speeds up to his initial speed again, what would be his average speed?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Tommy's initial speed is 74/37 miles per hour.
If he slows down by 3 mph, his speed becomes 74/37 - 3 = 47/37 miles per hour.
If he speeds up to his initial speed again, his speed becomes 74/37 miles per hour.
To find his average speed, we need to consider the time he spends at each speed.
Let's assume he spends equal time at each speed.
Let's denote the time he spends at each speed as t.
The distance he travels at his initial speed is 74/37 * t = 74t/37.
The distance he travels at his slowed-down speed is 47/37 * t = 47t/37.
The total distance he travels is 74t/37 + 47t/37 = 121t/37.
The total time he spends is 2t.
Therefore, his average speed is 121t/37 / 2t = 121/74 miles per hour.

            There were 47 inches of snowfall in January and an additional 7 inches in early February. On February 15th, there was an additional 17 inches of snowfall. Then, 48 inches of snow fell in March. In April, we had an additional 31 inches of snowfall early on, but then 27 inches melted by the end of the month. How many inches of snow does this sum up to at the end of April?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
In January, there were 47 inches of snowfall.
In early February, there was an additional 7 inches of snowfall.
On February 15th, there was an additional 17 inches of snowfall.
In March, there were 48 inches of snowfall.
In April, there was an additional 31 inches of snowfall early on.
By the end of April, 27 inches of snow melted.

To find the total inches of snow at the end of April, we add up all the snowfall and subtract the melted snow:

Total snowfall = 47 + 7 + 17 + 48 + 31 = &lt;&lt;47+7+17+48+31=151&gt;&gt;151 inches

Melted snow = 27 inches

Total inches of snow at the end of April = 151 - 27 = &lt;&lt;151-27=124&gt;&gt;124 inches

            A toothbrush factory produces 37 toothbrushes per minute at the start of its morning shift. A little later, it increases its production to rate to 308 toothbrushes every 7 minutes. If this increased rate of production continued for 16 minutes, how many toothbrushes were produced in total?

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The factory produces 37 toothbrushes per minute at the start of its morning shift.
The factory increases its production rate to 308 toothbrushes every 7 minutes.
If this increased rate of production continued for 16 minutes, we need to find out how many sets of 7 minutes are there in 16 minutes.
There are 16/7 = 2.2857 sets of 7 minutes in 16 minutes.
Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2 sets.
So, the factory produced 308 toothbrushes per set for 2 sets, which is 308 * 2 = 616 toothbrushes.
In addition to the toothbrushes produced at the start of the morning shift, the total number of toothbrushes produced is 37 + 616 = 653 toothbrushes.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The number of telescopes in the research laboratory at the end of the sixth month is the sum of the initial number of telescopes and the number of telescopes added in each month.

Initial number of telescopes = 39
Number of telescopes added in the first month = 7
Number of telescopes added in the second month = 17
Number of telescopes added in the third month = 12
Number of telescopes added in the fourth month = 18
Number of telescopes added in the fifth month = 39
Number of telescopes added in the sixth month = 19

Total number of telescopes at the end of the sixth month = 39 + 7 + 17 + 12 + 18 + 39 + 19 = 142

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The initial number of utensils on the table was 20 forks + 23 knives = &lt;&lt;20+23=43&gt;&gt;43 utensils.
The number of utensils added later was 28 sets * 26 utensils/set = &lt;&lt;28*26=728&gt;&gt;728 utensils.
The total number of utensils expected on the table was 43 initial utensils + 728 added utensils = &lt;&lt;43+728=771&gt;&gt;771 utensils.
However, there were 7 more utensils than expected, so the actual number of utensils on the table was 771 expected utensils + 7 extra utensils = &lt;&lt;771+7=778&gt;&gt;778 utensils.
There were 46 missing utensils, so the final number of utensils on the table was 778 actual utensils - 46 missing utensils = &lt;&lt;778-46=732&gt;&gt;732 utensils.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the height of the window frame.
2. Then, we need to find the width of the window.
3. Next, we need to find the circumference of the window.
4. Finally, we need to find the size of the glass required for the window.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Height of the window frame = (925/37) + 26
2. Width of the window = Height + 11
3. Circumference of the window = 2 * Width + Height
4. Size of the glass = Circumference - 32

Now, let's calculate the values:

1. Height of the window frame = (925/37) + 26 = 25 + 26 = 51 inches
2. Width of the window = 51 + 11 = 62 inches
3. Circumference of the window = 2 * 62 + 51 = 124 + 51 = 175 inches
4. Size of the glass = 175 - 32 = 143 inches

So, the size of the glass required for the window is 143 inches.</pre>

First, we need to find the weight of one piece of chocolate. Since each bar weighs 176 grams and is divided into 8 pieces, each piece weighs 176/8 = 22 grams.

For the second batch of chocolates, the total weight of ingredients is 38 grams of cocoa - 22 grams of one piece + 26 grams of sugar = 42 grams.

For the third batch of chocolates, the total weight of ingredients is 38 grams of cocoa + 18 grams of milk = 56 grams.

The difference in the total weight of ingredients between the second and third batch of chocolates is 56 grams - 42 grams = 14 grams.

In the first mixture, you have 41 drops of red paint + 13 drops of white paint = &lt;&lt;41+13=54&gt;&gt;54 drops of paint.
You then add the same amount of red paint as before, which is 41 drops, so the total drops of paint in the first mixture is 54 + 41 = &lt;&lt;54+41=95&gt;&gt;95 drops.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The difference between the number of toy cars made on Monday and Tuesday is 32 - 27 = &lt;&lt;32-27=5&gt;&gt;5.
The weekly goal is the difference multiplied by 49, so it is 5 * 49 = &lt;&lt;5*49=245&gt;&gt;245 toy cars.
The staff members make 12 * 9 = &lt;&lt;12*9=108&gt;&gt;108 toy cars a day.
The total number of toy cars prepared by staff members is 108 * 5 = &lt;&lt;108*5=540&gt;&gt;540 toy cars.
The total number of toy cars prepared by staff members plus the additional 45 toy cars is 540 + 45 = &lt;&lt;540+45=585&gt;&gt;585 toy cars.
The total number of toy cars made in this process is the weekly goal plus the total number of toy cars prepared by staff members, so it is 245 + 585 = &lt;&lt;245+585=830&gt;&gt;830 toy cars.

            In the initial phase of the puzzle game, instead of collecting 150 points in each of the first two rounds, let's say you managed to collect fewer points such that each round you earned only 15 gold coins as the points were divided by 10.

Therefore, after the second round, you had a different amount of gold coins. In the third round, you collected 28 emeralds and 14 sapphires but had to sacrifice the same newly calculated amount of gold coins (as per the points collected in the first two rounds). How many emeralds and sapphires did you have left after adjusting for the gold coin sacrifice in the third round?

In the first two rounds, you earned 15 gold coins each round.
So, you earned a total of 15+15 = &lt;&lt;15+15=30&gt;&gt;30 gold coins in the first two rounds.
In the third round, you had to sacrifice 30 gold coins, so you had 28+14-30 = &lt;&lt;28+14-30=12&gt;&gt;12 emeralds and sapphires left.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The train carries 15 containers every day.
On Fridays, the train carries an extra 12 containers, so it carries 15+12 = &lt;&lt;15+12=27&gt;&gt;27 containers.
On Monday, the train carries an additional 26 containers, so it carries 15+26 = &lt;&lt;15+26=41&gt;&gt;41 containers.
On Wednesday, the load decreases by 32 containers, so it carries 15-32 = &lt;&lt;15-32=-17&gt;&gt;-17 containers.
The train is coupled with 2 more containers, so it carries -17+2 = &lt;&lt;-17+2=-15&gt;&gt;-15 containers.
After one stop, an additional 48 containers are loaded onto the train, so it carries -15+48 = &lt;&lt;-15+48=33&gt;&gt;33 containers.
The train is carrying 33 containers at this point.

The difference in their daily averages is 42 - 23 = &lt;&lt;42-23=19&gt;&gt;19.

            The previous problem had us determine the total number of police officers on duty under certain conditions. Now, let's imagine a slightly different scenario.

Like the previous situation, there were still 32 officers assigned to the north district and 33 sent to the south. The number for the downtown district was also the same, at 29. However, this time around, only 21 officers from the total force were transferred elsewhere instead of the original scenario's subtraction. A week later, an additional 22 officers, fewer than the 39 from the original scenario, were brought in for a different assignment. That same day, another addition of 14 officers was made, just like with the initial series of events.

The distance between the Moon and the Earth decreased by 19 million kilometers, so the new distance is 36 - 19 = &lt;&lt;36-19=17&gt;&gt;17 million kilometers.
Then it increased again by 11 million kilometers, so the final distance is 17 + 11 = &lt;&lt;17+11=28&gt;&gt;28 million kilometers.
The value we are looking for is the distance times 19 minus 27, so it is 28 * 19 - 27 = &lt;&lt;28*19-27=492-27=465&gt;&gt;465.

The first tiger covered 2 steps of 9 meters each, so it covered 2*9 = &lt;&lt;2*9=18&gt;&gt;18 meters.
Then it leaped 44 meters, so the total distance covered by the first tiger is 18+44 = &lt;&lt;18+44=62&gt;&gt;62 meters.
The second tiger covered 23 meters and then leaped 46 meters, so it covered 23+46 = &lt;&lt;23+46=69&gt;&gt;69 meters.
Then it retraced the distance equal to the first tiger's steps and leap, which is 18+44 = &lt;&lt;18+44=62&gt;&gt;62 meters.
So, the total distance covered by the second tiger is 69+62 = &lt;&lt;69+62=131&gt;&gt;131 meters.

            A toothpaste factory produces 26 tubes of toothpaste every hour. On Sundays, they work for 7 hours and produce additional 8 tubes of toothpaste. So, in one Sunday, they produce ((26 * 7) + 8) tubes.

The following Monday, they continue their production by adding another 31 tubes to their Sunday's total.

In parallel, in the packaging department, they have 50 empty boxes. They use 19 of them for another department, leaving them with (50 - 19) boxes.

The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is calculated by adding the packaged boxes number with Monday's production.

On Tuesday, they produced an additional 48 tubes of toothpaste. What is the total number of produced toothpaste tubes until Tuesday, inclusive?

On Sunday, they produced 26 tubes/hour * 7 hours + 8 tubes = 200 tubes.

On Monday, they produced 200 tubes + 31 tubes = 231 tubes.

The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is 231 tubes + 31 boxes = 262 tubes.

46 frogs * 21 flies/frog = 966 flies

Answer: All the frogs catch 966 flies in a day.</pre>

            A treasure chest contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds. Unfortunately, 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed. The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest. 

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

What is the value (m) of the remaining treasure?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the number of real stones left in the first chest.
2. Then, we need to find the value of the first chest.
3. Next, we need to find the number of rubies left after sharing and losing some.
4. Then, we need to find the new value after subtracting the number of rubies from the value of the first chest.
5. Finally, we need to find the value of the remaining treasure after subtracting the count of pearls and zirconias from the new value.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The number of real stones left in the first chest:
   Real emeralds = 23 - 0 (no fake emeralds)
   Real diamonds = 30 - 39 (all diamonds are fake)
   Total real stones = 23 + 0 = 23

2. The value of the first chest:
   Value = (Total real stones)Â² - 37
   Value = 23Â² - 37 = 529 - 37 = 492

3. The number of rubies left after sharing and losing some:
   Rubies = 540 - (45 * 13) - 3 = 540 - 585 = -45
   Since the number of rubies cannot be negative, we assume that the pirates took the loss of 45 rubies.

4. The new value after subtracting the number of rubies from the value of the first chest:
   New value = Value - Rubies = 492 - (-45) = 492 + 45 = 537

5. The value of the remaining treasure after subtracting the count of pearls and zirconias from the new value:
   Count = 23 (pearls) + 11 (zirconias) - 9 (damaged) = 25
   Value (m) = New value - Count = 537 - 25 = 512

The value of the remaining treasure is 512.</pre>

Additionally, she found 49 more seashells. However, let's reconsider the story and change the part where Amy gave away 23 seashells to her brother. Instead, imagine that she gave away 32 seashells to her brother. If she still gave 27 seashells to her cousin after this, how many seashells does Amy have left now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Amy had 21-15 = &lt;&lt;21-15=6&gt;&gt;6 seashells remaining after giving some to her sister.
The next day, she found 6+13 = &lt;&lt;6+13=19&gt;&gt;19 seashells, which is 13 more than the amount she had remaining from the previous day.
She also found an additional 49 seashells, so she had a total of 19+49 = &lt;&lt;19+49=68&gt;&gt;68 seashells.
Amy gave 32+27 = &lt;&lt;32+27=59&gt;&gt;59 seashells to her brother and cousin.
Therefore, Amy has 68-59 = &lt;&lt;68-59=9&gt;&gt;9 seashells left.

            Princess Anna was playing a numbers game in the kingdom. In the first round of the game, she thought of two numbers: 7 and 10. She added them together.

In the second round, she thought of a number 29. She subtracted the result from the first round and then subtracted 8 more from that result.

In the final round, Princess Anna added the results from the first and second round and then multiplied the sum by the result from the second round. What was the final result of the Princess's game?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
In the first round, Princess Anna added 7 and 10, which equals 17.
In the second round, she subtracted the result from the first round (17) and then subtracted 8 more from that result. So, 17 - 17 - 8 = -20.
In the final round, Princess Anna added the results from the first and second round (17 + (-20) = -3) and then multiplied the sum by the result from the second round (-20). So, -3 * -20 = 60.
The final result of the Princess's game is 60.

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The hiker traveled an average of 900 miles in 36 days, so his daily average was 900/36 = 25 miles per day.
When he increased his daily average to 16 miles, he reduced his remaining journey by a certain number of days. Let's call this number of days &quot;x&quot;.
So, the remaining journey after increasing his daily average is 900 - (25 - 16) * x = 900 - 9x miles.
After finding a shortcut that saves him 4 days, the remaining journey is 900 - 9x - 4 * 25 = 900 - 9x - 100 = 800 - 9x miles.
After a friendly traveler advised him of another path that saves him 40 days, the remaining journey is 800 - 9x - 40 * 25 = 800 - 9x - 1000 = -100 - 9x miles.
Since the remaining journey cannot be negative, we can conclude that x = 100/9 = 11.11 days.
So, the hiker saved 11.11 + 4 + 40 + 21 = 76.11 days on his journey.

The number of rooms in the first wing is given as 5.
The number of bricks in the second wing is given as 216.
According to the rule, one room is equivalent to 36 bricks.

To find the number of rooms in the second wing, we need to divide the number of bricks by the number of bricks per room:

Number of rooms in the second wing = 216 bricks / 36 bricks per room = 6 rooms

Now, to find the total number of rooms in both wings, we add the number of rooms in each wing:

Total number of rooms = 5 rooms (first wing) + 6 rooms (second wing) = 11 rooms

So, according to the rule, there would be 11 rooms in total.</pre>

            <span class="response-field">DeepSeek 67B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the ticks per minute for each clock.
   - For the first clock, it ticks 504 times in 42 minutes. So, the ticks per minute are 504/42 = 12 ticks per minute.
   - For the second clock, it ticks 279 times in 31 minutes. So, the ticks per minute are 279/31 = 9 ticks per minute.

2. Next, we need to add 34 to the rate of the second clock's ticks per minute.
   - 9 ticks per minute + 34 = 43 ticks per minute.

3. Then, we need to multiply the first clock's ticks per minute by 35 and subtract 41 from it.
   - 12 ticks per minute * 35 = 420 ticks.
   - 420 ticks - 41 = 379 ticks.

4. Finally, we need to subtract the rate of the second clock (after adding 34) from the manipulated rate of the first clock.
   - 379 ticks - 43 ticks = 336 ticks.

The final value is 336 ticks.</pre>

            The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

   (37 - 32) + 42 - 37 = 12

2. They then decided to add squares for minutes and seconds:
   12 + (25 + 28) = 12 + 53 = 65

3. They did more math:
   65 + 41 + 28 + 17 = 151

4. They decided to reduce the total number of squares by 23:
   151 - 23 = 128

5. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number:
   128 + 12 = 140

So, your friend would need 140 squares in total to complete their quirky clock.</pre>

The farm produced 28*2 = &lt;&lt;28*2=56&gt;&gt;56 pounds of oranges in a single day due to the new method.
The total production for the 15 days of the harvest period is 56*15 = &lt;&lt;56*15=840&gt;&gt;840 pounds.
The farm added 16 pounds of a rare orange variant to this harvest, so the total production is 840+16 = &lt;&lt;840+16=856&gt;&gt;856 pounds.

            Previously, the orange farm had been able to double its typical daily output of 28 pounds to increase its harvest yield. However, imagine what would have happened had the farm originally been producing a lesser daily output, such as 7 pounds. If they were still able to double this amount each day of the 15-day harvest period and added the same 16 pounds of the rare orange variant to their yield, how much would the farm have produced in that case?

The farm originally produced 7 pounds of oranges per day.
If they doubled this amount each day of the 15-day harvest period, they would have produced 7*2 = &lt;&lt;7*2=14&gt;&gt;14 pounds of oranges per day.
The total production for the 15 days of the harvest period would be 14*15 = &lt;&lt;14*15=210&gt;&gt;210 pounds.
The farm added 16 pounds of a rare orange variant to this harvest, so the total production is 210+16 = &lt;&lt;210+16=226&gt;&gt;226 pounds.
