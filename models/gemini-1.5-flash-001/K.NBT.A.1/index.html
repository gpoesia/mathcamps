        If you start with the number 6 and want to add a number n to it so that it equals 10, what is the value of n?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We can represent this problem as an equation: 6 + n = 10

To find the value of n, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides:

6 + n - 6 = 10 - 6

This simplifies to:

n = 4

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The snowman needs 10 lbs of snow for its bottom half, and it currently has 9 lbs.  To find out how much more snow was added, we subtract the current weight from the required weight: 10 lbs - 9 lbs = 1 lb.

        A slide in the park is 12 feet tall. If the top part measures 10 feet, what is the length of the lower section of the slide?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the lower section, we subtract the top part length from the total height of the slide. 

Lower section length = Total height - Top part length 
Lower section length = 12 feet - 10 feet
Lower section length = 2 feet

        John has a guitar with 10 strings. Some of the strings broke, but you know that being left with (e + 6) strings meant the guitar still had 10 strings. What is the value of e, i.e., how many strings were broken?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know that John had 10 strings initially and is left with (e + 6) strings after some break.  This means the number of broken strings is the difference between the initial number and the remaining number of strings.

So, the number of broken strings is 10 - (e + 6) = 10 - e - 6 = 4 - e.

Since the number of broken strings is also represented by 'e', we have:

4 - e = e

Adding 'e' to both sides: 4 = 2e

Dividing both sides by 2: e = 2

Therefore, the value of 'e' is 2.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's use an equation to represent the situation:
