        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they must have the same denominator.  We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 63 and 78.

* **Prime Factorization:**
    * 63 = 3 x 3 x 7
    * 78 = 2 x 3 x 13
* **LCM:** The LCM includes all prime factors, with the highest power of each: 2 x 3 x 3 x 7 x 13 = 1638

Now we need to adjust the fractions:

* (74/63) = (74 * 26) / (63 * 26) = 1924 / 1638
* (91/78) = (91 * 21) / (78 * 21) = 1911 / 1638

Finally, we can add the fractions:

* (1924 / 1638) + (1911 / 1638) = (1924 + 1911) / 1638 = 3835 / 1638

            In the previous problem, we found the sum of 49/79 and 18/21. Now, let's alter the scenario a bit. Instead of having 49/79 part, let's say we have 49/3 part. Keeping the 18/21 part the same, what would be the new total? Calculate the sum of 49/3 and 18/21.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 49/3 and 18/21, we need to find a common denominator.  The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 21 is 21.

Let's rewrite the fractions with the new denominator:

* (18/21) stays the same.

Now we can add the fractions:

343/21 + 18/21 = 361/21

* The LCM of 46 and 31 is 1426.

Now we'll convert each fraction:

* 95/46 * (31/31) = 2945/1426
* 65/31 * (46/46) = 2990/1426

Now we can add the fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they must have the same denominator.  We can find a common denominator by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 63 and 6.

The LCM of 63 and 6 is 126.

* To change 25/63 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 126, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2: 
   (25/63) * (2/2) = 50/126

* To change 74/6 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 126, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 21:
   (74/6) * (21/21) = 1554/126

Now we can add the fractions:

50/126 + 1554/126 = 1604/126

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

1604/126 = (1604/2) / (126/2) = 802/63

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator.  We'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of 91 and 47.

* The prime factorization of 91 is 7 x 13.
* The prime factorization of 47 is just 47 (it's a prime number).

The LCM is the product of all the prime factors, each raised to the highest power they appear in either factorization: 7 x 13 x 47 = 4277.

Now we need to rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 4277:

* 79/91 = (79/91) * (47/47) = 3713/4277
* 100/47 = (100/47) * (91/91) = 9100/4277

Finally, we can add the fractions:

3713/4277 + 9100/4277 = (3713 + 9100)/4277 = 12813/4277

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they must have a common denominator.  The least common multiple of 88 and 13 is 1144. 

* We can rewrite 87/88 as (87 * 13)/(88 * 13) = 1131/1144
* We can rewrite 24/13 as (24 * 88)/(13 * 88) = 2112/1144

Now we can add the fractions:

1131/1144 + 2112/1144 = (1131 + 2112)/1144 = 3243/1144

This fraction can be simplified to a mixed number: 3243/1144 = 2 955/1144

First, simplify 36/9 to 4. 

Now we need to find a common denominator for 3243/1144 and 4:

* 3243/1144 stays the same
* 4 can be rewritten as (4 * 1144)/1144 = 4576/1144

Now we can add the fractions:

3243/1144 + 4576/1144 = (3243 + 4576)/1144 = 7819/1144

This fraction can be simplified to a mixed number: 7819/1144 = 6 847/1144

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, let's simplify the fractions:

* 68/33 cannot be simplified further.
* 70/25 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5: 70/5 = 14 and 25/5 = 5, making the simplified fraction 14/5.

Now we have: (68/33) + (14/5)

To add fractions, they need a common denominator.  The least common multiple of 33 and 5 is 165.

* Convert 68/33 to have a denominator of 165: (68/33) * (5/5) = 340/165
* Convert 14/5 to have a denominator of 165: (14/5) * (33/33) = 462/165

Now we have: 340/165 + 462/165 = 802/165

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

* 802/2 = 401
* 165/2 = 82.5

*  (11/9) * (97/97) = 1067/873

Now we can add the fractions:

315/873 + 1067/873 = 1382/873

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3:

* **Convert 11/5 to have a denominator of 70:**  Multiply both the numerator and denominator of 11/5 by 14: (11/5) * (14/14) = 154/70

Now we can subtract:

154/70 - 79/70 = (154 - 79) / 70 = 75/70

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 5:

* **Convert 62/46 to have a denominator of 322:** Multiply both the numerator and denominator by 7: (62/46) * (7/7) = 434/322

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator.  We find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 78:

* Factors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16

* LCM of 16 and 78: 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 13 = 312

Now we rewrite each fraction with the denominator 312:

* 52/78 = (52 * 4) / (78 * 4) = 208/312

Finally, we add the fractions:

1326/312 + 208/312 = (1326 + 208)/312 = 1534/312

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

            Instead of the original problem (77/5 + 4/11), consider a change such that now we are adding 77/5 and 4/79 instead. In the context of the previous word problem, if we were originally adding parts of a recipe, we could consider the change as modifying one part of the recipe. What happens if we modify the recipe in this way, by replacing the quantity we originally added with 4/79?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's think of this in terms of a recipe.  Imagine you're baking a cake, and the original recipe called for 77/5 cups of flour and 4/11 cups of sugar.  

Now, instead of 4/11 cups of sugar, you're using 4/79 cups of sugar.  What's the impact?

Since 4/79 is much smaller than 4/11, you're using significantly less sugar in the new recipe. This means your cake will likely be less sweet. 

**The overall impact:** The cake will be less sweet, but it's hard to say exactly how much less sweet without knowing the specific sweetness of the other ingredients. It could be a subtle difference, or it could be quite noticeable. 

It's important to note that modifying a recipe like this can change the balance of flavors.  What was originally intended as a balanced cake may now have a more pronounced floury taste due to the reduced sweetness. 

**In the context of the math problem:** Replacing 4/11 with 4/79 will result in a smaller overall sum. The change is significant because it reduces the amount added by a considerable margin.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of two fractions, they must have the same denominator.  We need to find a common denominator for 48 and 47.  The easiest way to do this is to multiply the two denominators together. 

* 48 * 47 = 2256

Now, we need to adjust the numerators of each fraction:

* (60/48) * (47/47) = 2820/2256
* (37/47) * (48/48) = 1776/2256

Now that we have common denominators, we can add the fractions:

* 2820/2256 + 1776/2256 = 4596/2256

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 8:

* (4596/8) / (2256/8) = 574.5/282

Therefore, the sum of 60/48 and 37/47 is 574.5/282.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the difference between two fractions, they need to have the same denominator.  Let's find a common denominator for 66/20 and 4/78:

* **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators:** The LCM of 20 and 78 is 780.
* **Convert the fractions:**
    * 66/20 = (66 * 39) / (20 * 39) = 2574/780
    * 4/78 = (4 * 10) / (78 * 10) = 40/780

* **Subtract the fractions:**  2574/780 - 40/780 = 2534/780

* **Simplify (if possible):** This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2.  This gives us 1267/390.

Now we need to convert each fraction:

Adding the fractions:

2231/4161 + 3526/4161 = (2231 + 3526) / 4161 = 5757/4161

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they must have the same denominator. We can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 88 and 10, which is 440.

*  Convert 54/88 to a fraction with a denominator of 440: 
   (54/88) * (5/5) = 270/440

*  Convert 28/10 to a fraction with a denominator of 440:
   (28/10) * (44/44) = 1232/440

Now, we can add the fractions: 
270/440 + 1232/440 = 1502/440

Simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:
(1502/2)/(440/2) = 751/220

Now we need to subtract 47/13 from that result.  

**1. Find a common denominator:**

4. **Common Denominator:**  The least common denominator for 5 and 8 is 40.

5. **Convert Fractions:**
   * (14/5) * (8/8) = 112/40 apples
   * (83/8) * (5/5) = 415/40 oranges

6. **Add:**

1. **Simplify 27/72:**
   * Both 27 and 72 are divisible by 9.
   * 27/72 = (27/9) / (72/9) = 3/8

2. **Find a common denominator for 543/245 and 3/8:**

3. **Add the fractions:**
   * (4344/1960) + (735/1960) = (4344 + 735) / 1960 = 5079/1960

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's follow the same steps as before:

1. **Simplify the fractions:**
    * 54/35 is already in its simplest form.
    * 23/49 is also in its simplest form.

2. **Find a common denominator:**
    * The least common multiple of 35 and 49 is 245.
    * To get 245 in the denominator of 54/35, multiply both numerator and denominator by 7: (54 * 7) / (35 * 7) = 378/245
    * To get 245 in the denominator of 23/49, multiply both numerator and denominator by 5: (23 * 5) / (49 * 5) = 115/245

3. **Subtract the fractions:**
    * (378/245) - (115/245) = (378 - 115) / 245 = 263/245

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they must have the same denominator.  The least common denominator of 30 and 37 is 1110.

* We need to multiply 58/30 by 37/37: (58/30) * (37/37) = 2146/1110
* We need to multiply 49/37 by 30/30: (49/37) * (30/30) = 1470/1110

Now we can add the fractions: 2146/1110 + 1470/1110 = (2146 + 1470)/1110

Simplifying the numerator: 3616/1110

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2: 3616/1110 = 1808/555

To subtract fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common denominator for 2 and 5 is 10.

We can rewrite 99/2 as 99*5/2*5 = 495/10.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know that ((33 / 90) + (77 / 79)) is equal to 9537/7110.  Now we need to subtract 7/89 from that result. 

To subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator.  The least common denominator of 7110 and 89 is 7110 * 89 = 632790.

* (9537/7110) * (89/89) = 848333/632790
* (7/89) * (7110/7110) = 50770/632790

Now, we can subtract the fractions:
* (848333/632790) - (50770/632790) = (848333 - 50770)/632790

Now we can subtract:

* (1947/66) - (11/66) = (1947 - 11) / 66 = 1936/66

Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know from the previous answer that subtracting 11/66 from 59/2 results in 968/33.

Now, we need to add 63/51 to 968/33.  To do this, we need a common denominator:

* The least common multiple of 51 and 33 is 561.

Let's rewrite both fractions:

* 63/51 = (63 * 11) / (51 * 11) = 693/561
* 968/33 = (968 * 17) / (33 * 17) = 16456/561

Now we can add them:

* (693/561) + (16456/561) = (693 + 16456)/561 = 17149/561

Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3:

* 17149/561 = (17149/3) / (561/3) = 5716 1/3 / 187

*  Rewrite 70/93 as (70 * 52) / (93 * 52) = 3640/4836.
*  Rewrite 17/52 as (17 * 93) / (52 * 93) = 1581/4836.

Now we can add the fractions:

*  3640/4836 + 1581/4836 = (3640 + 1581) / 4836 = 5221/4836

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. We find the least common multiple (LCM) of 44 and 91 to determine the new denominator.

* The prime factorization of 44 is 2 x 2 x 11.
* The prime factorization of 91 is 7 x 13.

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all the prime factors involved: 2Â² x 7 x 11 x 13 = 4004

Now, we adjust the fractions:

* 78/44 = (78 x 91) / (44 x 91) = 7128 / 4004
* 17/91 = (17 x 44) / (91 x 44) = 748 / 4004

Finally, we add the fractions:

* 7128/4004 + 748/4004 = (7128 + 748) / 4004 = 7876/4004

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4:

* 7876/4004 = (7876/4) / (4004/4) = 1969/1001

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for all three fractions. The least common multiple of 4 and 79 is 316. 

* To convert 43/4, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 79: (43/4) * (79/79) = 3407/316
* To convert 71/4, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 79: (71/4) * (79/79) = 5629/316
* To convert 92/79, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 4: (92/79) * (4/4) = 368/316

Now we can add the fractions:

3407/316 + 5629/316 + 368/316 = (3407 + 5629 + 368)/316 = 9404/316

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4:

This fraction can be simplified.  Since both 2404 and 553 are divisible by 7, we have:

2404/553 = (2404/7) / (553/7) = 343 4/7

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 79 and 38 is 3002.

*  We multiply the numerator and denominator of 60/79 by 38: (60 * 38) / (79 * 38) = 2280/3002
*  We multiply the numerator and denominator of 53/38 by 79: (53 * 79) / (38 * 79) = 4197/3002

Now we can add the fractions: 2280/3002 + 4197/3002 = (2280 + 4197) / 3002 = 6477/3002

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of two fractions, they need to have the same denominator. We can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, 75 and 58.

The LCM of 75 and 58 is 4350.

Now, we need to convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 4350:

*  (49/75) * (58/58) = 2842/4350
*  (88/58) * (75/75) = 6600/4350

Now we can add the fractions:

2842/4350 + 6600/4350 = 9442/4350

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

9442/4350 = (9442/2)/(4350/2) = 4721/2175

Therefore, the sum of 49/75 and 88/58 is 4721/2175.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know the sum of 49/75 and 88/58 is 4721/2175.  Now we need to add 3/82 to this sum.

To do this, we need to find a common denominator for all three fractions. The LCM of 2175, 82, and the previous denominator of 4350 (used to add the first two fractions) is 178350.

Let's convert each fraction:

* (4721/2175) * (82/82) = 387002/178350
* (3/82) * (2175/2175) = 6525/178350

Now we can add all three fractions:

387002/178350 + 6525/178350 + 6600/4350 = 393527/178350

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1:

393527/178350 = 393527/178350

Therefore, the sum of 49/75, 88/58, and 3/82 is 393527/178350.

Let's convert the fractions:

* (12/75) * (58/58) = 696/4350
* (88/58) * (75/75) = 6600/4350

Now we can add:

696/4350 + 6600/4350 = 7296/4350

Simplifying by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 4:

7296/4350 = (7296/4) / (4350/4) = 1824/1087.5

Therefore, the sum of 12/75 and 88/58 is 1824/1087.5

        <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we simplify each fraction:

* 57/22 is already in its simplest form.
* 72/48 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 24. This gives us 3/2.

Now we have: (57/22) - (3/2)

To subtract fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common denominator of 22 and 2 is 22.  We convert 3/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 22:

* (3/2) * (11/11) = 33/22

Now we can subtract:

(57/22) - (33/22) = (57-33)/22 = 24/22

Finally, we simplify 24/22 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 2:

* (24/2) / (22/2) = 12/11

            Originally, you calculated the result of (57 / 22) - (72 / 48) and expressed your answer as a fraction in the simplest form. Now, consider the scenario where you miscalculated and the second fraction was actually (72 / 100) instead of (72 / 48). Recalculate the expression (57 / 22) - (72 / 100). What is the final simplified fraction in this case?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's recalculate the expression with the corrected second fraction:

(57/22) - (72/100)

We can simplify 72/100 by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 4:

(72/100) = (18/25)

Now we need to find the least common denominator of 22 and 25. The least common denominator is 550.  We convert each fraction to have a denominator of 550:

* (57/22) * (25/25) = 1425/550
* (18/25) * (22/22) = 396/550

Now we can subtract:

(1425/550) - (396/550) = (1425-396)/550 = 1029/550

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 9:

(1029/9) / (550/9) = 114/61

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know that the sum of 37/69 and 67/61 is 6880/4209.  

Now, to add 100/7 to this sum, we need to find a common denominator for all three fractions. The least common multiple of 4209, 7, and 1 is 4209. 

* We already have 6880/4209.
* We multiply the numerator and denominator of 100/7 by 601 to get (100 * 601) / (7 * 601) = 60100/4209.

Now we can add all three fractions: 6880/4209 + 60100/4209 = (6880 + 60100) / 4209 = 66980/4209.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator.  We'll find the least common multiple (LCM) of 78 and 83:

* 78 = 2 x 3 x 13
* 83 is a prime number

The LCM of 78 and 83 is 78 x 83 = 6474.

Now, we'll convert each fraction:

* 51/78 = (51 x 83) / (78 x 83) = 4233 / 6474
* 44/83 = (44 x 78) / (83 x 78) = 3432 / 6474

Finally, we can add the fractions:

* 4233/6474 + 3432/6474 = (4233 + 3432) / 6474 = 7665 / 6474

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1:

Now we can add:

The LCM of 74 and 83 is 74 x 83 = 6142.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Simplify the fractions:**
   * 33 / 23 is already in its simplest form.
   * 12 / 75 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3: 12/75 = 4/25

2. **Find a common denominator:**
   * The least common denominator for 23 and 25 is 23 * 25 = 575

3. **Rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:**
   * (33 / 23) * (25 / 25) = 825 / 575
   * (4 / 25) * (23 / 23) = 92 / 575

4. **Subtract the fractions:**
   * (825 / 575) - (92 / 575) = (825 - 92) / 575

5. **Simplify the result:**
   * (825 - 92) / 575 = 733 / 575

Now, let's add 24 / 81:

1. **Simplify 24 / 81:**
   * Both 24 and 81 are divisible by 3, so we can simplify: 24/81 = 8/27

2. **Find a common denominator for 575 and 27:**
   * The least common denominator is 575 * 27 = 15525

3. **Rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:**
   * (733 / 575) * (27 / 27) = 19761 / 15525
   * (8 / 27) * (575 / 575) = 4600 / 15525

4. **Add the fractions:**
   * (19761 / 15525) + (4600 / 15525) = (19761 + 4600) / 15525

5. **Simplify the result:**

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they must have a common denominator.  The least common denominator of 30 and 77 is their product, 2310.

* $\frac{75}{77} = \frac{75 \cdot 30}{77 \cdot 30} = \frac{2250}{2310}$

Now we can add the fractions:

$\frac{1463}{2310} + \frac{2250}{2310} = \frac{1463 + 2250}{2310} = \frac{3713}{2310}$

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 13:

We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 66 and 64, which is 2112.

*  To get a denominator of 2112 for 49/64, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 33: (49 * 33) / (64 * 33) = 1617/2112

Now we can add the fractions: 1824/2112 + 1617/2112 = (1824 + 1617)/2112 = 3441/2112

1. **Original calculation:** (55/30) - (1/72) = 131/72 

2. **New calculation:** (80/30) - (1/72)

3. **Simplifying the first fraction:** 80/30 simplifies to 8/3.

4. **Finding a common denominator:** The least common denominator for 8/3 and 1/72 is 72.

   -  8/3 * (24/24) = 192/72

5. **Subtracting the fractions:** (192/72) - (1/72) = 191/72

**Comparing the results:**

- The original result was 131/72.
- The new result is 191/72.

**Conclusion:**  Increasing the numerator of the first fraction from 55 to 80  **increases** the overall result of the operation. The difference between the new and original results is 60/72, which simplifies to 5/6.

### Answer: The result will increase by 5/6.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they must have the same denominator.  We find the least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 86.

The prime factorization of 21 is $3\times7$, and the prime factorization of 86 is $2\times43$.  Their LCM is $2\times3\times7\times43=1806$.

We can rewrite our fractions with the denominator 1806:

$\frac{69}{21}=\frac{69\times86}{21\times86}=\frac{5934}{1806}$

$\frac{71}{86}=\frac{71\times21}{86\times21}=\frac{1491}{1806}$

Now we add the fractions:

$\frac{5934}{1806}+\frac{1491}{1806}=\frac{5934+1491}{1806}=\frac{7425}{1806}$

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We found that the sum of $\frac{69}{21}$ and $\frac{71}{86}$ is $\frac{7425}{1806}$.  Now we need to add $\frac{86}{62}$ to this.  First, we need to find a common denominator.

The prime factorization of 1806 is $2\times3\times7\times43$, and the prime factorization of 62 is $2\times31$.  The least common multiple is $2\times3\times7\times31\times43=54942$.  

We can rewrite our fractions with this denominator:

$\frac{7425}{1806}=\frac{7425\times31}{1806\times31}=\frac{230075}{54942}$

$\frac{86}{62}=\frac{86\times882}{62\times882}=\frac{75972}{54942}$

Now we add the fractions:

$\frac{230075}{54942}+\frac{75972}{54942}=\frac{230075+75972}{54942}=\frac{306047}{54942}$

The prime factorization of 60 is $2^2\times3\times5$, and the prime factorization of 86 is $2\times43$.  Their LCM is $2^2\times3\times5\times43=2580$.

We can rewrite our fractions with the denominator 2580:

$\frac{69}{60}=\frac{69\times43}{60\times43}=\frac{2967}{2580}$

$\frac{71}{86}=\frac{71\times30}{86\times30}=\frac{2130}{2580}$

Now we add the fractions:

Now we can add the fractions:

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4:

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Following the last problem where you added 47/16 and 96/10, let's consider a slightly different scenario: What if you were to add 47/16 and 64/10 instead? What would be the sum?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Following the same process as before, we need to find a common denominator for 16 and 10. The least common multiple is 80.

* Convert 47/16 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 80: (47/16) * (5/5) = 235/80
* Convert 64/10 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 80: (64/10) * (8/8) = 512/80

Now we can add the fractions:

235/80 + 512/80 = 747/80

To express this as a mixed number:

747/80 = 9 27/80

            What is the sum of 26/90 and 50/26 when calculated as a fraction?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator.  We find the least common multiple (LCM) of 90 and 26:

* Factors of 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90
* Factors of 26: 1, 2, 13, 26
* LCM of 90 and 26: 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 13 = 1170

Now we rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 1170:

* (26/90) * (13/13) = 338/1170
* (50/26) * (45/45) = 2250/1170

Finally, we add the fractions:

* 338/1170 + 2250/1170 = 2588/1170

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 2:

* 2588/1170 = (2 * 1294) / (2 * 585) = 1294/585

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know the sum of 26/90 and 50/26 is 1294/585.  Now we need to subtract 92/89 from that.

To subtract fractions, they need a common denominator. The LCM of 585 and 89 is 52065.

* (1294/585) * (89/89) = 115066/52065
* (92/89) * (585/585) = 53820/52065

Now we can subtract:

* 115066/52065 - 53820/52065 = 61246/52065

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their GCF, which is 2:

* 61246/52065 = (2 * 30623) / (2 * 26032.5) = 30623/26032.5

            After calculating the sum of 26/90 and 50/26, suppose instead you added 26/90 and 50/38. How would the result change? Please give the answer as a simplified fraction.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's first find the sum of 26/90 and 50/38. 

* The LCM of 90 and 38 is 1710.
* (26/90) * (19/19) = 494/1710
* (50/38) * (45/45) = 2250/1710
* 494/1710 + 2250/1710 = 2744/1710

Simplifying, we get: 2744/1710 = (2 * 1372) / (2 * 855) = 1372/855

Now, let's compare this result to the previous sum (1294/585):

* 1294/585 is greater than 1372/855 because the numerator and denominator are both smaller.

Therefore, adding 26/90 and 50/38 results in a **smaller** sum than adding 26/90 and 50/26.

### Answer: The result would be smaller.

1. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators:**  The LCM of 98 and 82 is 4006.

2. **Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCM as the denominator:**
   * 80/98 = (80 * 41) / (98 * 41) = 3280/4006
   * 92/82 = (92 * 49) / (82 * 49) = 4508/4006

3. **Add the numerators:** 3280/4006 + 4508/4006 = 7788/4006

4. **Simplify the result (if possible):**  Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2, so we get 3894/2003.

* **Convert 69/5:** Multiply both numerator and denominator by 44: (69 * 44) / (5 * 44) = 3036/220

Now we can add the fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know that 54/1 + 62/30 = 841/15.

Now we need to subtract 53/41 from this result.

* **Find a common denominator:**
    * The least common multiple of 15 and 41 is 615.
    * (841/15) * (41/41) = 34521/615
    * (53/41) * (15/15) = 795/615

* **Subtract the fractions:**
    * 34521/615 - 795/615 = 33726/615

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Simplify the fraction:** 62/30 simplifies to 31/15 (divide both numerator and denominator by 2).

* **Add the whole number and the fraction:**
   * 93 + 31/15

* **Find a common denominator:**
   * 93 can be written as (93 * 15)/15 = 1395/15
   * Now we have 1395/15 + 31/15 = 1426/15

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator.  The least common multiple of 29 and 7 is 203.

* **Convert 85/29:**  Multiply the numerator and denominator by 7: (85 * 7) / (29 * 7) = 595/203
* **Convert 47/7:** Multiply the numerator and denominator by 29: (47 * 29) / (7 * 29) = 1363/203

Now we can add the fractions:

595/203 + 1363/203 = (595 + 1363) / 203 = 1958/203

            After finding the result of adding 85/29 and 47/7, what is the new total if you also add 81/42?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know that 85/29 + 47/7 = 1958/203.  

Now we need to add 81/42 to that result.  First, we need a common denominator:

* **Find the least common multiple of 203 and 42:** The least common multiple is 2682.
* **Convert 1958/203:** Multiply numerator and denominator by 13: (1958 * 13) / (203 * 13) = 25454/2682
* **Convert 81/42:** Multiply numerator and denominator by 64: (81 * 64) / (42 * 64) = 5184/2682

Now we can add:

25454/2682 + 5184/2682 = (25454 + 5184) / 2682 = 30638/2682

            After calculating the result from the previous problem, consider a new situation: You have now 85/64 of a pound of oranges and 47/7 pounds of apples. What is the new total weight of your fruits in pounds?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total weight, we need to add the weight of the oranges and the weight of the apples. 

* **Oranges:** 85/64 pounds
* **Apples:** 47/7 pounds

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 64 and 7 is 448.

* **Convert 85/64:** Multiply the numerator and denominator by 7: (85 * 7) / (64 * 7) = 595/448
* **Convert 47/7:** Multiply the numerator and denominator by 64: (47 * 64) / (7 * 64) = 3008/448

Now we can add the fractions:

595/448 + 3008/448 = (595 + 3008) / 448 = 3603/448
