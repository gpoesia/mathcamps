        A triangle has a perimeter of 513 km, and it's known to be an equilateral triangle - meaning all three sides are of equal length. Can you determine how long each side of this triangle is?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this:

* **Perimeter:** The perimeter of a triangle is the total length of all its sides added together.
* **Equilateral Triangle:**  In an equilateral triangle, all three sides are the same length.

Since the perimeter is 513 km, and we have three equal sides, we can find the length of each side by dividing the perimeter by 3:

513 km / 3 = 171 km

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides.  

Let's represent the unknown side by the variable &quot;x&quot;.

We know: 
- Perimeter = 773 cm
- Side 1 = 37 cm
- Side 2 = 559 cm

Therefore, the equation is: 37 cm + 559 cm + x = 773 cm

Combining the known sides: 596 cm + x = 773 cm

To isolate &quot;x&quot;, we subtract 596 cm from both sides: x = 773 cm - 596 cm

Finally, we find the length of the third side: x = 177 cm

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. We know two sides are 350m and 154m, so their combined length is 350m + 154m = 504m.
To find the length of the third side, we subtract the combined length of the two known sides from the total perimeter: 919m - 504m = 415m.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to calculate the length of the third side:

1. **Perimeter Formula:** The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. So, Perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3.

2. **Substitute Known Values:** We know the perimeter (762 meters) and two sides (122 meters and 245 meters).  Let the unknown side be represented by 'x'. 
   Therefore, 762 = 122 + 245 + x

3. **Solve for 'x':**
   * Combine the known side lengths: 762 = 367 + x
   * Subtract 367 from both sides: 762 - 367 = x
   * Calculate the result: 395 = x

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 395 meters.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length.  Since the perimeter is the total length of all sides, we can find the length of one side by dividing the perimeter by 3.

The length of each side is 246 centimeters / 3 = 82 centimeters.
