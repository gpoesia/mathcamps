            There are 535 fish in a large tank and a shark eats 461 of them in one sitting. If the shark continues this pattern and only eats when there are 461 or more fish to consume, how many fish will be leftover after its dinner?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find the difference between the initial number of fish and the number the shark eats. 
535 - 461 = 74
This means that 74 fish are left after the shark eats.
The shark can't eat the remaining fish because there are less than 461 fish left.

            A baker baked a total of 928 cookies. He decided to distribute equal amounts of cookies to 186 orphanages. After giving out as many entire sets of cookies as possible to each orphanage, how many cookies does the baker have left?

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many cookies the baker can give to each orphanage, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of orphanages: 928 cookies / 186 orphanages = 4.98 cookies per orphanage. Since the baker can only give out whole cookies, each orphanage receives 4 cookies. The baker gave out a total of 4 cookies/orphanage * 186 orphanages = 744 cookies. The baker has 928 cookies - 744 cookies = 184 cookies left.

            In the previously mentioned scenario, consider that the baker only baked 173 cookies instead of 928. He still plans on distributing equal amounts of cookies to the 186 orphanages. After giving out as many full sets as possible to each orphanage, how many cookies will the baker have left over this time?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Since the baker has fewer cookies than orphanages, he can only give out one cookie to each orphanage. He will give out a total of 1 cookie/orphanage * 186 orphanages = 186 cookies. 
He will then have 173 cookies - 186 cookies = -13 cookies. Since he can't have negative cookies, he'll have no cookies left over, and he'll be short 13 cookies.

            A pizza store has 975 slices of pizza ready to serve. If each pizza box can contain 196 slices, how many left over slices will there be after all the pizza boxes are full?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find out how many slices of pizza fit into the boxes, so we divide the total slices by the capacity of each box: 975 / 196 = 4.97 (approximately). Since we can only have whole boxes, we know that 4 boxes will be full. To find out how many slices are left over, we multiply the number of full boxes by the capacity of each box and subtract that from the total slices: 4 * 196 = 784, and 975 - 784 = 191.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">This problem requires us to find the remainder after dividing the total number of stones by the number of stones needed per creature.

We need to know how many creatures the wizard has summoned to determine the remainder.  

Let's say the wizard summoned 'x' creatures.  He would use 193 * x stones for those creatures.

To find the remaining stones, we would subtract the stones used from the total stones: 932 - (193 * x)

**We need the number of creatures summoned ('x') to calculate the remaining stones.**

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, find out how many full containers the company can fill: 473 gallons / 22 gallons/container = 21 containers with some juice left over.
Then, multiply the number of full containers by the size of each container to find out how much juice is used: 21 containers * 22 gallons/container = 462 gallons.

To find out how many cars are left unpacked, we multiply the number of cars per box by the number of boxes filled and then subtract that from the total number of cars: 9 boxes * 108 cars/box = 972 cars.  979 cars - 972 cars = 7 cars left unpacked.

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Each bottle can hold 193 / 167 = 1.15 liters of water.
To figure out how much overflows, multiply the amount each bottle holds by the number of bottles: 1.15 * 167 = 192.55 liters.
Subtract this amount from the total water: 193 - 192.55 = 0.45 liters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many rows the dragon can fill completely, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per row: 996 / 319 = 3 rows with a remainder. 

To find the remainder, we multiply the number of full rows by the number of eggs per row and subtract that from the total number of eggs: 3 * 319 = 957, and 996 - 957 = 39.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many blasts Blast Man can fire, we divide his total energy units by the energy units per blast: 338 energy units / 16 energy units/blast = 21.125 blasts.  Since Blast Man can't fire a fraction of a blast, he can fire a maximum of 21 blasts.

To find out how many energy units he'll have left, we multiply the number of blasts by the energy used per blast and subtract that from his total energy units: 21 blasts * 16 energy units/blast = 336 energy units used.

Then we subtract that from his total energy units: 338 energy units - 336 energy units = 2 energy units left.

            Now, imagine that Superhero Blast Man has boosted his power cells and now has 338 energy units in his power cells. But this time, each energy blast he fires now uses 46 energy units.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We'll follow the same process as before:

1. **Calculate the maximum number of blasts:** 338 energy units / 46 energy units/blast = 7.348 blasts. Since Blast Man can't fire a fraction of a blast, he can fire a maximum of 7 blasts.

2. **Calculate the total energy used:** 7 blasts * 46 energy units/blast = 322 energy units used.

3. **Calculate the remaining energy:** 338 energy units - 322 energy units = 16 energy units left.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to find out how many buses are needed: 530 students / 144 students/bus = 3.68 buses. Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to 4 buses.  Now, we need to find how many students are on the first three buses: 3 buses * 144 students/bus = 432 students. Finally, we find the number of students on the last bus: 530 students - 432 students = 98 students.

We do this by dividing the total number of unicorns by the number of sections: 265 unicorns / 146 sections = 1.81 unicorns per section (approximately). Since we can't have parts of unicorns, each complete section has 1 unicorn. 

We then multiply the number of complete sections by the number of unicorns per section to find the number of unicorns in the complete sections: 145 sections * 1 unicorn/section = 145 unicorns. 

Finally, we subtract the number of unicorns in the complete sections from the total number of unicorns to find the number in the last incomplete section: 265 unicorns - 145 unicorns = 120 unicorns.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many jugs can be filled, we divide the total gallons of milk by the capacity of each jug: 913 gallons / 39 gallons/jug = 23.41 jugs. Since we can't have a fraction of a jug, we know that 23 jugs will be filled completely. 
To find the leftover milk, we multiply the number of filled jugs by the jug capacity and subtract that from the total milk produced: 23 jugs * 39 gallons/jug = 897 gallons. 
913 gallons - 897 gallons = 16 gallons.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many jugs can be filled, we divide the total gallons of milk by the capacity of each jug: 913 gallons / 230 gallons/jug = 3.97 jugs. Since we can't have a fraction of a jug, we know that 3 jugs will be filled completely. 
To find the leftover milk, we multiply the number of filled jugs by the jug capacity and subtract that from the total milk produced: 3 jugs * 230 gallons/jug = 690 gallons. 
913 gallons - 690 gallons = 223 gallons.

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find the remainder when 694 is divided by 578. We can do this using long division or by recognizing that 694 is only slightly larger than 578.

694 - 578 = 116. 

Since 116 is greater than 578, we know that there is at least one more box needed. 

116 - 578 = -462.  This negative result means we need to subtract one box.

Therefore, 116 - 578 = -462  means there is only 116 left over.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  The factory needs 820/684 = &lt;&lt;820/684=1.198&gt;&gt; 1.198 storage units to store all the robots. Since you can't have parts of a storage unit, the factory needs 2 storage units. This means they can store 2*684 = &lt;&lt;2*684=1368&gt;&gt; 1368 robots in the storage units.  This leaves 820 - 1368 = &lt;&lt;820 - 1368=-548&gt;&gt; -548 robots outside. Since we can't have a negative number of robots, this tells us that all the robots can fit in the storage units.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To figure out how many cycles the cloud goes through, we divide the initial number of droplets by the number of droplets lost per cycle: 516 droplets / 289 droplets/cycle = 1.78 cycles. Since we can't have a fraction of a cycle, the cloud goes through 1 complete cycle. 

After the first cycle, the cloud loses 289 droplets.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to find the largest multiple of 183 that is less than 649. Dividing 649 by 183, we get approximately 3.55. This means that 3 crates can be filled completely.  
 
 To find the remaining potatoes, we multiply the number of full crates by the number of potatoes per crate, and then subtract that amount from the total number of potatoes harvested: 3 crates * 183 potatoes/crate = 549 potatoes. 
 
 Finally, we subtract the number of potatoes in full crates from the total number of potatoes: 649 potatoes - 549 potatoes = 100 potatoes.

Now, to find out how many carrots are left unpacked, we multiply the number of carrots per box by the number of full boxes packed and subtract that from the total number of carrots: 244 carrots/box * 1 box = 244 carrots.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many penguins are left over, we need to see how many times 293 goes into 309.  
309 divided by 293 is approximately 1.05. 
Since we can't have a partial penguin, we know that there was 1 group of 293 penguins. 
To find the number of penguins in the final group, we subtract the number of penguins in the full group from the total: 309 - 293 = 16

309 divided by 262 is approximately 1.18.  
Again, since we can't have a partial penguin, there was 1 group of 262 penguins.
To find the number of penguins in the final group, we subtract the number of penguins in the full group from the total: 309 - 262 = 47

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how much fabric is left over, we need to figure out how much fabric is used to make dresses.
We divide the total fabric by the fabric needed per dress: 925 meters / 529 meters/dress = 1.75 dresses.
Since we can't make parts of dresses, the tailor can make only 1 dress.
The amount of fabric left over is 925 meters - 529 meters = 396 meters.
