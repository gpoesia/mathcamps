            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We need to divide the new total number of ice skates by the number of stores to find out how many each store will receive. 
So, we have 3887 ice skates / 38 stores = 102.5 ice skates per store. 
Since you can't have half an ice skate, we round down to the nearest whole number.

            Let's consider that our dragon, instead of collecting 3010 jewels over 43 years, increased his hoard to 6402 jewels over the same period. If the dragon collected at an even pace throughout these years, how many jewels did he collect each year now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many jewels the dragon collected each year, we need to divide the total number of jewels by the number of years.  

So, the dragon collected 6402 / 43 = &lt;&lt;6402/43=149&gt;&gt;149 jewels each year.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We can use the same logic as before, dividing the total number of signals by the number of days.  This gives us 6699 signals / 2715 days = &lt;&lt;6699/2715=2.47&gt;&gt; 2.47 signals per day.

However, since the spaceship can't send a fraction of a signal, we can conclude that it sends **2 signals** each day.  The remaining portion of a signal is likely part of a longer pattern that repeats over multiple days.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            The slide in the amusement park is being redesigned, and its new length is 3769 inches. The waves are still placed every 56 inches. How many waves will the redesigned slide have now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of waves on the redesigned slide, we divide the new length of the slide by the length of each wave.

So, we calculate 3769 inches / 56 inches/wave = &lt;&lt;3769/56=67.3035714286&gt;&gt; 67.3035714286 waves.

Since we can't have a fraction of a wave, we round down to the nearest whole number.

### Answer: 67
