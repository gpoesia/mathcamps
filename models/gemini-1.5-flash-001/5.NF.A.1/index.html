    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators:**

* The denominators are 56, 23, and 26.
* The LCM of these numbers is 8008.

**2. Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCM as the denominator:**

* 48/56 = (48 * 143) / (56 * 143) = 6864/8008
* 95/23 = (95 * 348) / (23 * 348) = 33060/8008
* 34/26 = (34 * 308) / (26 * 308) = 10472/8008

**3. Add the first two fractions:**

* 6864/8008 + 33060/8008 = 39924/8008

**4. Subtract the third fraction:**

* 39924/8008 - 10472/8008 = 29452/8008

**5. Simplify the result:**

* Both the numerator and denominator can be divided by 8.
* 29452/8008 = (29452/8) / (8008/8) = 3681/1001

**Therefore, the value John found for the operation is 3681/1001.**

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator.  The least common multiple of 41 and 77 is 3167. We can rewrite the fractions as:

* 71/41 = (71 * 77) / (41 * 77) = 5487 / 3167
* 41/77 = (41 * 41) / (77 * 41) = 1681 / 3167

Now we can add the fractions:

* 5487/3167 + 1681/3167 = (5487 + 1681)/3167 = 7168/3167

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1:

* 7168/3167 = (7168 / 1) / (3167 / 1) = 7168/3167

* **56/35:** Multiply numerator and denominator by 26: (56 * 26) / (35 * 26) = 1456/910

Now we can add the fractions:
140/910 + 1456/910 = (140 + 1456)/910 = 1596/910

Now we can add the fractions:

* Multiply 11382/3807 by 71/71: (11382/3807) * (71/71) = 808242/269857
* Multiply 52/71 by 3807/3807: (52/71) * (3807/3807) = 197964/269857

   * 78 / 59 = 1.322 (approximately)

2. **Addition:** Now we add the results of the two fractions.

* 48/50 = (48*28)/(50*28) = 1344/1400

Now we can add: 2225/1400 + 1344/1400 = (2225+1344)/1400 = 3569/1400

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 11.

3569/1400 = (3569/11) / (1400/11) = 324.45/127.27

        After finding the sum of 89/56 and 48/50, add the result to 2/65. What is the final simplified fraction?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know the sum of 89/56 and 48/50 is 3569/1400. Now we need to add 2/65 to this result. 

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1400 and 65 is 18200.

* 3569/1400 = (3569*13)/(1400*13) = 46397/18200
* 2/65 = (2*280)/(65*280) = 560/18200

Now we can add: 46397/18200 + 560/18200 = (46397 + 560)/18200 = 46957/18200

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 11.

46957/18200 = (46957/11) / (18200/11) = 4269/1655

        Suppose in the original problem, instead of having 89/12, we only have 89/12, and the number of parts out of 50 remain the same. So, what is the sum of 89/12 and 48/50 this time? Answer as a simplified fraction.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 12 and 50 is 300.
* 89/12 = (89*25)/(12*25) = 2225/300
* 48/50 = (48*6)/(50*6) = 288/300

Now we can add: 2225/300 + 288/300 = (2225+288)/300 = 2513/300

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1.

        What is the result when you subtract 38/87 from the sum of 96/11 and 12/5? Please leave your answer as a fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find the sum of 96/11 and 12/5. To do this, we need a common denominator:

* The least common multiple of 11 and 5 is 55.
* 96/11 * (5/5) = 480/55
* 12/5 * (11/11) = 132/55

Now we add the two fractions:

* 480/55 + 132/55 = 612/55

Finally, we subtract 38/87 from the sum:

* To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 55 and 87 is 4785.
* 612/55 * (87/87) = 53244/4785
* 38/87 * (55/55) = 2090/4785

Now we can subtract:

        After considering the fruit you have, suppose you actually started off with a fraction of the fruits, having 96/58 oranges, and still having 12/5 apples. If you subtracted 38/87 of your total fruits for charity, what fraction of fruits would you have left? Please leave your answer as a fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Find the total initial fraction of fruits:** 
   * Add the fractions of oranges and apples: 96/58 + 12/5 = (96*5 + 12*58) / (58*5) = 912/290

2. **Calculate the fraction of fruits donated:** 
   * Multiply the total initial fraction by 38/87: (912/290) * (38/87) = 3456/25230

3. **Subtract the donated fraction from the initial fraction:**
   * 912/290 - 3456/25230 = (912*87 - 3456*290) / (290*87) = -73920/25230

4. **Simplify the result (if possible):**
   * The fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 18480. 
   * (-73920 / 18480) / (25230 / 18480) = -4/13.5

**Important Note:** You can't have a negative fraction of fruits. This result suggests that the amount donated was more than the total initial amount of fruits.  There might be an error in the problem setup. 

**Assuming the problem meant to subtract 38/87 of the *oranges* for charity, we can solve as follows:**

1. **Calculate the fraction of oranges donated:**
   * (96/58) * (38/87) = 1536/4761

2. **Subtract the donated oranges from the initial oranges:**
   * 96/58 - 1536/4761 = (96*87 - 1536*58) / (58*87) = -63360/5046

3. **Simplify the fraction:**
   * (-63360 / 18480) / (5046 / 18480) = -3.5/2.75

4. **Add the remaining apples to find the total fraction left:**
   * -3.5/2.75 + 12/5 = (-3.5*5 + 12*2.75) / (2.75*5) = 16.5/13.75

5. **Simplify the fraction:**
   * (16.5/13.75) = (33/27.5) = (66/55)

3. **Subtract the second division from the first:** (82/9) - (82/63)

4. **Find a common denominator:** The least common denominator of 9 and 63 is 63.  To get a denominator of 63 for the first fraction, multiply both numerator and denominator by 7: (82/9) * (7/7) = 574/63.

5. **Subtract the fractions:** (574/63) - (82/63) = (574-82)/63 = 492/63.

        Calculate the value of 23/3 minus the sum of 80/91 and 26/24. Answer as a simple fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for 80/91 and 26/24. The least common multiple of 91 and 24 is 2184.

* 80/91 * (24/24) = 1920/2184
* 26/24 * (91/91) = 2366/2184

Now we can add these fractions: 1920/2184 + 2366/2184 = 4286/2184

Next, we simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2: 4286/2184 = 2143/1092

Now we can subtract this simplified fraction from 23/3: 23/3 - 2143/1092

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator:

* 23/3 * (364/364) = 8382/1092
* 2143/1092 stays the same

Now we can subtract: 8382/1092 - 2143/1092 = 6239/1092

Finally, we simplify this fraction: 6239/1092 = 2079/364

* (30/11) + (36/19) = (30 * 19 / 11 * 19) + (36 * 11 / 19 * 11) = (570 / 209) + (396 / 209) = (966 / 209)

**3. Add the result to (81/34):**

* Find a common denominator for 209 and 34. The least common denominator is 7086.
* (966 / 209) + (81 / 34) = (966 * 34 / 209 * 34) + (81 * 209 / 34 * 209) = (32844 / 7086) + (16929 / 7086) = (49773 / 7086)

**4. Simplify the final fraction:**

* The greatest common factor of 49773 and 7086 is 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Simplify the fractions:**
   - (64 / 34) can be simplified to (32 / 17) by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2.
   - (3 / 24) can be simplified to (1 / 8) by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3.

2. **Find a common denominator for (32 / 17) and (1 / 8):**
   - The least common multiple of 17 and 8 is 136.
   - Convert (32 / 17) to (256 / 136) by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 8.
   - Convert (1 / 8) to (17 / 136) by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 17.

3. **Add the fractions:**
   - (256 / 136) + (17 / 136) = (273 / 136)

4. **Find a common denominator for (273 / 136) and (41 / 96):**

        Daniel has to solve a math problem for his homework that includes fractions. Initially, he has been asked to add 83/73 and 53/77. The result of this step he saved as 'w'. Then, he needs to add 80/76 to the result 'w'. How would he calculate the final answer in simplified fraction form?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how Daniel can calculate the final answer in simplified fraction form:

**Step 1: Add the first two fractions**

* Find a common denominator for 73 and 77. The least common multiple is 5621.
* Convert the fractions:
    * 83/73 * (77/77) = 6391/5621
    * 53/77 * (73/73) = 3869/5621
* Add the fractions: 6391/5621 + 3869/5621 = 10260/5621 
* This is the value of 'w'.

**Step 2: Add 80/76 to 'w'**

* Find a common denominator for 5621 and 76. The least common multiple is 426876.
* Convert the fractions:
    * 10260/5621 * (76/76) = 779760/426876
    * 80/76 * (5621/5621) = 449680/426876
* Add the fractions: 779760/426876 + 449680/426876 = 1229440/426876

**Step 3: Simplify the result**

* Find the greatest common factor (GCD) of 1229440 and 426876.  The GCD is 15368.
* Divide both numerator and denominator by 15368:
    * (1229440 / 15368) / (426876 / 15368) = 80/28

**Step 4: Further simplification**

* The fraction 80/28 can be further simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4:
    * (80 / 4) / (28 / 4) = 20/7

        Add the following fractions and simplify your answer: 27/20 and 14/66.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator.  We find the least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 66:

* Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
* Factors of 66: 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, 66

The LCM of 20 and 66 is 660.

Now, we rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 660:

* (27/20) * (33/33) = 891/660
* (14/66) * (10/10) = 140/660

Finally, we add the fractions:

* 891/660 + 140/660 = (891 + 140)/660 = 1031/660

This fraction can be simplified by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of 1031 and 660.  The GCF is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.

* (1031/660) * (3/3) = 3093/1980
* (58/18) * (110/110) = 6380/1980

Now we can add:

* 3093/1980 + 6380/1980 = (3093 + 6380)/1980 = 9473/1980

This fraction can be simplified by finding the GCF of 9473 and 1980.  The GCF is 33.  Dividing both numerator and denominator by 33:

* (27/20) * (41/41) = 1107/820
* (14/41) * (20/20) = 280/820

Finally, we add the fractions:

(16/7) * (47/47) = 752/329
(22/47) * (7/7) = 154/329

Finally, we subtract the fractions:

(71/14) * (47/47) = 3337/658
(22/47) * (14/14) = 308/658

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they must have a common denominator.  We find the least common multiple (LCM) of 61 and 53.  Since 61 and 53 are both prime numbers, their LCM is their product: 61 * 53 = 3233.

Now we rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 3233:

* (74/61) * (53/53) = 3922/3233
* (41/53) * (61/61) = 2501/3233

Finally, we add the numerators:

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors: 2³ * 11 * 61 = 5368

* 44/87 * 34/34 = 1496/2958

Now we can add the two fractions: 2088/2958 + 1496/2958 = 3584/2958

Next, we need to add 14/89 to this sum. Again, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2958 and 89 is 263462.

Now we can add the two fractions: 318976/263462 + 41412/263462 = 360388/263462

Finally, we can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions. The least common multiple of 30 and 60 is 60. 

* We can rewrite 73/30 as (73 * 2) / (30 * 2) = 146/60

Now we can add the fractions:

* 146/60 + 8/60 = (146 + 8) / 60 = 154/60

Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

* 154/60 = (154 / 2) / (60 / 2) = 77/30

        Suppose you have the following three fractions: 82/49, 45/60, and 99/59. 

If you add the first fraction (82/49) with the second one (45/60), call this result 'd'. Then, add 'd' to the third fraction (99/59). 

What would be the resulting sum? Please provide your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Simplify the second fraction:** 45/60 simplifies to 3/4 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 15.

2. **Find a common denominator for the first two fractions:** The least common denominator for 49 and 4 is 196.
   * 82/49 becomes (82 * 4) / (49 * 4) = 328/196
   * 3/4 becomes (3 * 49) / (4 * 49) = 147/196

3. **Add the first two fractions:** 328/196 + 147/196 = 475/196

4. **Find a common denominator for 'd' and the third fraction:** The least common denominator for 196 and 59 is 11524.
   * 475/196 becomes (475 * 59) / (196 * 59) = 28075/11524
   * 99/59 becomes (99 * 196) / (59 * 196) = 19404/11524

5. **Add 'd' and the third fraction:** 28075/11524 + 19404/11524 = 47479/11524

6. **Simplify the resulting fraction:** The greatest common factor of 47479 and 11524 is 1. Therefore, the simplified fraction is **47479/11524**.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for 76/30 and 91/16. The least common multiple of 30 and 16 is 240. 
 
 76/30 = (76 * 8)/(30 * 8) = 608/240
 91/16 = (91 * 15)/(16 * 15) = 1365/240
 
 Now, we can subtract:
 
 1365/240 - 608/240 = (1365 - 608)/240 = 757/240
 
 Next, we need to add this result to 18/44. We can simplify 18/44 to 9/22. The least common multiple of 240 and 22 is 2640.
 
 757/240 = (757 * 11)/(240 * 11) = 8327/2640
 9/22 = (9 * 120)/(22 * 120) = 1080/2640
 
 Now, we can add:
 
 8327/2640 + 1080/2640 = (8327 + 1080)/2640 = 9407/2640
 
 Finally, we round 9407/2640 to the nearest hundredth:

1. **Simplify the first fraction:** 75 / 45 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 15, resulting in 5/3.

2. **Simplify the second fraction:** 5/49 is already in its simplest form.

3. **Add the first two fractions:**  (5/3) + (5/49) requires a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 49 is 147.

    * (5/49) * (3/3) = 15/147
    * Adding these: (245/147) + (15/147) = 260/147

4. **Add the third fraction:** (260/147) + (3/58) requires another common denominator. The least common multiple of 147 and 58 is 8526.

1. **Divide 93 by 34:**  93 / 34 = 2.735 (approximately)

2. **Convert the decimal to a fraction:**  2.735 can be written as 2735/1000.  We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 5: (2735/5) / (1000/5) = 547/200.

3. **Subtract the second fraction:** (547/200) - (77/74)

5. **Subtract the fractions:** (10106.5 / 3700) - (3850 / 3700) = 6256.5 / 3700

6. **Simplify the fraction:** Both the numerator and denominator are divisible by 0.5.

        What is the sum of 99/53 and 67/94 in simplest form?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator.  We find the least common multiple (LCM) of 53 and 94.  Since 53 is prime, the LCM is simply 53 * 94 = 4982.

* We multiply 99/53 by 94/94: (99/53)*(94/94) = 9306/4982
* We multiply 67/94 by 53/53: (67/94)*(53/53) = 3551/4982

Now we can add the fractions: 9306/4982 + 3551/4982 = 12857/4982

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1.  So the answer is:

        What if you were to add the fraction 50/56 to the sum you previously found (of 99/53 and 67/94)? What is the resulting value in its simplest form?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We've already determined that 99/53 + 67/94 = 12857/4982.

Now let's add 50/56 to this sum. First, we need a common denominator for all three fractions. The LCM of 4982, 53, 94, and 56 is 70148.

*  12857/4982 * (14/14) = 180000/70148
*  50/56 * (1252/1252) = 62600/70148

Now we can add all three fractions:

180000/70148 + 62600/70148 + 3551/4982 * (14/14) = 180000/70148 + 62600/70148 + 49714/70148 = 292314/70148

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator.  The least common multiple of 27 and 33 is 297.

*  We multiply 74/27 by 11/11 to get (74 * 11) / (27 * 11) = 814/297.
*  We multiply 56/33 by 9/9 to get (56 * 9) / (33 * 9) = 504/297.

Now we can subtract: 814/297 - 504/297 = (814 - 504) / 297 = 310/297.

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Find the sum of 96/40 and 11/99:**
   * Simplify 96/40:  96/40 = 24/10 = 12/5
   * Find a common denominator for 12/5 and 11/99. The least common multiple of 5 and 99 is 495.
   * Convert 12/5: (12/5) * (99/99) = 1188/495
   * Convert 11/99: (11/99) * (5/5) = 55/495
   * Add the fractions: 1188/495 + 55/495 = 1243/495

2. **Subtract 91/65 from the sum:**
   * Simplify 91/65: 91/65 = 13/5
   * Find a common denominator for 1243/495 and 13/5. The least common multiple of 495 and 5 is 495.
   * Convert 13/5: (13/5) * (99/99) = 1287/495
   * Subtract the fractions: 1243/495 - 1287/495 = -44/495

3. **Simplify the result:**
   * The fraction -44/495 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 11: 
   * -44/495 = (-4*11)/(45*11) = -4/45

2. **Find a common denominator:**
    - The least common multiple of 9 and 33 is 99. 
    - To get a denominator of 99 for 10/9, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 11: (10*11)/(9*11) = 110/99
    - To get a denominator of 99 for 1/33, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 3: (1*3)/(33*3) = 3/99

1. **Find a common denominator:**
    - The least common multiple of 99 and 62 is 6138.
    - To get a denominator of 6138 for 113/99, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 62: (113*62)/(99*62) = 7006/6138
    - To get a denominator of 6138 for 77/62, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 99: (77*99)/(62*99) = 7623/6138

2. **Add the fractions:**

2. **Find a common denominator:**
    - The least common multiple of 13 and 33 is 429.
    - To get a denominator of 429 for 30/13, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 33: (30*33)/(13*33) = 990/429.
    - To get a denominator of 429 for 1/33, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 13: (1*13)/(33*13) = 13/429.

3. **Add the fractions:**

        What is the difference between 51/34 and 12/86? Express your answer in its simplest form.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the difference, we need to subtract the smaller fraction from the larger fraction. However, to do that, they need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 34 and 86 is 172.

To get a denominator of 172 for the first fraction, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 5: 
(51/34) * (5/5) = 255/172

To get a denominator of 172 for the second fraction, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2:
(12/86) * (2/2) = 24/172

Now we can subtract the fractions: 
255/172 - 24/172 = 231/172

Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3:
231/172 = (231/3) / (172/3) = 77/57

Now we subtract:

1476/90 - 98/90 = (1476 - 98)/90 = 1378/90

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator.  We can find a common denominator by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 98 and 4. 

The LCM of 98 and 4 is 98. To get a denominator of 98 for 60/4, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 24.5:

(60/4) * (24.5/24.5) = 1470/98

Now we can add the fractions:

31/98 + 1470/98 = (31 + 1470)/98 = 1501/98

        Following the previous problem, what's the result when you subtract 41/52 from the sum of 31/98 and 60/4? Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We already know the sum of 31/98 and 60/4 is 1501/98. Now we need to subtract 41/52 from that. 

To subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator. The LCM of 98 and 52 is 2548. 

*  Multiplying 1501/98 by 26/26 (to get a denominator of 2548): (1501/98) * (26/26) = 39026/2548
*  Multiplying 41/52 by 49/49 (to get a denominator of 2548): (41/52) * (49/49) = 2009/2548

Now we can subtract:

39026/2548 - 2009/2548 = (39026 - 2009)/2548 = 37017/2548

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 13:

37017/2548 = (37017/13) / (2548/13) = 2847/196

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Similar to the previous problem, we need a common denominator. The LCM of 98 and 4 is 98.

We multiply both numerator and denominator of 83/4 by 24.5 to get a denominator of 98:

(83/4) * (24.5/24.5) = 2033.5/98

Now we can add the fractions:

31/98 + 2033.5/98 = (31 + 2033.5)/98 = 2064.5/98

To simplify, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 0.5:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Find a common denominator for 92/54 and 90/13:**
   * The least common multiple of 54 and 13 is 702.
   * Convert 92/54: (92/54) * (13/13) = 1196/702
   * Convert 90/13: (90/13) * (54/54) = 4860/702

2. **Add the fractions:**
   * (1196/702) + (4860/702) = 6056/702

3. **Simplify the fraction:**
   * Both 6056 and 702 are divisible by 4.
   * (6056/4) / (702/4) = 1514/175.5

4. **Subtract 46/41 from the result:**
   * To subtract fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 175.5 and 41 is 7200.5.
   * Convert 1514/175.5: (1514/175.5) * (41/41) = 62074/7200.5
   * Convert 46/41: (46/41) * (175.5/175.5) = 8071/7200.5
   * Subtract: (62074/7200.5) - (8071/7200.5) = 54003/7200.5

5. **Simplify the final fraction:**
   * Both 54003 and 7200.5 are divisible by 1.5.
   * (54003/1.5) / (7200.5/1.5) = 36002/4800.33333...

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Simplify each fraction:**
   * 21/75 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3: 7/25
   * 74/43 is already in its simplest form.
   * 10/62 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2: 5/31

2. **Find a common denominator for the first two fractions:**
   * The least common multiple of 25 and 43 is 1075.
   * Convert 7/25 to have a denominator of 1075: (7/25) * (43/43) = 301/1075
   * Convert 74/43 to have a denominator of 1075: (74/43) * (25/25) = 1850/1075

3. **Add the first two fractions:**
   * (301/1075) + (1850/1075) = 2151/1075

4. **Find a common denominator for the result and the third fraction:**
   * The least common multiple of 1075 and 31 is 33325
   * Convert 2151/1075 to have a denominator of 33325: (2151/1075) * (31/31) = 66681/33325
   * Convert 5/31 to have a denominator of 33325: (5/31) * (1075/1075) = 5375/33325

5. **Add the final two fractions:**
   * (66681/33325) + (5375/33325) = 72056/33325

6. **Simplify the result:**
   * Both 72056 and 33325 are divisible by 9, giving us 8006/3703.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for 53/18 and 21/99. The least common multiple of 18 and 99 is 594.

* Convert 53/18 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 594: (53/18) * (33/33) = 1749/594
* Convert 21/99 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 594: (21/99) * (6/6) = 126/594

Now, add the two fractions: 1749/594 + 126/594 = 1875/594

Since each identical fraction, t, is equal to this sum, we have:

t = 1875/594

Finally, the total sum, l, of these two fractions is:

l = t + t = 2 * (1875/594) = 3750/594

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 18:

l = (3750/18) / (594/18) = 208.333 / 33

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for 58/49 and 31/34. The least common multiple of 49 and 34 is 1666.

* (58/49) * (34/34) = 1972/1666
* (31/34) * (49/49) = 1519/1666

Now we can add the two fractions:

* 1972/1666 + 1519/1666 = 3491/1666

Next, we need to add 74/38 to this result. Again, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 1666 and 38 is 31674.

* (3491/1666) * (19/19) = 66329/31674
* (74/38) * (834/834) = 61676/31674

Now we can add the two fractions:

* 66329/31674 + 61676/31674 = 128005/31674

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1:

Now we need to add these fractions. To do that, they need to have the same denominator.  The least common multiple of 19 and 14 is 266.

*  76/77 = (76 * 86) / (77 * 86) = 6536/6622

Now, we can add the fractions:

Next, we need to simplify the fraction 8384/6622. Both the numerator and denominator are divisible by 4.

Now we can add the fractions: 450/390 + 70/390 = 520/390.

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 10: 520/390 = (520/10)/(390/10) = 52/39.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We previously found that the sum of 75/65 and 7/39 is 52/39. Now we need to add 65/97 to this. 

To add fractions, they need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 39 and 97 is 3783. 

* We can rewrite 52/39 as (52 * 97)/(39 * 97) = 5044/3783.
* We can rewrite 65/97 as (65 * 39)/(97 * 39) = 2535/3783.

Now we can add the fractions: 5044/3783 + 2535/3783 = 7579/3783.

This fraction cannot be simplified further.

        In a previous calculation, you found the sum of 75/65 and 7/39. Now, suppose we had originally used 75/65 and 7/47 instead. What would be the sum of these two fractions?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 65 and 47. Since 65 and 47 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product: 65 * 47 = 3055.

Now, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator:

* 75/65 = (75 * 47) / (65 * 47) = 3525/3055
* 7/47 = (7 * 65) / (47 * 65) = 455/3055

Finally, we add the fractions:

3525/3055 + 455/3055 = 3980/3055

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 5:

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We can simplify this problem by recognizing that we are adding the same fraction to itself.  This is equivalent to multiplying the fraction by 2. 

Therefore: (58/26) + (58/26) = 2 * (58/26) 

Now, we can simplify the fraction 58/26 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2. This gives us: 

2 * (58/26) = 2 * (29/13) 

Finally, we multiply the whole number by the numerator:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know that twice the fraction (58/26) is 58/13.  Now we need to add 49/66 to that.

To add fractions, they need to have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 13 and 66 is 858.

Let's convert each fraction to have a denominator of 858:

* (58/13) * (66/66) = 3828/858
* (49/66) * (13/13) = 637/858

Now we can add the fractions:

3828/858 + 637/858 = 4465/858

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor of 4465 and 858.  The greatest common factor is 9.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 9, we get:

4465/858 = (4465/9) / (858/9) = 496/95

        If Alex has 69/63 gallons of orange juice and he bought additional 77/5 gallons, giving him a total of 'k' gallons. Later, he received another 47/71 gallons of orange juice from Sally. How many gallons did Alex have in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to add the initial amount of orange juice Alex had to the amount he bought: 69/63 + 77/5.

To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 63 and 5 is 315.  So, we need to convert each fraction:

* (69/63) * (5/5) = 345/315
* (77/5) * (63/63) = 4851/315

Now we can add: 345/315 + 4851/315 = 5196/315

This is the total amount of orange juice Alex had after buying more.

Next, we need to add the orange juice he received from Sally: 5196/315 + 47/71

Again, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 315 and 71 is 22485.

* (5196/315) * (71/71) = 368556/22485
* (47/71) * (315/315) = 14805/22485

Now we can add: 368556/22485 + 14805/22485 = 383361/22485

This is the final amount of orange juice Alex has, which we can call 'k'.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the fractions within the parentheses:**
   - 100 / 61 = 100/61 (this fraction is already simplified)
   - 39 / 6 = 13/2 (simplifying by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3)
   - 67 / 49 = 67/49 (this fraction is already simplified)

2. **Add the fractions inside the second set of parentheses:**
   - (13/2) + (67/49) = (13 * 49) / (2 * 49) + (67 * 2) / (49 * 2) = 637/98 + 134/98 = 771/98

3. **Add the results from steps 1 and 2:**
   - (100/61) + (771/98) = (100 * 98) / (61 * 98) + (771 * 61) / (98 * 61) = 9800/5978 + 47001/5978 = 56801/5978

4. **Simplify the resulting fraction (if possible):**

        Let's reconsider the previous problem. Instead of a fraction of 67/32, consider a fraction of 43/32. Keeping the second fraction of 10/98 the same, what would be the new sum expressed as a simplified fraction?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We follow the same process as before, but with the new fraction 43/32:

1. **Find the LCM:** The LCM of 32 and 98 is still 1568.
2. **Rewrite fractions with the LCM:**
    * (43/32) * (49/49) = 2107/1568
    * (10/98) * (16/16) = 160/1568
3. **Add numerators:** 2107/1568 + 160/1568 = 2267/1568
4. **Simplify:** The greatest common factor of 2267 and 1568 is 1, so the fraction is already simplified.

        What is the sum of 59/52 and 70/32? Please provide your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they need to have a common denominator.  The least common multiple of 52 and 32 is 416.

*  We multiply 59/52 by 8/8 (which equals 1, so we don't change the value):
   (59/52) * (8/8) = 472/416

* We multiply 70/32 by 13/13:
   (70/32) * (13/13) = 910/416

Now we can add the fractions:

472/416 + 910/416 = 1382/416

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

1382/416 = (1382/2) / (416/2) = 691/208

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We already know the sum of 59/52 and 70/32 is 691/208.  Now we need to add 42/41.

To add fractions, they must have a common denominator. The least common multiple of 208 and 41 is 208.

Since 42/41 already has a denominator of 41, we can just multiply it by 5/5:

(42/41) * (5/5) = 210/208

Now we can add the two fractions:

691/208 + 210/208 = 901/208

This fraction cannot be simplified further, as the numerator and denominator have no common factors besides 1.

   * (74/52) * (8/8) = 592/416

3. **Add the fractions:**

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator.  We find the least common multiple (LCM) of 52 and 82:

* Prime factorize 52: 2 x 2 x 13
* Prime factorize 82: 2 x 41

The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all the prime factors: 2² x 13 x 41 = 2132

Now we adjust the fractions:

* (20/52) * (41/41) = 820/2132
* (75/82) * (26/26) = 1950/2132

Now we can add:

Finally, simplify by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:

First, find the LCM of 1066 and 75:

* Prime factorize 75: 3 x 5²

The LCM is 2 x 3 x 5² x 13 x 41 = 79350

Now adjust the fractions:

* (1385/1066) * (75/75) = 103875/79350
* (41/75) * (1066/1066) = 43726/79350

Finally, add the fractions:

*  92/84 is equivalent to (92 * 5) / (84 * 5) = 460/420

Now we can subtract the fractions:

2604/420 - 460/420 = (2604 - 460) / 420 = 2144/420

Now we can subtract:

2604/420 - 335/420 = (2604 - 335) / 420 = 2269/420

Finally, simplify by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3:

Now we need to find a common denominator for 3069/966 and 12/23. The least common multiple of 966 and 23 is 22218.

* 3069/966 * 23/23 = 70557/22218
* 12/23 * 966/966 = 11592/22218

Now we can add the fractions:

70557/22218 + 11592/22218 = 82149/22218

Finally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3:

82149/22218 = 27383/7406

Now we need to find a common denominator for 3 and 10/92.  The least common multiple of 1 and 92 is 92. 

*  3 = 3/1 * 92/92 = 276/92

Now we can subtract:

276/92 - 10/92 = 266/92

* 66 = 2 x 3 x 11
* 6 = 2 x 3
* 34 = 2 x 17

The LCM is 2 x 3 x 11 x 17 = 1122

Now, let's convert each fraction:

* 78/66 = (78 x 17) / (66 x 17) = 1326 / 1122

To subtract fractions, they need a common denominator.  The least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 16 is 112.

* LCM of 46 and 84: 2 x 2 x 3 x 7 x 23 = 1932

Now we'll adjust the fractions:

* 21/86 = (21 * 105) / (86 * 105) = 2205/9030

Now we can add the fractions:

85828/9030 + 2205/9030 = (85828 + 2205)/9030 = 88033/9030

Finally, we simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3:

88033/9030 = (88033/3) / (9030/3) = **29344/3010**

        Let's rethink a detail from your previous calculation. Instead of adding the fractions 12/70 and 84/9, suppose you need to consider a situation where you add 12/70 and 40/9 instead. What is the sum of these two fractions? Provide your answer as a simplified fraction.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Following the same steps as before, we need to find the LCM of 70 and 9, which is 630.  We then convert each fraction to have a denominator of 630:

* 12/70 = (12 * 9) / (70 * 9) = 108/630
* 40/9 = (40 * 70) / (9 * 70) = 2800/630

Now we can add the fractions:

108/630 + 2800/630 = (108 + 2800)/630 = 2908/630

Finally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 6:

2908/630 = (2908/6)/(630/6) = **484/105**

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Find a common denominator for 32/3 and 40/92:**
   - The least common multiple of 3 and 92 is 276.
   - Convert 32/3 to 276ths: (32/3) * (92/92) = 2944/276
   - Convert 40/92 to 276ths: (40/92) * (3/3) = 120/276

2. **Subtract the fractions:**
   - (2944/276) - (120/276) = 2824/276

3. **Double the result:**
   - (2824/276) * 2 = 5648/276

4. **Simplify (if possible):**
   - Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 4.
   - (5648/276) / (4/4) = 1412/69

5. **The final answer:**
   - We can simplify further by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3.
   - (1412/69) / (3/3) = **470.67** (rounded to two decimal places).

Adding these fractions:

79/12 + 79/12 = (79 + 79) / 12 = 158/12

* Factors of 22: 1, 2, 11, 22

The LCM of 76 and 22 is 836.

Now we'll convert each fraction:

* 91/76 * (11/11) = 1001/836
* 12/22 * (38/38) = 456/836

Finally, add the fractions:

1001/836 + 456/836 = 1457/836

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 11:

**1. Find a common denominator for 88/93 and 6/47:**

* The least common multiple (LCM) of 93 and 47 is 4371.
* Convert 88/93: (88 * 47) / (93 * 47) = 4136 / 4371
* Convert 6/47: (6 * 93) / (47 * 93) = 558 / 4371

**2. Add the fractions:**

    <pre class="model-raw-response">First, we need to find a common denominator for 52/21 and 75/67. The least common multiple of 21 and 67 is 1407.  

* 52/21 * (67/67) = 3484/1407
* 75/67 * (21/21) = 1575/1407

Now we can add the two fractions:

3484/1407 + 1575/1407 = 5059/1407

Next, we add 95/83 to this result.  We again need to find a common denominator, which is 116511.

* 5059/1407 * (83/83) = 420247/116511
* 95/83 * (1407/1407) = 133665/116511

Finally, we add the two fractions:

420247/116511 + 133665/116511 = 553912/116511

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 8.

553912/116511 = (553912/8) / (116511/8) = **69239/14564**

        Let's reconsider the problem where you were adding fractions. Previously, it was asked to add 34/1 to 53/4. Now consider whether it may have been 34/97 instead of 34/1. What will be the result if you add 34/97 to 53/4? Write your answer as a mixed number.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To add fractions, they must have the same denominator. The least common multiple of 97 and 4 is 388.

*  We multiply the numerator and denominator of 34/97 by 4 to get (34*4)/(97*4) = 136/388
* We multiply the numerator and denominator of 53/4 by 97 to get (53*97)/(4*97) = 5141/388

Now we can add the fractions:

136/388 + 5141/388 = (136 + 5141)/388 = 5277/388

To express this as a mixed number, we divide 5277 by 388:

5277 ÷ 388 = 13 with a remainder of 203

So, 5277/388 is equal to 13 203/388.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they must have a common denominator.  The least common multiple of 36 and 96 is 288.

* **Convert 3/36:**  Multiply numerator and denominator by 8: (3 * 8) / (36 * 8) = 24/288

* **Convert 97/96:** Multiply numerator and denominator by 3: (97 * 3) / (96 * 3) = 291/288

Now we can add: 24/288 + 291/288 = 315/288

Finally, simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3: 315/288 = (315/3) / (288/3) = 105/96

This fraction can be further simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3:  105/96 = (105/3) / (96/3) = **35/32**

Now, we can substitute the value of 'v' into the equation for 'd':

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 47 is 423.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Let's simplify the fraction 12/84 before we start. Both 12 and 84 are divisible by 12, so we can simplify the fraction to 1/7.

Now, we need to find a common denominator for 1/7 and 49/2. The least common multiple of 7 and 2 is 14.

* 1/7 = (1/7) * (2/2) = 2/14
* 49/2 = (49/2) * (7/7) = 343/14

Adding the fractions: 2/14 + 343/14 = (2 + 343)/14 = 345/14.

We can convert this improper fraction to a mixed number by dividing 345 by 14. 345/14 = 24 with a remainder of 9. 

Therefore, the sum of 12/84 and 49/2 is 24 9/14.

        What is the result of adding two fractions, where each fraction is 78/65?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to add two fractions that are both 78/65:

* **Understanding the Problem:** We're essentially multiplying the fraction 78/65 by 2.
* **Adding Fractions:** Since the fractions have the same denominator (65), we can simply add the numerators: 78 + 78 = 156
* **Simplifying:** The resulting fraction is 156/65. This can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (13): 156/13 = 12, and 65/13 = 5. 

Therefore, the result is 12/5.

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        After obtaining the result from the previous problem, where you added two fractions both equal to 78/65, what would you get if you add the result to 71/32?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We need to add the result from the previous problem (12/5) to 71/32.

**1. Finding a Common Denominator:**

* The least common multiple of 5 and 32 is 160.
*  To get a denominator of 160 for 12/5, multiply both numerator and denominator by 32: (12 * 32) / (5 * 32) = 384/160
* To get a denominator of 160 for 71/32, multiply both numerator and denominator by 5: (71 * 5) / (32 * 5) = 355/160

**2. Adding the Fractions:**

* Now that both fractions have the same denominator, we can add them: (384/160) + (355/160) = (384 + 355) / 160 = 739/160

**3. Simplifying (Optional):**

* The fraction 739/160 can be simplified to a mixed number: 4 99/160

Therefore, the result of adding the sum of the two 78/65 fractions (12/5) to 71/32 is 739/160 or 4 99/160.

        Suppose that instead of having two fractions both equal to 78/65 like in the previous problem, they were both equal to 78/78. What would be the result of adding these two fractions together?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this:

* **Understanding the Problem:**  78/78 is equivalent to 1 (any number divided by itself equals 1).  We are essentially adding 1 + 1.
* **Adding Whole Numbers:** 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, the result of adding two fractions, each equal to 78/78, is 2.

        Calculate the sum of 16/7 and 11/90. Answer as a simplified fraction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, they must have a common denominator.  The least common multiple of 7 and 90 is 630.

* Convert 16/7 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 630: (16/7) * (90/90) = 1440/630

* Convert 11/90 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 630: (11/90) * (7/7) = 77/630

Now we can add the fractions:

1440/630 + 77/630 = 1517/630

This fraction can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 7:

1517/630 = (1517/7) / (630/7) = 217/90
