        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: John spends a total of 13 hours on the puzzle. We know he spends 7 hours initially, so the additional time 'b' is the difference between the total time and the initial time.  Therefore:

b = 13 hours - 7 hours = 6 hours

            The sun is at an angle of 'j' degrees above the horizon. If we decrease this angle by 24 degrees, it becomes 52 degrees. What was the original angle of the sun above the horizon?

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how we can solve this problem:

* **Let 'j' represent the original angle.**
* **We know that decreasing the angle by 24 degrees results in 52 degrees.**  This can be written as an equation: j - 24 = 52
* **To solve for 'j', we need to isolate it. Add 24 to both sides of the equation:** j - 24 + 24 = 52 + 24
* **This simplifies to:** j = 76

Therefore, the original angle of the sun above the horizon was 76 degrees.

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Let's represent the original number of flowers as 'p'.  We know that after 21 flowers wilted, there were 11 left.  This can be written as an equation: p - 21 = 11. To find the original number of flowers (p), we need to isolate 'p' by adding 21 to both sides of the equation.

p - 21 + 21 = 11 + 21

This simplifies to: p = 32.

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's represent the initial number of hats with the variable &quot;z&quot;. We know that after selling 27 hats, there were 25 left. This can be written as an equation:

z - 27 = 25

To solve for &quot;z&quot;, we need to isolate it. We can do this by adding 27 to both sides of the equation:

z - 27 + 27 = 25 + 27

This simplifies to:

z = 52

Therefore, the store initially had 52 hats.
