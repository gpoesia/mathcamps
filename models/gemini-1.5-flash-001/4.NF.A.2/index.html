        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's compare the fractions 1/8 and 4/1. 

**Understanding the Comparison:**

* **Direct Comparison:**  It's difficult to directly compare these fractions because they have different denominators (the bottom number).
* **Finding a Common Denominator:** To compare them, we can find a common denominator.  The least common denominator for 8 and 1 is 8.

**Converting the Fractions:**

* **1/8** stays the same.
* **4/1** becomes **32/8** (multiply the numerator and denominator by 8).

**Comparison:**

Now we have 1/8 and 32/8.  Since 1 is smaller than 32, we can say:

**1/8 &lt; 32/8**

**Therefore, 1/8 is less than 4/1.**

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's analyze the fractions:

* **(3/7) _ (9/10)**

We can use the same strategy as before:

1. **Find a Common Denominator:**
    * The least common denominator of 7 and 10 is 70.
    * Convert 3/7: (3/7) * (10/10) = 30/70
    * Convert 9/10: (9/10) * (7/7) = 63/70

2. **Compare the Numerators:**
    * We have 30/70 and 63/70
    * Since 30 is less than 63, 30/70 is less than 63/70

3. **Conclusion:**
    * Therefore, (3/7) &lt; (9/10)

**Comparison:**

The comparison between (3/7) and (9/10) is **different** than the comparison between (3/2) and (9/10).  Decreasing the numerator of the first fraction from 3 to 3 makes the fraction smaller, resulting in a less than comparison instead of a greater than comparison.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's follow the same steps as before:

**1. Find a Common Denominator:**

* The least common denominator for 9 and 3 is 9.
* (10/9) remains the same.
* (5/3) * (3/3) = 15/9

**2. Compare the Numerators:**

* Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can compare the numerators: 10/9 &lt; 15/9

**3. The Answer:**

* Since 10 is less than 15, we know that 10/9 is less than 5/3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's analyze the fractions (2/7) and (2/4). 

* **Denominators:**  The denominator 4 is smaller than the denominator 7. This means the pieces represented by 2/4 are larger than the pieces represented by 2/7.

Therefore:

(2 / 7) **&lt;** (2 / 4)

**Yes, the outcome changes when we adjust the denominator in the second fraction from a 9 to a 4.** In the original comparison, (2/7) was greater than (2/9). However, when the denominator is reduced to 4, making the pieces larger, (2/7) becomes smaller than (2/4).

* **Simplify:** (6/1) simplifies to 6. We'll leave (4/3) as a fraction for now.

* **Common Denominator:** To compare, let's give (4/3) a denominator of 1 (the same as (6/1)).  We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 3: (4/3) * (3/3) = (12/3).

* **Compare:** Now we have 6 (from (6/1)) and 12/3.  Since 6 is less than 12/3, we know (6/1) is less than (4/3).

* **Conclusion:** (6/1) &lt; (4/3)

**Comparison to the previous result:**

In the previous comparison, (6/1) was greater than (4/4). In this comparison, (6/1) is less than (4/3). This highlights how changing the denominator of a fraction can significantly change its value relative to another fraction.

In the previous question, (3/9) was less than (8/8) because 8/8 represents the whole, while 3/9 represents a fraction of the whole. 

In this question, (3/9) is still less than (8/3), but now the second fraction (8/3) represents a quantity *greater* than the whole. This is because the denominator is smaller than the numerator. This change in denominator drastically alters the value of the second fraction and its comparison to the first.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's the question framed around the new expression:

**If you divide 6 by 4 and then divide 6 by 3, which result will be larger?**

Now, let's analyze the effect of the change in denominator:

* **Previous Question:**  (6 / 6) _ (6 / 3)  - This compared a whole (1) to a larger number (2).
* **Current Question:** (6 / 4) _ (6 / 3) - This compares a fraction (1.5) to a larger fraction (2). 

The change in denominator *does* affect the outcome. In the previous question, we had a whole number compared to a larger whole number.  In this question, we're comparing fractions, and while the denominator changes, the overall relationship remains the same. We're still dividing 6 by a smaller number in the second fraction (6/3), resulting in a larger value.

**Therefore, the outcome is the same: (6 / 4)  &lt;  (6 / 3)**

* **Find a common denominator:** The least common denominator for 10 and 4 is 20.

**What happens if we increase the numerator of the first fraction from 2 to 6?**

Increasing the numerator of the first fraction makes it **larger**.  Since the denominator remains the same, increasing the numerator means the fraction represents a bigger portion of the whole. 

This is why (6/10) is larger than (2/10), even though both fractions have the same denominator.

(1/9) **&lt;** (7/7) 

**Key point:**  Even though the numerator of the second fraction is larger, the denominator is also the same, making it a whole number. This makes it larger than any fraction with a numerator less than its denominator.

**Method 1: Finding a Common Denominator**

* Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 7 and 6. The LCM is 42.
* Convert both fractions to have a denominator of 42:
    * (2/7) * (6/6) = 12/42
    * (1/6) * (7/7) = 7/42
* Now, since 12/42 is greater than 7/42, we know: 2/7 &gt; 1/6

**Method 2: Cross-Multiplication**

* Multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction: 2 * 6 = 12
* Multiply the denominator of the first fraction by the numerator of the second fraction: 7 * 1 = 7
* Since 12 is greater than 7, we know: 2/7 &gt; 1/6

**Therefore, 2/7 is greater than 1/6 (2/7 &gt; 1/6).**

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Let's compare the fractions:

* **Simplify the second fraction:** 6/9 simplifies to 2/3.
* **Find a common denominator:** The smallest common denominator for 4 and 3 is 12.
* **Convert the fractions:**
    * (3/4) * (3/3) = 9/12

* **Compare:** 9/12 is greater than 8/12

**Therefore:** (3/4) &gt; (6/9)

**How the change affects the comparison:**

When the second fraction is 6/9 instead of 6/5, the comparison changes. 6/9 is smaller than 6/5 because dividing by a larger number results in a smaller quotient.  This means the second fraction is now smaller, and the first fraction (3/4) is now larger in comparison.

* **Original comparison:** (6/4) _ (2/2)  --&gt; We found that (6/4) &gt; (2/2)

* **New comparison:** (6/4) _ (2/10) 

* **Effect of the change:** Increasing the denominator of the second fraction from 2 to 10 makes the fraction smaller. This is because the denominator represents the number of parts the whole is divided into. A larger denominator means the whole is divided into more parts, making each part smaller.

* **Conclusion:**  Since (2/10) is much smaller than (2/2), it becomes even more obvious that (6/4) is greater than (2/10).

* The least common denominator for 7 and 4 is 28.
* Convert (4/7) to (16/28) by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 4.
* Convert (2/4) to (14/28) by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 7.

**Comparison Change:**

In the previous problem, (4/7) was *smaller* than (9/4). Now, (4/7) is *larger* than (2/4).

The change in comparison is due to the different second fraction.  (9/4) is a much larger fraction than (2/4), making the original comparison result in (4/7) being smaller.

* **Find a common denominator:** The least common denominator for 9 and 10 is 90.

**Therefore:**

**What happens when we change the denominator from 7 to 10?**

When we change the denominator of the second fraction from 7 to 10, the relationship between the two fractions changes.  

* **Original:** (5/9) &lt; (4/7)
* **New:** (5/9) &gt; (4/10)

The reason for this change is that increasing the denominator of the second fraction makes it smaller.  This is because the denominator represents the total number of parts in a whole.  A larger denominator means the whole is divided into more parts, making each individual part smaller.

            Given that you found the relation between the fractions (5 / 1) and (2 / 2) earlier, now consider if we replace the (2 / 2) with a new fraction. 

In the updated equation: (5 / 1) _ (7 / 2), replace the underscore with one of the following signs: &lt;, &gt;, or = to compare the two fractions. How does this change the result, if at all?

* 7/2 = 3.5

Now we can compare:

* 5 is greater than 3.5

Therefore:

(5 / 1) &gt; (7 / 2)

The result remains the same. Even though we changed the second fraction,  (5/1) is still greater than the new fraction (7/2).  The key difference is that the original fraction (2/2) was equal to 1, while the new fraction (7/2) is greater than 1, but still less than 5.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to approach this comparison:

* **Understanding the Fractions:** The first fraction (5/8) represents a value less than 1 (since the numerator is smaller than the denominator). The second fraction (6/5) represents a value greater than 1 (since the numerator is larger than the denominator). 

* **Direct Comparison:**  Since a fraction greater than 1 is always larger than a fraction less than 1, we can immediately conclude:

(5/8) &lt; (6/5)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare fractions, it's helpful to have a common denominator. 

* The least common denominator of 7 and 4 is 28. 
* (2/7) * (4/4) = 8/28
* (9/4) * (7/7) = 63/28

Since 8/28 is less than 63/28, we know that:

(2 / 7) **&lt;** (9 / 4)

* **Imagine a Pizza:** Think of a pizza cut into 5 slices (1/5). Now imagine another pizza cut into 10 slices (1/10).
* **Equal Amounts:** If you eat one slice of the 5-slice pizza (1/5), you've eaten more than if you ate one slice of the 10-slice pizza (1/10).  
* **Conclusion:**  One-fifth of something is always bigger than one-tenth of the same thing.

Therefore:

(1 / 5) &gt; (1 / 10)

* **Understanding Fractions:** A fraction represents a part of a whole. The larger the denominator, the smaller the pieces the whole is divided into.

* **Comparing with the Same Numerator:**  When fractions have the same numerator (top number), the fraction with the smaller denominator is larger.

* **Applying to Our Problem:**  10/8 has a larger denominator than 10/1. This means each piece represented by 10/8 is smaller than each piece represented by 10/1. Therefore, 10/8 is smaller than 10/1.

Here's the breakdown:

* **(10/10):**  This fraction represents the whole number 1, as 10 divided by 10 equals 1.

* **(4/9):** This fraction represents a part of a whole. Since the denominator is 9, the whole is divided into 9 equal parts. We have 4 out of these 9 parts.

**Key Point:** Even though the numerator of (4/9) is smaller than the numerator of (10/10),  the denominator is also smaller. This means the pieces in (4/9) are larger than the pieces in (10/10).

**Conclusion:** (10/10) represents a whole, while (4/9) represents a part of a whole. Therefore:

Compare the values of the following fractions by completing the sentence with one of the following options: &lt;, &gt;, or = :

Think of this like the previous situation, but instead of the second fraction having a numerator of 4 and a denominator of 8, it now has a numerator of 4 and denominator of 2. How does this change the comparison?

**Understanding Fractions**

* **Numerator:** The top number in a fraction (3 in both cases). It tells you how many parts you have.
* **Denominator:** The bottom number in a fraction (2 and 5). It tells you how many equal parts the whole is divided into.

**Comparing Fractions**

* **Same Numerator:** When the numerators are the same, the fraction with the smaller denominator represents a larger portion of the whole.  

**Applying the Logic**

* In this case, both fractions have a numerator of 3. 
* The fraction 3/2 has a smaller denominator (2) than 3/5 (denominator 5).
* Therefore, 3/2 represents a larger portion of the whole than 3/5.

            Considering the same comparison concept as the previous problem, but this time let's change the fractions. Still filling the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =, answer this question:

(9/6) _ (4/8)

Think about how this change, reducing the number in the numerator of the second fraction, affects the comparison between the two fractions.

* **Original Comparison:** (9/6) &gt; (6/8)  We know this is true from the previous problem.
* **New Comparison:** (9/6) _ (4/8)

**Reasoning:**

*  Reducing the numerator of the second fraction from 6 to 4 makes the fraction *smaller*. 
*  Since (4/8) is smaller than (6/8), and we know (9/6) is larger than (6/8), it follows that (9/6) is also larger than (4/8).

**Conclusion:**

* (9/6) &gt; (4/8)

(2 / 7) _ (8 / 7)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">You are right to point out that 8/7 represents more than a whole pizza.  While we can still compare fractions with different numerators and the same denominator, it's important to understand the context.

In this case, (2/7) represents two out of seven slices of a pizza. 
(8/7) represents eight out of seven slices of a pizza. This is more than a whole pizza! 

Since 2 is less than 8, even though both fractions have the same denominator,  (2/7) is smaller than (8/7).

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Now, consider if the fraction had been different. Compare the following fractions:

(1 / 10) _ (9 / 10)

How would your answer change from the previous question where you compared (6 / 10) and (9 / 10)?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's the comparison:

* **Understanding Fractions:**  As before, the larger the numerator, the larger the portion of the whole the fraction represents.
* **Common Denominators:**  Both fractions have the same denominator (10), making the comparison straightforward.

Since 1 is less than 9, we know that 1/10 is less than 9/10. 

**Answer: (1/10) &lt; (9/10)**

**How the answer changed:**

The answer remains the same:  **&lt;** (less than).  Even though the numerator in the first fraction changed from 6 to 1, the key is that both numerators are still smaller than the numerator in the second fraction (9). When the denominators are the same, the fraction with the larger numerator will always be greater.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to compare the fractions:

**1. Find a Common Denominator:**

* The least common denominator of 8 and 9 is 72.
* Convert (6/8) to (54/72) by multiplying numerator and denominator by 9.
* Convert (4/9) to (32/72) by multiplying numerator and denominator by 8.

**2. Compare the Numerators:**

* Now we have (54/72) and (32/72)
* Since 54 is greater than 32,  (54/72) is greater than (32/72).

**Conclusion:**

(6 / 8)  &gt; (4 / 9)
