        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Understand the formula:** The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

2. **Apply the given information:** We know the width (w) is 2m and the length (l) is 20m.

3. **Substitute the values:** Perimeter = 2 * (20m + 2m)

4. **Calculate:** Perimeter = 2 * (22m) = 44m

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two equal lengths and two equal widths, we can use the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width). 

Let's plug in the values: Perimeter = 2 * (38m + 29m) = 2 * 67m = 134m.
