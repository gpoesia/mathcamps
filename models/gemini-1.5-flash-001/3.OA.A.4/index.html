* **Find the jumps per minute:** The dolphin jumps 5 times per minute.
* **Set up an equation:** Let 'p' represent the number of minutes the dolphin jumped. We know the dolphin jumps 5 times per minute and made 60 jumps total, so we can write the equation: 5 * p = 60
* **Solve for 'p':**  Divide both sides of the equation by 5: p = 60 / 5
* **Calculate:** p = 12

        A plane crashed into a deserted island and split into multiple parts. After an investigation, it was found that there were 48 parts in total. If each plane section accounts for 8 parts, how many sections did the plane originally have before the crash?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of sections, we divide the total number of parts by the number of parts per section.
This is 48 parts / 8 parts/section = &lt;&lt;48/8=6&gt;&gt;6 sections.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many friends the farmer has, we need to divide the total number of strawberries by the number of strawberries each friend receives. 
 
The farmer has 40 strawberries / 4 strawberries per friend = 10 friends.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many regions there would be, we simply divide the total number of lions by the number of lions per region.

        For an upcoming clothing sale, a store decides to discount their jackets. After the discount, each jacket costs 6 dollars. If the original price was &quot;d&quot; dollars and it's now 1/5th of its original price, what was the original price of the jacket?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know that the discounted price (6 dollars) is 1/5th of the original price (d dollars).  This can be written as an equation: 
(1/5) * d = 6 
To find the original price (d), we need to isolate it. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:
d = 6 * 5
d = 30

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

        An astronaut has 88 hours of oxygen in his tank. If he can use this tank for 8 days, how many hours of oxygen does the tank provide each day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many hours of oxygen the tank provides each day, we divide the total hours of oxygen by the number of days the tank can last. 
This means 88 hours / 8 days = &lt;&lt;88/8=11&gt;&gt;11 hours per day.
