            The sun radiates 752 quintillion joules of energy every second. During night time on the earth, approximately 243 quintillion joules of this energy isn't received. How much energy from the sun is received on earth during nighttime every second?

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The amount of energy received during nighttime can be calculated by subtracting the energy not received from the total energy radiated. 

This means: 752 quintillion joules - 243 quintillion joules = 509 quintillion joules

Therefore, 509 quintillion joules of energy from the sun is received on Earth during nighttime every second.

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how much energy the Earth is lacking, we need to subtract the energy received during nighttime from the minimum energy required. 

This means: 730 quintillion joules - 509 quintillion joules = 221 quintillion joules. 

Therefore, the Earth is lacking 221 quintillion joules of energy every second during nighttime.

            Continuing from our previous problem, the ballerina, later in the evening, decided to add to her routine and performed some more pirouettes. However, she was a bit tired and was unable to count exactly how many she did. She only knew that after those additional pirouettes, the total number of pirouettes she did for the day was 314 less than if she had doubled the number of pirouettes she performed before dinner. How many pirouettes did she do after dinner?

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Doubling the number of pirouettes the ballerina performed before dinner would be 2 * 575 = 1150 pirouettes.
She did 314 less than that, meaning she did 1150 - 314 = 836 pirouettes in total for the day.
Therefore, after dinner she performed 836 - 575 = 261 pirouettes.

            In retrospect, the astronomers realized they had made a slight mistake. Instead of 67 planets with stars, they realized there were actually 192 stars with planets. So, including the 244 stars without planets in the remote galaxy, how many stars are there now in that galaxy?

            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Now that we know there are 192 stars with planets, we add that to the 244 stars without planets to find the total number of stars.

Total stars = Stars with planets + Stars without planets 
Total stars = 192 + 244
