        A window cleaning company charges $533.89 for cleaning the windows of a large building, and this cost is equally shared by 20.3 tenants. How much does each tenant contribute to the window cleaning cost?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how much each tenant contributes, we need to divide the total cost by the number of tenants: $533.89 / 20.3 tenants = $26.33 per tenant (rounded to the nearest cent).

        Previously, the window cleaning cost was divided among the tenants based on a total expense of $533.89. However, it turns out there was a mistake in the billing and the cleaning company only charged $21 for the job. With this adjusted cost, how much would each of the 20.3 tenants need to contribute to the window cleaning cost now?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many kilograms of cucumber each store received, we need to divide the total amount of cucumber by the number of stores. 
So, each store received 2218.5 kilograms / 51 stores = &lt;&lt;2218.5/51=43.5&gt;&gt; 43.5 kilograms of cucumber.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Each store received 43.5 kilograms of cucumber and used 25.3 kilograms for the salad.  To find out how much cucumber was left, we subtract the amount used from the amount received. 

So, each store has 43.5 kilograms - 25.3 kilograms = &lt;&lt;43.5-25.3=18.2&gt;&gt; 18.2 kilograms of cucumber left.

        A snow machine produces 60.87 pounds of artificial snow per hour. If the machine runs for 27.5 hours, it then produces a certain amount of artificial snow. However, and due to an error, 67.2 pounds of the produced snow were lost or unusable. How many pounds of usable artificial snow were left after the loss?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to calculate the total amount of snow produced:

Total snow produced = Snow production rate per hour * Number of hours
Total snow produced = 60.87 pounds/hour * 27.5 hours
Total snow produced = 1673.925 pounds

Then, subtract the unusable snow to find the amount of usable snow left:

Usable snow = Total snow produced - Unusable snow
Usable snow = 1673.925 pounds - 67.2 pounds
Usable snow = 1606.725 pounds

        Following the previous scenario with the same snow machine, let's consider an updated rate. Now, the machine produces 60.87 pounds of artificial snow per hour, but in this new situation, it runs for a more extensive period, specifically 58 hours. How many pounds of artificial snow will be produced under this new condition?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Similar to the previous calculation, we multiply the snow production rate per hour by the new number of hours the machine runs.

Total snow produced = Snow production rate per hour * Number of hours

Total snow produced = 60.87 pounds/hour * 58 hours

Total snow produced = 3530.26 pounds

        A dolphin can travel 1687.56 miles within a certain period. If it travels the same distance in 29.4 days, how many miles does the dolphin travel each day?

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the distance the dolphin travels each day, we need to divide the total distance by the number of days.

Therefore, the dolphin travels 1687.56 miles / 29.4 days = &lt;&lt;1687.56 / 29.4 = 57.4&gt;&gt; 57.4 miles each day.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We know the dolphin travels 57.4 miles per day on its own.  With the current helping, it travels an additional 57.93 miles per day.  To find the total distance traveled, we add these two distances.

Therefore, the dolphin travels a total of 57.4 miles + 57.93 miles = &lt;&lt;57.4 + 57.93 = 115.33&gt;&gt; 115.33 miles each day with the current helping.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the distance the dolphin travels each day over 91 days, we'll divide the total distance by the new number of days.

Therefore, the dolphin would travel 1687.56 miles / 91 days = &lt;&lt;1687.56 / 91 = 18.5&gt;&gt; 18.5 miles each day.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

This gives us a total of 47.33 * 73.34 = 3468.84 chickens. 
However, since we cannot have fractions of chickens, we need to round this number to the nearest whole number.
Since 0.84 is greater than 0.5, we round up to 3469.

    </p>
    <p>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">We need to figure out the difference in speed and then multiply that by the power increase per mile per hour. 

Flash needs to increase his speed by 30.54 miles per hour.

Since his power increases by 73.5 units for every 1 mile per hour increase in speed, his total power increase will be: 30.54 miles per hour * 73.5 units/mile per hour = 2247.49 units.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total weight, we need to multiply the weight of each fish by the number of fish caught. 

Total weight = weight per fish * number of fish

Total weight = 86.7 kg/fish * 30.4 fish

Total weight = 2631.28 kg

        A factory produced 24.91 pencils per minute for a consecutive period of 46.98 minutes. How many pencils were produced in total?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total number of pencils produced, we need to multiply the number of pencils produced per minute by the total time in minutes. 

So, the total number of pencils produced is 24.91 pencils/minute * 46.98 minutes = 1170.2538 pencils.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a pencil, we round the answer down to the nearest whole number.

        Following up on the previous question, the standard weight for this type of tent is set at 85.4 pounds. After working out the actual weight of each tent, how much do the tents differ from the standard weight?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">We know that the actual weight of each tent is 20.91 pounds.  The standard weight is 85.4 pounds. To find the difference, we subtract the actual weight from the standard weight:

85.4 pounds - 20.91 pounds = 64.49 pounds

        Following up on the previous question, what if there were actually 45 tents in the fleet instead of 69.3? With the same total weight of 1448.37 pounds, how much would each tent weigh then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">If there are 45 tents in the fleet with a total weight of 1448.37 pounds, we can find the weight of each tent by dividing the total weight by the number of tents.

This gives us: 1448.37 pounds / 45 tents = 32.19 pounds/tent (approximately)

        Each bubble has a volume of 55.9 cubic centimeters. If a child blows 77.8 such bubbles, what would be the total volume of the bubbles in cubic centimeters?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total volume, we need to multiply the volume of one bubble by the number of bubbles blown. 

Total volume = volume of one bubble * number of bubbles
Total volume = 55.9 cubic centimeters * 77.8 
Total volume = 4354.82 cubic centimeters

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the total amount of vegetation the dinosaur consumes, we multiply the amount it eats per hour by the number of hours it eats. 
This means we need to calculate 19.45 kilograms/hour * 48.71 hours. 
19.45 * 48.71 = 949.2245 kilograms.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  We know the dragon currently has 65.4 kg of gold + 28.5 kg of gems = 93.9 kg of hoard.  He wants to decrease the hoard by 6.74 kg.
