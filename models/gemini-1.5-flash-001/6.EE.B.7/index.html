            In a bag, there are total 355 balls. If there are already 44 green balls, how many red balls should be added to the bag?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemini-1.5 Flash:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many red balls should be added, we first need to know how many non-green balls are already in the bag. 

We subtract the number of green balls from the total number of balls: 355 - 44 = 311

So, 311 balls are not green.  Since we don't know how many of those are red, we can't determine exactly how many red balls need to be added.  We only know that the total number of red balls needs to be 311 to fill the bag.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Since there are two half minutes in a minute, and the machine blows 440 bubbles in a minute, it blows 440/2 = &lt;&lt;440/2=220&gt;&gt;220 bubbles in half a minute.  We know the machine blows 325 bubbles in the first half minute. Therefore, it must blow 220-325 = &lt;&lt;220-325=-105&gt;&gt; -105 bubbles in the second half minute. However, this is impossible, as a machine cannot blow a negative number of bubbles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of plants, we need to divide the total number of cucumbers by the number of cucumbers per plant. 

This can be represented as: Number of plants = Total cucumbers / Cucumbers per plant.

Therefore, the number of plants is 242 / 22 = &lt;&lt;242/22=11&gt;&gt;11 plants.
