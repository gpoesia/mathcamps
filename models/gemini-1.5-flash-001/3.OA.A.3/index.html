            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To figure out how many toy cars go in each box, we need to divide the total number of cars (63) by the number of boxes (5).

63 divided by 5 equals 12 with a remainder of 3. 

This means that 12 toy cars will go into each of the 5 boxes, and we'll have 3 toy cars left over.

            A librarian decided to arrange books on a shelf. She placed 8 books in a row and made sure every row had the same number of books. How many books were there if the arrangement was square (i.e., the same number of rows as there were books in a row)?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: Since the arrangement is square, the number of rows is the same as the number of books in a row.  Therefore, there are 8 rows.

The total number of books is the number of rows multiplied by the number of books in a row, so there are 8 x 8 = &lt;&lt;8*8=64&gt;&gt;64 books.

            Following the previous problem about the librarian, let's consider a different scenario. This time, she decides to arrange a smaller square of books with only 4 books in a row. Each row still has the same number of books. So, how many books does she need for this smaller square arrangement?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  Since the arrangement is a square, and there are 4 books in a row, there are also 4 rows. 

To find the total number of books, we multiply the number of rows by the number of books in a row: 4 rows * 4 books/row = 16 books.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know that each gallon fills 2 containers. To find out how many gallons we need for 11 containers, we divide the total number of containers by the number of containers each gallon fills: 11 containers / 2 containers/gallon = 5.5 gallons. 

Since we can't have half a gallon, we'll need to round up to the nearest whole number.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many pieces of gold are in each pile when divided into 11 piles, we need to divide the total gold (80 pieces) by the number of piles (11).  
80 pieces of gold / 11 piles = 7.27 pieces of gold per pile.

Since we can't have fractions of gold pieces, we need to think about how to distribute the gold.  We can put 7 pieces of gold in each pile, and we'll have some leftover.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            After reflecting on her toy buying habits, Mommy realizes that she bought too many toys in the beginning. Instead of buying 5 new toys every month for 10 months, she now remembers that there was a month when she didn't buy any toys. Therefore, she only bought 5 toys per month for 9 months. How many toys did she actually buy during that period?
