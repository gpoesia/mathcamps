            Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

1. (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
2. (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how we can solve for the values of q and s using the system of equations:

**1. Elimination Method**

* **Multiply the second equation by 7.6667 (approximately):** This will allow us to eliminate 'q' when we add the equations together.

   (30 * s) + (12 * q) = 121  
   * 7.6667 = (229.9991 * s) + (91.9996 * q) = 925.0007

* **Add the modified second equation to the first equation:** 

   (40 * s) - (91 * q) = 37
   (229.9991 * s) + (91.9996 * q) = 925.0007
   ---------------------------------------
   (269.9991 * s) = 962.0007

* **Solve for 's':**

   s = 962.0007 / 269.9991
   s â‰ˆ 3.56

**2. Substitute 's' back into either equation to solve for 'q':**

Let's use the first equation:

(40 * 3.56) - (91 * q) = 37
142.4 - (91 * q) = 37
- (91 * q) = 37 - 142.4
- (91 * q) = -105.4
q = -105.4 / -91
q â‰ˆ 1.15

**Therefore:**

* **s â‰ˆ 3.56**
* **q â‰ˆ 1.15**

### Answer: s â‰ˆ 3.56, q â‰ˆ 1.15

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We can solve this system of equations using elimination.

1. **Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2:** 
   This will make the coefficients of 'b' in both equations multiples of 6, allowing us to eliminate 'b'.

   *  12b + 132m = 540 
   *  158m - 12b = 96

2. **Add the two equations together:** 
   This eliminates 'b' and gives us an equation solely in terms of 'm'.

   * 290m = 636

3. **Solve for 'm':** 
   Divide both sides of the equation by 290 to isolate 'm'.

   * m = 636/290 
   * m = 2.193 (approximately)

4. **Substitute the value of 'm' back into either original equation to solve for 'b':** 
   Let's use the first equation: 4b + 44m = 180

   * 4b + 44(2.193) = 180
   * 4b + 96.52 = 180

1. **Multiply the second equation by -37.5** This will allow us to eliminate 'f' when we add the equations together.
   -37.5 * (2 * f + 90 * g) = -37.5 * 143

2. **Add the first equation to the modified second equation:**

**1.  Solve for one variable in terms of the other in one equation.**

Let's solve the first equation for *g*:

* 146 = 28 * g + 26 * l
* 146 - 26 * l = 28 * g
* g = (146 - 26 * l) / 28

**2. Substitute this expression into the second equation.**

* 6 = 41 * l - 53 * [(146 - 26 * l) / 28] 

**3. Simplify and solve for *l*.**

* 6 = 41 * l - 53 * (146/28) + 53 * (26/28) * l
* 6 = 41 * l - 270.25 + 49.75 * l
* 276.25 = 90.75 * l
* l = 276.25 / 90.75
* l = 3

**4. Substitute the value of *l* back into either of the original equations to solve for *g*.**

Let's use the first equation:

* 146 = 28 * g + 26 * 3
* 146 = 28 * g + 78
* 68 = 28 * g

   - Multiply equation (2) by -56: -4984p - 392y = -5488

2. **Add the modified equations:** Notice that the 'y' terms will cancel out:

   - Multiply the second equation by 22: 132d + 1518k = 2112

* **Add the modified equations:**

* **Solve for k:**
   - Divide both sides by 1950:

      k = 1.135 (rounded to three decimal places)

* **Substitute the value of k back into either original equation to solve for d:**
   - Let's use the first equation:
      72 * 1.135 - 22d = 17
      81.72 - 22d = 17
      -22d = -64.72

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We can solve this system of equations using elimination. Here's how:

**1. Multiply the second equation by 3.3:** This will allow us to have the same coefficient for 'd' in both equations, but with opposite signs.

   3.3 * (10d + 14h) = 3.3 * 91
   33d + 46.2h = 300.3

**2. Add the modified second equation to the first equation:** This will eliminate 'd'.

   73h - 33d = 48

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this system of equations:

**1.  Solve for one variable in terms of the other**

Let's solve the second equation for 'r':

* 109 = (37 * a) + (6 * r)
* 109 - (37 * a) = 6 * r
* r = (109 - (37 * a)) / 6

**2. Substitute into the first equation**

Now, substitute this expression for 'r' into the first equation:

* 53 = ((89 * ((109 - (37 * a)) / 6)) - (74 * a))

**3. Simplify and solve for 'a'**

* 53 = (89 * (109 - 37a) / 6) - 74a
* 53 * 6 = 89 * (109 - 37a) - 74a * 6
* 318 = 9721 - 3293a - 444a
* 318 - 9721 = -3737a
* -9403 = -3737a
* a = -9403 / -3737 
* a = 2.52 (approximately)

**4. Substitute 'a' to find 'r'**

Now that we know 'a', we can plug it back into either of the original equations to solve for 'r'. Let's use the second equation:

* 109 = (37 * 2.52) + (6 * r)
* 109 = 93.24 + 6r
* 109 - 93.24 = 6r
* 15.76 = 6r

**Step 1: Define Equations**

We can represent the given information as a system of equations:

* Equation 1: 42g + 12q = 169
* Equation 2: 12q - 50g = 19

**Step 2: Solve for one variable**

We can use the elimination method to solve for one variable. Let's eliminate 'q':

* Multiply Equation 1 by -1: -42g - 12q = -169
* Add the modified Equation 1 to Equation 2: -92g = -150
* Solve for 'g': g = -150 / -92 = 1.63 (rounded to two decimal places)

**Step 3: Solve for the other variable**

Now that we know 'g', substitute it back into either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to solve for 'q'. Let's use Equation 1:

* 42(1.63) + 12q = 169
* 68.46 + 12q = 169
* 12q = 100.54

**3. Substitute:**

Substitute this expression for 'v' into the second equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the system of equations for *g* and *z*:

**1. Elimination Method**

* **Multiply the second equation by 14.5:** This will make the coefficients of *z* opposites. 
   (72 * g - 3 * z = 68) * 14.5  =  1044 * g - 43.5 * z = 986

* **Add the modified second equation to the first equation:** This eliminates *z*.
   (43 * z - 91 * g = 33) 
   + (1044 * g - 43.5 * z = 986)
   -----------------------
   953 * g = 1019

* **Solve for *g*:**
   g = 1019 / 953
   g = 1.07

* **Substitute the value of *g* back into either original equation to solve for *z*. Let's use the first equation:**
   43 * z - 91 * (1.07) = 33
   43 * z - 97.57 = 33
   43 * z = 130.57
   z = 130.57 / 43
   z = 3.04

**Therefore:**

* g = 1.07
* z = 3.04

            Alex's and Brad's baskets contained c cherries and f figs respectively. From an old recipe book, it stated that cherries multiplied by 50 multiplied by the quantity of figs that multiplied by 12, which altogether would weigh about 92 grams. Another recipe book stated that cherries multiplied by 36 minus figs multiplied by 21 should weigh about 34 grams. Can you find the quantity of cherries (c) and figs (f)? Use the following system of equations to solve:

50c + 12f = 92
36c - 21f = 34.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We can solve this system of equations using elimination.  To eliminate 'f', we'll multiply the first equation by 21 and the second equation by 12. This gives us:

* 1050c + 252f = 1932
* 432c - 252f = 408

Now, we can add the two equations together, eliminating 'f':

1482c = 2340

Solving for 'c':

c = 2340 / 1482 = 1.57 (approximately)

Now, we can substitute this value of 'c' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'f'.  Let's use the first equation:

50(1.57) + 12f = 92

78.5 + 12f = 92

12f = 13.5

f = 13.5 / 12 = 1.125 (approximately)

Therefore, Alex's basket contained approximately 1.57 cherries, and Brad's basket contained approximately 1.125 figs. 

It's worth noting that the answers are not whole numbers, which might indicate a slight error in the recipe books or the given weights.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how we can solve for 'a' and 'i':

**1. Set up the equations:**

* Equation 1: 75a - 4i = 42
* Equation 2: 10i + 13a = 160

**2. Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**

Let's solve Equation 1 for 'i':

* 75a - 4i = 42
* -4i = 42 - 75a
* i = (75a - 42) / 4

**3. Substitute the expression for 'i' into Equation 2:**

* 10i + 13a = 160
* 10 * ((75a - 42) / 4) + 13a = 160

**4. Simplify and solve for 'a':**

* (750a - 420) / 4 + 13a = 160
* 750a - 420 + 52a = 640
* 802a = 1060
* a = 1060 / 802
* a = 1.32 

**5. Substitute the value of 'a' back into the expression for 'i':**

* i = (75a - 42) / 4
* i = (75 * 1.32 - 42) / 4
* i = (99 - 42) / 4
* i = 57 / 4

* c = (18 * p + 13) / 27

**2. Substitute the expression into the first equation:**

Substitute the expression for *c* into the first equation:

            Consider the following system of equations, calculate the values of y and z: 24 * z + 72 * y = 139,
2 * z + 82 * y = 96.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve for y and z:

**1. Elimination Method**

* **Multiply the second equation by -12:** This will allow us to eliminate 'z' when we add the equations together. 
   -12 * (2z + 82y) = -12 * 96
   -24z - 984y = -1152

* **Add the modified second equation to the first equation:**
    (24z + 72y = 139) + (-24z - 984y = -1152)
    -912y = -1013

* **Solve for y:**
    y = -1013 / -912
    y = 1.11 

* **Substitute the value of y back into either original equation to solve for z.** Let's use the first equation:
    24z + 72(1.11) = 139
    24z + 79.92 = 139
    24z = 59.08
    z = 59.08 / 24
    z = 2.46

**1. Elimination Method:**

* **Notice:** The 'h' terms have the same coefficient (23) but opposite signs in the two equations. This makes elimination a good strategy.

* **Add the equations together:**
   (23h - 46p) + (11p + 23h) = 58 + 124
   46h - 35p = 182

* **Simplify:**
   2h - (5/2)p = 13 

* **Multiply the simplified equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:**
   4h - 5p = 26 

* **Now we have a new system:**
    * 4h - 5p = 26
    * 11p + 23h = 124 

* **Multiply the first equation by 11 and the second equation by 5 to make the 'p' coefficients match:**
    * 44h - 55p = 286
    * 55p + 115h = 620

* **Add the equations together:**

* **Solve for 'h':**
    * h = 906 / 159
    * h = 5.7

* **Substitute the value of 'h' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'p'. Let's use the first equation:**

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how we can solve this system of linear equations:

**Method: Elimination**

1. **Multiply Equations to Match Coefficients:**  We want to make the coefficients of either 'm' or 'r' the same (but with opposite signs) in both equations.  Let's focus on 'r'.  
   * Multiply equation (1) by 52: 
      2184m + 2860r = 6604
   * Multiply equation (2) by 55:
      3630m - 2860r = 2420

2. **Add the Modified Equations:** Notice that the 'r' terms have opposite signs.  Adding the equations will eliminate 'r':
   (2184m + 2860r) + (3630m - 2860r) = 6604 + 2420
   5814m = 9024

3. **Solve for 'm':**
   m = 9024 / 5814 
   m = 1.55 

4. **Substitute 'm' Back into One of the Original Equations:** Let's use equation (1):
   42 * 1.55 + 55 * r = 127
   65.1 + 55 * r = 127

5. **Solve for 'r':**
   55 * r = 127 - 65.1
   55 * r = 61.9
   r = 61.9 / 55
   r = 1.13

**Solution:**

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:

1. **Multiply the first equation by 88 and the second equation by 7:**
   This will allow us to have opposite coefficients for 'p' in both equations.
   
   * (53 * e + 7 * p) * 88 = 103 * 88

2. **Add the two equations together:**

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this system of linear equations:

**1.  Elimination Method**

   * **Multiply equations to match coefficients:**
      * Multiply the first equation by 8:  (144p - 56s) = 168
      * Multiply the second equation by 7: (357s - 168p) = 98

   * **Add the modified equations:** Notice that the 'p' coefficients have opposite signs. 
      (144p - 56s) + (357s - 168p) = 168 + 98
      This simplifies to: 301s = 266

   * **Solve for 's':** 
      s = 266 / 301

   * **Substitute 's' back into either original equation to solve for 'p':** 
      Let's use the first equation:
      (18p - 7 * (266/301)) = 21
      18p - (1862/301) = 21
      18p = 21 + (1862/301)
      18p = (6323/301)
      p = (6323/301) / 18
      p = 6323/5418

**Therefore:**

* p = 6323/5418
* s = 266/301

### Answer: p = 6323/5418, s = 266/301

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the system of equations:

**1. Write the equations in standard form:**

* Equation 1: 59c - 34w = 84
* Equation 2: 11c + 42w = 98

**2. Use elimination to solve for one variable:**

* **Multiply Equation 2 by 34:**  This will allow us to eliminate 'w' when we add the equations together.
   * (11c + 42w) * 34 = 98 * 34
   * 374c + 1428w = 3332
* **Add the modified Equation 2 to Equation 1:**
   * (59c - 34w) + (374c + 1428w) = 84 + 3332
   * 433c + 1394w = 3416
   * 433c = 3416  (Since the 'w' terms cancel out)

**3. Solve for 'c':**

* Divide both sides by 433: 
   * c = 3416 / 433 
   * c = 7.88 (approximately)

**4. Substitute the value of 'c' back into either original equation to solve for 'w':**

* Let's use Equation 1:
   * 59 * 7.88 - 34w = 84
   * 465.52 - 34w = 84
   * -34w = 84 - 465.52
   * -34w = -381.52
   * w = -381.52 / -34
   * w = 11.22 (approximately)

**Therefore:**

* c = 7.88
* w = 11.22

**1. Elimination Method**

* **Multiply the first equation by 2:** This will make the coefficients of 'f' opposites in both equations.

   90 * f + 84 * z = 202

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use elimination.  We can multiply the second equation by 48/41, then add the two equations together. This will eliminate 'f' and allow us to solve for 'k'.

Here's how it works:

1. **Multiply the second equation by 48/41:** 
   (33 * k - 41 * f) * (48/41) = 31 * (48/41)
   This simplifies to:  38.4 * k - 48 * f = 36.24

2. **Add the two equations together:**
   (10 * k + 48 * f) + (38.4 * k - 48 * f) = 161 + 36.24
   This simplifies to: 48.4 * k = 197.24

3. **Solve for k:**
   k = 197.24 / 48.4
   k = 4.08

4. **Substitute the value of k back into either of the original equations to solve for f.  Let's use the first equation:**
   10 * 4.08 + 48 * f = 161
   40.8 + 48 * f = 161
   48 * f = 120.2
   f = 120.2 / 48
   f = 2.5

Therefore, the values of k and f that satisfy the system of equations are:

1. **Multiply the first equation by 25 and the second equation by 29:** This will allow us to have the same coefficient for 'y' in both equations.
   *  (29y - 28j) * 25 = 725y - 700j = 975
   *  (25y + 37j) * 29 = 725y + 1073j = 3364

2. **Subtract the first modified equation from the second modified equation:** This eliminates 'y' and allows us to solve for 'j'.
   *  (725y + 1073j) - (725y - 700j) = 3364 - 975

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the system of equations:

**1. Elimination Method**

* **Multiply equations to match coefficients:**  Our goal is to make the coefficients of either 't' or 'g' the same (but opposite signs) in both equations. Let's eliminate 'g':
    * Multiply the first equation by 91:  (39 * 91)t + (41 * 91)g = 147 * 91
    * Multiply the second equation by 41:  (94 * 41)t - (91 * 41)g = 42 * 41 
* **Add the equations:** Notice that the 'g' terms will cancel out:
    (39 * 91)t + (41 * 91)g = 147 * 91
    (94 * 41)t - (91 * 41)g = 42 * 41
    -----------------------------
    (39 * 91 + 94 * 41)t = (147 * 91 + 42 * 41) 
* **Solve for 't':**
    3549t + 3834t = 13383 + 1722
    7383t = 15105
    t = 15105 / 7383
    t = 2.045 (approximately)

**2. Substitute to find 'g':**

* Choose either of the original equations and substitute the value of 't' we just found. Let's use the first equation:
    39 * 2.045 + 41 * g = 147
    79.755 + 41 * g = 147
* **Solve for 'g':**
    41 * g = 147 - 79.755
    41 * g = 67.245
    g = 67.245 / 41
    g = 1.64 (approximately)

**Therefore:**
* t â‰ˆ 2.045
* g â‰ˆ 1.64

1. **Multiply the first equation by 48 and the second equation by 55:**
   This will allow us to eliminate 'o' when we add the equations together.
   - (6c + 55o) * 48 = 288c + 2640o = 5376
   - (55c - 48o) * 55 = 3025c - 2640o = 1980

2. **Add the two equations together:**
   Notice that the 'o' terms cancel out.

2. **Subtract the second equation from the first equation.** This eliminates 'w'.

            Given the equations below, find the values of r and d:

For the first equation, consider 67 apples, each worth d dollars, and 37 ragdolls, each worth r dollars. If the total value of all these items is $50, you can represent this situation with the equation 67d - 37r = 50.

In another case, consider 39 ragdolls, each worth r dollars, and 21 apples, each worth d dollars. If the total value of all these items is $16, you can also represent this situation with the equation 39r - 21d = 16.

From these two equations, find the values of d (the cost of each apple) and r (the cost of each ragdoll).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We have two equations:

1.  67d - 37r = 50
2.  39r - 21d = 16

To solve for 'd' and 'r', we can use a method called elimination. Here's how:

**1. Multiply the equations to make the coefficients of 'd' (or 'r') the same:**

* Multiply equation 1 by 21: 1407d - 777r = 1050
* Multiply equation 2 by 67: 2613r - 1407d = 1072

**2. Add the modified equations together:**

* Notice that the 'd' terms cancel out:  (1407d - 777r) + (2613r - 1407d) = 1050 + 1072
* This simplifies to: 1836r = 2122

**3. Solve for 'r':**

* Divide both sides by 1836: r = 2122/1836
* Therefore, r â‰ˆ 1.15

**4. Substitute the value of 'r' back into either original equation to solve for 'd':**

* Let's use equation 1: 67d - 37(1.15) = 50
* Simplify: 67d - 42.55 = 50
* Add 42.55 to both sides: 67d = 92.55
* Divide both sides by 67: d â‰ˆ 1.38

**Therefore:**

* The cost of each apple (d) is approximately $1.38.
* The cost of each ragdoll (r) is approximately $1.15.

**2. Substitute the expression for the variable into the second equation.**

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We can solve this system of equations using elimination. To do that, we need to make the coefficients of either 'p' or 'b' the same in both equations.  Let's multiply the first equation by 22 and the second equation by 9. This will give us the same coefficient for 'p' in both equations:

* Equation 1 * 22:  1474 * p + 396 * b = 2420
* Equation 2 * 9:   738 * b - 396 * p = 522

Now, we can add the two equations together:

* (1474 * p + 396 * b) + (738 * b - 396 * p) = 2420 + 522
* 1474 * p + 396 * b + 738 * b - 396 * p = 2942
* 1078 * p + 1134 * b = 2942

Now we have a new equation with only 'p' and 'b'. Let's rearrange the first original equation to solve for 'p':

* 67 * p + 18 * b = 110
* 67 * p = 110 - 18 * b
* p = (110 - 18 * b) / 67

Now we can substitute this value of 'p' into the new equation we derived:

* 1078 * ((110 - 18 * b) / 67) + 1134 * b = 2942
* 1798 * (110 - 18 * b) + 76122 * b = 197214
* 197780 - 32364 * b + 76122 * b = 197214
* 43758 * b = -556 
* b = -556 / 43758

Now we can substitute this value of 'b' back into the equation for 'p':

* p = (110 - 18 * (-556 / 43758)) / 67
* p = (110 + 9996/43758) / 67
* p = (4814440/43758) / 67
* p = 4814440 / 2931826

**1. Set up the equations:**

*  63c - 36e = 27 
*  8c + 32e = 69

**2. Simplify the equations (optional):**

We can simplify the equations by dividing both sides of the first equation by 9 and the second equation by 8:

* 7c - 4e = 3
* c + 4e = 69/8

**3. Solve for one variable:**

We can use elimination to solve for 'c'.  Notice that the 'e' terms have opposite signs in the two equations.  Add the two equations together:

   7c - 4e = 3

------------------
   8c        = 87/8

Now, solve for 'c':

   c = (87/8) / 8 
   c = 87/64

**4. Substitute to find the other variable:**

Substitute the value of 'c' (87/64) into either of the original equations. Let's use the second equation:

8(87/64) + 32e = 69

Simplify and solve for 'e':

87/8 + 32e = 69
32e = 69 - 87/8
32e = 465/8
e = (465/8) / 32
e = 465/256

    3095x = 5583
    x = 5583 / 3095 
    x = 1.8

4. **Substitute the value of x back into either original equation to solve for p.** Let's use the first equation:
    26 * (1.8) + 29 * p = 107
    46.8 + 29p = 107
    29p = 60.2
    p = 60.2 / 29
    p = 2.076

**Therefore, the solutions are:**

* x = 1.8
* p = 2.076

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this system of equations using elimination:

**1. Multiply the equations to create opposite coefficients for one variable.**

* Multiply the first equation by 10: 
   (290 * l) + (170 * g) = 680
* Multiply the second equation by 17:
   (527 * g) - (170 * l) = 289

**2. Add the two equations together.** This will eliminate 'l'.
   (290 * l) + (170 * g) = 680
   (527 * g) - (170 * l) = 289
   ----------------------
   (697 * g)             = 969

**3. Solve for 'g'.**
   g = 969 / 697
   g = 1.39 (approximately)

**4. Substitute the value of 'g' back into either original equation to solve for 'l'.** Let's use the first equation:

   (29 * l) + (17 * 1.39) = 68
   (29 * l) + 23.63 = 68
   (29 * l) = 44.37
   l = 44.37 / 29
   l = 1.53 (approximately)

**Therefore:**

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We can solve this system of equations using elimination. Here's how:

1. **Multiply the first equation by 26 and the second equation by 54:**
   This will allow us to have coefficients of 'c' that are opposites.

   *  858*a - 1404*c = 520
   * 1296*a - 1404*c = 1566

2. **Subtract the second equation from the first equation:**
   This eliminates 'c'.

   * -438*a = -1046

3. **Solve for 'a':**
   Divide both sides by -438.

   * a = -1046 / -438 = 2.39

4. **Substitute the value of 'a' back into either original equation to solve for 'c'.**
   Let's use the first equation:

   * 33 * 2.39 - 54*c = 20
   * 78.87 - 54*c = 20
   * -54*c = 20 - 78.87 = -58.87
   * c = -58.87 / -54 = 1.09

1. **Multiply equations to make coefficients match:**
    * Multiply the first equation by 43:  
        3053d + 387j = 5676
    * Multiply the second equation by 9: 
        387j - 756d = 819

2. **Subtract the second equation from the first equation:**
    * Notice the 'j' terms have the same coefficient, so they cancel out when subtracting.
    * (3053d + 387j) - (387j - 756d) = 5676 - 819
    * This simplifies to 3809d = 4857

3. **Solve for 'd':**
    * Divide both sides by 3809:

   - Multiply the second equation by 26: (87 * n * 26) + (23 * o * 26) = 143 * 26
* **Subtract the second equation from the first:** 
   - This will eliminate 'n' since the coefficients are now the same but with opposite signs.
   - (81 * o * 87) - (23 * o * 26) = (163 * 87) - (143 * 26)

3. **Solve for 'k':**

   * k = 7843 / 3013 = 2.60 

4. **Substitute the value of 'k' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'b'. Let's use the first equation:**

   * 22 * b + 23 * (2.60) = 109
   * 22 * b + 59.8 = 109
   * 22 * b = 49.2
   * b = 49.2 / 22 = 2.24

Therefore, the values that satisfy the system of equations are:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We can solve this system of equations using elimination. Here's how:

1. **Multiply the second equation by 27.5:** This will make the coefficients of 's' in both equations opposites. 
   (27.5) * (63m - 2s) = (27.5) * 98
   This gives us: 1732.5m - 55s = 2695

2. **Subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:**
   (1732.5m - 55s) - (84m - 55s) = 2695 - 1
   This simplifies to: 1648.5m = 2694

3. **Solve for 'm':**

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We can solve this system of linear equations using a method called elimination. Here's how:

1. **Multiply the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 58:**
   This will allow us to have the coefficients of 'r' in both equations be multiples of each other. 
   - Equation 1: (58 * r + 12 * q = 147) * 76  =&gt;  4408 * r + 912 * q = 11172
   - Equation 2: (97 * q - 76 * r = 76) * 58 =&gt; 5626 * q - 4408 * r = 4408

2. **Add the two modified equations together:**
   Notice that the 'r' terms cancel out:

   -4408 * r + 5626 * q = 4408

3. **Solve for 'q':**
   Divide both sides by 6538:

   q = 2.38 (approximately)

4. **Substitute the value of 'q' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'r'.** Let's use the first equation:

   58 * r + 28.56 = 147

5. **Solve for 'r':**

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve for the values of *u* and *d*:

**1. Elimination Method**

* **Multiply the second equation by 8:** This will allow us to eliminate *u* when we add the equations together.
   (27 * u) + (36 * d) = 71  -&gt;  (8 * 27 * u) + (8 * 36 * d) = (8 * 71) 
   -&gt;  216u + 288d = 568

* **Now we have two equations:**
   * (88 * u) - (96 * d) = 12
   * 216u + 288d = 568

* **Add the two equations together:** Notice that the *u* terms will cancel out.
   (88u + 216u) + (-96d + 288d) = 12 + 568
   304u + 192d = 580

* **Simplify the equation:** Divide both sides by 8.
   38u + 24d = 72.5

* **Now we have a new equation:**

**2. Solving for *u* or *d***

* **Solve the new equation for *u*:**
    * 38u = 72.5 - 24d
    * u = (72.5 - 24d) / 38

**3. Substitution**

* **Substitute the expression for *u* into either of the original equations.** Let's use the first one:
   * (88 * [(72.5 - 24d) / 38]) - (96 * d) = 12

* **Simplify and solve for *d*:**
   * (1980 - 844.8d) / 38 - 96d = 12
   * 1980 - 844.8d - 3648d = 456 
   * -4492.8d = -1524
   * d = -1524 / -4492.8 
   * d = 0.34 (approximately)

**4. Find *u***

* **Substitute the value of *d* back into the equation for *u*:**
   * u = (72.5 - 24 * 0.34) / 38
   * u = (72.5 - 8.16) / 38
   * u = 64.34 / 38
   * u = 1.69 (approximately)

**Therefore:**

   - (-6) * (3n - 2f) = (-6) * 70
   - -18n + 12f = -420

* **Add the modified second equation to the first equation:** This eliminates 'f'.
   - (20n - 18f) + (-18n + 12f) = 9 + (-420)
   - 2n = -411

* **Solve for 'n':**
   - n = -411 / 2
   - n = -205.5

* **Substitute the value of 'n' back into either original equation to solve for 'f'. Let's use the second equation:**
   - 3 * (-205.5) - 2f = 70
   - -616.5 - 2f = 70
   - -2f = 686.5
   - f = -686.5 / 2
   - f = -343.25

**Therefore:**

* n = -205.5
* f = -343.25

### Answer: n = -205.5, f = -343.25

        <pre class="model-raw-response">We can solve for j and l using a method called elimination. Here's how:

1. **Multiply the first equation by 22 and the second equation by -97.** This will allow us to have opposite coefficients for 'j' in both equations.

   *  (7 * l + 97 * j = 133) * 22  =&gt;  154 * l + 2134 * j = 2926
   *  (22 * j + 37 * l = 76) * -97 =&gt; -2134 * j - 3589 * l = -7372

2. **Add the two modified equations together.** This will eliminate 'j' and leave us with an equation with only 'l'.

   * 154 * l + 2134 * j = 2926
   * -2134 * j - 3589 * l = -7372
   * ------------------------
   * -2035 * l = -4446

3. **Solve for 'l'.** Divide both sides of the equation by -2035.

   * l = -4446 / -2035 = 2.18

4. **Substitute the value of 'l' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'j'.** Let's use the first equation.

   * 7 * 2.18 + 97 * j = 133
   * 15.26 + 97 * j = 133
   * 97 * j = 117.74
   * j = 117.74 / 97 = 1.21

   (-79 * h) + (59.25 * o) = -44.4375
   ----------------------------------
   (-1.75 * o) = -35.4375

3. **Solve for 'o':** 
   
   o = -35.4375 / -1.75 = 20.25

4. **Substitute the value of 'o' back into either original equation to solve for 'h'. Let's use the first equation:**

   (79 * h) - (61 * 20.25) = 9
   (79 * h) - 1235.25 = 9
   (79 * h) = 1244.25
   h = 1244.25 / 79 = 15.75

**Therefore:**

* **o = 20.25**
* **h = 15.75**

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve for 's' and 'y' using the elimination method:

1. **Multiply equations to make coefficients match:**
   - Multiply the first equation by 65:  260y + 3640s = 9035
   - Multiply the second equation by 4:   260y - 360s = 64

2. **Subtract the equations:**
   - Notice that the 'y' terms now have the same coefficient. Subtracting the second equation from the first eliminates 'y':
     (260y + 3640s) - (260y - 360s) = 9035 - 64
     4000s = 8971

3. **Solve for 's':**
   - Divide both sides by 4000:
     s = 8971 / 4000
     s = 2.24275

4. **Substitute 's' back into one of the original equations to solve for 'y':**
   - Let's use the first equation:
     4y + 56(2.24275) = 139
     4y + 125.51 = 139
     4y = 13.49

5. **Solve for 'y':**
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     y = 13.49 / 4
     y = 3.3725

**1. Elimination Method**

* **Multiply the first equation by 45 and the second equation by 4:** 
   This will allow us to have the same coefficient for 'z' in both equations but with opposite signs.
   
   * Equation 1 * 45:  1890d - 180z = 3375
   * Equation 2 * 4:   160d + 180z = 648

* **Add the two modified equations together:** This will eliminate 'z'.

   * d = 1.96

* **Substitute the value of 'd' back into either of the original equations to solve for 'z'. Let's use the first equation:**

**1. Simplify the Equations:**

* Equation 1:  42o + 24a = 142
* Equation 2: 42a + 6o = 75

**2. Solve for 'o' in terms of 'a' (or vice versa) in one equation.**

Let's solve Equation 2 for 'o':

* 6o = 75 - 42a
* o = (75 - 42a) / 6 

**3. Substitute the value of 'o' into the other equation.**

Substitute the expression for 'o' into Equation 1:

* 42 * [(75 - 42a) / 6] + 24a = 142

**4. Simplify and solve for 'a'.**

* 7 * (75 - 42a) + 24a = 142
* 525 - 294a + 24a = 142
* -270a = -383
* a = -383 / -270
* a = 1.42 (approximately)

**5. Substitute the value of 'a' back into the equation for 'o'.**

* o = (75 - 42 * 1.42) / 6
* o = (75 - 59.64) / 6

   (-20) * (6z + 58p) = (-20) * (165)
   This simplifies to: -120z - 1160p = -3300

3. **Add the two modified equations together:**
   Notice that the 'z' terms cancel out. 
   (120z - 60p) + (-120z - 1160p) = 153 + (-3300)
   This simplifies to: -1220p = -3147

4. **Solve for 'p':**
   Divide both sides by -1220:
   p = -3147 / -1220
   p = 2.58 (rounded to two decimal places)

5. **Substitute the value of 'p' back into either original equation to solve for 'z'. Let's use the first equation:**
   40z - 20(2.58) = 51
   40z - 51.6 = 51

6. **Solve for 'z':**
   Add 51.6 to both sides:
   40z = 102.6
   Divide both sides by 40:
   z = 2.565 (rounded to three decimal places)

### Answer: z = 2.565, p = 2.58

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the system of equations:

**1. Elimination Method**

* **Multiply the second equation by 8.9:** This will allow us to eliminate 'f' when we add the equations together.
   (3 * f) + (10 * s) = 93  -&gt;  (26.7 * f) + (89 * s) = 827.7 

* **Add the modified second equation to the first equation:**
    (71 * s) - (89 * f) = 5
    (26.7 * f) + (89 * s) = 827.7
    --------------------------
    (160 * s) = 832.7

* **Solve for 's':**
    s = 832.7 / 160
    s = 5.204375

**2. Substitution Method**

* **Solve the second equation for 'f':**
   (3 * f) + (10 * s) = 93
   3 * f = 93 - (10 * s)
   f = (93 - (10 * s)) / 3

* **Substitute the value of 's' into the equation for 'f':**
   f = (93 - (10 * 5.204375)) / 3
   f = (93 - 52.04375) / 3
   f = 40.95625 / 3
   f = 13.65208333

**Therefore:**

* **s = 5.204375**
* **f = 13.65208333**

### Answer: s = 5.204375, f = 13.65208333
