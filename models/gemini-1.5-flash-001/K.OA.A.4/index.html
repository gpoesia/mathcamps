        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">We know that there are 10 pixies in total, and 3 have blue wings.  To find out how many have green wings, we need to subtract the number of blue-winged pixies from the total number of pixies. 

10 pixies - 3 blue-winged pixies = 7 green-winged pixies.
