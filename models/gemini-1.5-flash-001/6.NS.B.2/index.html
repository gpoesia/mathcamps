        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find out how many carrots each plot yielded this year, we need to divide the total number of carrots by the number of plots.

So, each plot yielded 9653 carrots / 58 plots = 166.43 carrots per plot (approximately).

Since we can't have fractions of carrots, we round down to the nearest whole number.

 Therefore, the baker actually used 62118 / 2755 = &lt;&lt;62118/2755=22.55&gt;&gt;22.55 grams of flour each day. 
 
 Since the baker used more flour over a longer period of time, the daily flour usage is lower than previously calculated.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find the number of confetti pieces per square foot, we need to divide the total number of confetti pieces by the total area. 
This can be represented by the equation:  confetti pieces per square foot = total confetti pieces / total area.
Plugging in the values, we get: confetti pieces per square foot = 65325 / 5025.
Therefore, there were 65325/5025 = 13 confetti pieces per square foot.

In this case, the total area is 9944 square feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out the new daily sales, we divide the total number of cameras sold by the new number of days.

So, 54020 cameras / 5546 days = &lt;&lt;54020/5546=9.74 (approximately)&gt;&gt; 9.74 cameras per day (approximately).

Since we can't sell parts of a camera, we can say they sell approximately 10 cameras per day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many pens were produced per hour, we divide the total number of pens by the number of hours. 

2526 pens / 547 hours = &lt;&lt;2526/547=4.62&gt;&gt;4.62 pens per hour.

Since we can't have fractions of pens, we round this number to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, the factory produced approximately 5 pens per hour.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: First, we need to convert kilometers to centimeters. We know that 1 kilometer is equal to 100,000 centimeters. Therefore, 216 kilometers are equal to 216 * 100,000 = 21,600,000 centimeters. 
Now we can set up a proportion: 91368 centimeters / 21,600,000 centimeters = x centimeters / 1 kilometer. 
To solve for x, we cross-multiply: 91368 * 1 = 21,600,000 * x
Simplifying, we get: 91368 = 21,600,000x.
Finally, we divide both sides by 21,600,000 to isolate x: x = 91368 / 21,600,000 = 0.00422222222.
Therefore, 0.00422222222 centimeters on the map represent 1 kilometer in real life.

            In the previous scenario, suppose the hat maker did not have 3560 feathers, but only had 1416 feathers instead. If each hat will still have 890 feathers, how many hats can be produced now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know each hat needs 890 feathers, and we only have 1416 feathers. To find out how many hats can be made, we need to divide the total feathers we have by the number of feathers per hat: 1416 / 890. However, we cannot make a complete hat with less than 890 feathers. So, we need to find the largest whole number that is less than the result of this division.

Since 1416/890 is slightly greater than 1, we can only make **one** complete hat.
