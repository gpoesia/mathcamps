            In a school competition, Aliyah correctly guesses 11 letter games and then correctly guesses 7 more games. But when she guesses the next game, she loses 6 times. What is the total number of letter games Aliyah correctly guessed in the end?

* **Subtract the cherries she ate:** She ate 6 cherries, so there were 15 - 6 = 9 cherries left.
* **Add the new cherries:** She added 8 more cherries, bringing the total to 9 + 8 = 17 cherries.
