            Let's revisit the previous situation where bees were settling in a cluster of trees. Suppose we made a mistake earlier and wrongly counted the bees. In fact, originally, there were 72 bees in the cluster of trees.

Now, similar to the previous situation, after some time, the number of bees in the cluster of trees equals the number of bees from the roses and daisies subtracted from this correct number in the cluster.

Given this correction, how many bees are now left in the cluster of trees?

            In continuation of the previous problem, let's say there was another booth selling kites at the festival. Initially, they had 59 kites.

How many kites did the second booth have left after these sales?

The second booth sold the same number of kites as those remaining from the initial batch, which is 80 kites.
Therefore, the second booth has 59 - 80 = -21 kites left. This means they are short 21 kites.

            There were originally 71 bees in a hive, but 23 flew away in search of flowers. Later, another beekeeper noticed that his hive of 85 bees was missing a few. He discovered that the missing bees were the ones that flew away from the first hive. How many bees are left in the second beekeeper's hive?
