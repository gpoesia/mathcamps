        The perimeter of a rectangular swimming pool is 324 meters. The length of the pool is 83 meters. What is the width of the pool?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by the formula:  Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) We know the perimeter is 324 meters and the length is 83 meters. Let's plug these values into the formula and solve for the width:

324 = 2 * (83 + width)

324 = 166 + 2 * width

324 - 166 = 2 * width

158 = 2 * width

width = 158 / 2

width = 79 meters

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to determine the length of the other side:

1. **Perimeter Formula:** The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides. The formula is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

2. **We know:**
   - Perimeter = 194 cm
   - Length = 49 cm

3. **Let's substitute the known values into the formula:**
   194 = 2 * (49 + width)

4. **Solve for the width:**
   - 194 = 98 + 2 * width
   - 194 - 98 = 2 * width
   - 96 = 2 * width

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
1. We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).
2. We are given the perimeter (282 meters) and the length (71 meters). 
3. Let's substitute these values into the formula: 282 = 2 * (71 + width).
4. Simplifying the equation: 282 = 142 + 2 * width.
5. Subtracting 142 from both sides: 282 - 142 = 2 * width.
6. This gives us: 140 = 2 * width.
7. Dividing both sides by 2: 140 / 2 = width.
8. Therefore, the width (shorter side) is 70 meters.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this:

1. **Perimeter Formula:** The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

2. **Given Information:** We know the perimeter (204m) and one side (16m). 

3. **Let's represent the unknown side:** Let 'w' be the length of the other side (width).

4. **Plug in the values:** 204 = 2 * (16 + w)

5. **Solve for 'w':**
   * 204 = 32 + 2w
   * 172 = 2w
   * w = 86

Therefore, the length of the other side (width) is 86 meters.

2. **Plug in the known values:** We know the perimeter (228 meters) and the length (90 meters). Let 'w' represent the width. So, the equation becomes: 228 = 2 * (90 + w)

3. **Simplify the equation:**  228 = 180 + 2w

4. **Solve for 'w':**
   * Subtract 180 from both sides: 228 - 180 = 2w
   * This simplifies to: 48 = 2w
   * Divide both sides by 2: 48 / 2 = w

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.  We know the lengths of three sides, so to find the length of the fourth side, we subtract the sum of the three known sides from the total perimeter. 

The sum of the three known sides is 35m + 62m + 70m = 167m.

Therefore, the length of the fourth side is 207m - 167m = 40m.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: 
We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
We are given the perimeter (384 cm) and the width (99 cm).  Let's represent the length as 'l'. 
So, we can plug in the values and solve for 'l':
384 = 2 * (l + 99)
192 = l + 99
l = 192 - 99
l = 93 cm

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this:

1. **Perimeter Formula:** The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all four sides.  The formula is: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width).

2. **We know:** 
   - Perimeter = 96 feet
   - One side (length) = 33 feet

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - 96 = 2 * (33 + width)
   - 96 = 66 + 2 * width
   - 96 - 66 = 2 * width
   - 30 = 2 * width
   - width = 30 / 2
   - width = 15 feet

**Therefore, the length of the other pair of opposite sides is 15 feet.**

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. We know one side is 38 feet long, so the opposite side is also 38 feet long.  The total length of these two sides is 38 + 38 = 76 feet.
The total perimeter of the rectangle is 144 feet, and 76 feet of that is accounted for by the two known sides.  That means the remaining two sides must have a total length of 144 - 76 = 68 feet.
Since both of those sides are equal, each side must be 68/2 = 34 feet long.

Let's plug in the values we know:
2 * (65m) + 2 * (width) = 174m
130m + 2 * (width) = 174m

Now let's solve for the width:
2 * (width) = 174m - 130m

        A rectangle has a perimeter of 186cm. If one of its sides is 50cm long, how long is the other side?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can represent the length of the unknown side as 'x'.  

Therefore, the perimeter can be represented as: 50cm + 50cm + x + x = 186cm.

Simplifying the equation: 100cm + 2x = 186cm

Subtracting 100cm from both sides: 2x = 86cm

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 43cm

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve this problem:

1. **Perimeter and Rectangles:** The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its sides.  Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can represent the perimeter as: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

2. **Given Information:** We know the perimeter is 224 cm and one side (length) is 78 cm.

3. **Solve for the Width:**
   *  Let the unknown width be represented by &quot;w&quot;.
   *  Plug in the known values: 224 = 2 * (78 + w)
   *  Simplify: 224 = 156 + 2w
   *  Subtract 156 from both sides: 68 = 2w

        The perimeter of a rectangle is 198 cm. If the length of this rectangle is 90 cm, what is the width?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Understand Perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its sides.  For a rectangle, it's calculated as: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

2. **Set up the Equation:** We know the perimeter (198 cm) and the length (90 cm). Let's represent the width with 'w': 
   198 = 2 * (90 + w)

3. **Solve for the Width:**
   * 198 = 180 + 2w
   * 198 - 180 = 2w
   * 18 = 2w
   * w = 18 / 2
   * w = 9

        Jack is designing a rectangular garden with a total perimeter of 128 feet. He has already planned for one pair of opposite sides to be 47 feet each. What should be the length of the remaining two opposite sides?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The two sides that are 47 feet each add up to 47 * 2 = 94 feet of the total perimeter.
The remaining two opposite sides must add up to 128 - 94 = 34 feet.
Since these two sides are opposite and therefore equal, each side must be 34 / 2 = 17 feet long.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of its four sides.  We know the lengths of three sides, so we can subtract their sum from the total perimeter to find the length of the fourth side. 

The sum of the three known sides is 29m + 16m + 41m = 86m.

Subtracting this sum from the total perimeter gives us 160m - 86m = 74m.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Perimeter and Sides:** The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its sides.  We know the perimeter is 210m.

2. **Known Sides:** We know two sides are 45m each, totaling 45m * 2 = 90m.

3. **Remaining Sides:**  Subtract the known sides from the total perimeter to find the length of the remaining two sides: 210m - 90m = 120m.

4. **Equal Sides:** Since the remaining sides are equal, each side is 120m / 2 = 60m.

### Answer: 60m
