            After reconsidering the data, it was found that the moon's distance to the nearest satellite was actually 5822 kilometers, not 2976 kilometers, but the distance to the farthest remained 2500 kilometers. What would the total distance, in kilometers, covered by the moon to reach the two satellites be considering this new information?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: To find out how many trees are left after the storm, we need to subtract the number of trees lost from the total number of trees.

The farmer had 9942 trees, and he lost 6418 trees, so he has 9942 - 6418 = &lt;&lt;9942-6418=3524&gt;&gt;3524 trees left.

            Let's consider the previous problem, where a farmer had a successful year and harvested 5580 kg of potatoes, with 588 kg being of low quality and couldn't be sold. 

But what if the original harvest was not as bountiful as we first thought, and the farmer only harvested 5080 kg instead of 5580 kg. In this case, keeping the same 588 kg of low quality that couldn't be sold, how many kg of good quality potatoes would the farmer have?
