        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of computers the store has after receiving the new shipment.

Given information:
- The tech store initially had 130 computers in stock.
- The store received a new shipment of 643 computers.

To find the total number of computers, we need to add the initial stock and the new shipment.

Total number of computers = Initial stock + New shipment
Total number of computers = 130 + 643
Total number of computers = 773

Therefore, after receiving the new shipment, the tech store now has 773 computers.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of computers remaining after the purchase rush.

Given information:
- The tech store initially had 130 computers in stock.
- The store received a new shipment of 643 computers.
- After the new shipment, the store had a total of 773 computers.
- During the purchase rush, 186 computers were sold.

To find the number of computers remaining, we need to subtract the number of computers sold from the total number of computers the store had.

Number of computers remaining = Total number of computers - Number of computers sold
Number of computers remaining = 773 - 186
Number of computers remaining = 587

Therefore, after the purchase rush, the tech store has 587 computers left.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate the total number of computers with the updated information.

Given information:
- The tech store initially had 130 computers in stock.
- Instead of receiving 643 computers, the store received an additional 737 computers.

To find the new total number of computers, we need to add the initial stock and the new shipment of 737 computers.

Total number of computers = Initial stock + New shipment
Total number of computers = 130 + 737
Total number of computers = 867

Therefore, if the tech store received an additional shipment of 737 computers instead of 643, the store would have had 867 computers in total.

Given information:
- 645 guests have already confirmed their attendance.
- An additional 24 guests decided to join at the last minute.

Step 1: Add the number of guests who have already confirmed their attendance and the additional guests.
Number of guests expected to attend the party = Guests who have confirmed + Additional guests
Number of guests expected to attend the party = 645 + 24
Number of guests expected to attend the party = 669

Step 1: Add the number of guests who initially confirmed their attendance and the additional guests.
Number of guests expected to attend the party = Guests who initially confirmed + Additional guests
Number of guests expected to attend the party = 830 + 24
Number of guests expected to attend the party = 854

Given information:
- In the morning, Joe used 393 milliliters of toothpaste.
- Later, Joe used 397 milliliters of toothpaste.

Step 1: Add the two amounts of toothpaste used.
Total amount of toothpaste used = Amount used in the morning + Amount used later
Total amount of toothpaste used = 393 milliliters + 397 milliliters
Total amount of toothpaste used = 790 milliliters

Given information:
- Joe used a total of 790 milliliters of toothpaste for the day.
- Joe saved 172 milliliters of toothpaste for the next day.

Step 1: Subtract the amount of toothpaste saved from the total amount used.
Amount of toothpaste used for the day = Total amount used - Amount saved
Amount of toothpaste used for the day = 790 milliliters - 172 milliliters

- Bob sells 382 cookies in the morning.
- A school group buys 33 cookies in the afternoon.

Step 1: Find the number of cookies Bob has left after selling cookies in the morning.
Number of cookies left after the morning = Number of cookies at the start - Number of cookies sold in the morning
Number of cookies left after the morning = 747 - 382 = 365

Step 2: Find the number of cookies Bob has left after the school group's purchase.
Number of cookies left after the school group's purchase = Number of cookies left after the morning - Number of cookies sold to the school group
Number of cookies left after the school group's purchase = 365 - 33 = 332

Given information:
- Bob started with 747 cookies in the bakery.
- Bob sold 711 cookies throughout the day.

To find the number of cookies left, we need to subtract the number of cookies sold from the number of cookies he started with.

Step 1: Find the number of cookies left.
Number of cookies left = Number of cookies at the start - Number of cookies sold
Number of cookies left = 747 - 711
Number of cookies left = 36

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of buttons the snowman has after donating 5 buttons to the squirrel and finding a hidden treasure of 232 more buttons.

Given information:
- The snowman initially had 384 buttons.
- The snowman donated 5 buttons to the squirrel.
- The snowman found a hidden treasure of 232 more buttons.

Step 1: Find the number of buttons the snowman had after donating 5 buttons to the squirrel.
Number of buttons the snowman had initially - Number of buttons donated = Number of buttons left
384 buttons - 5 buttons = 379 buttons

Step 2: Find the total number of buttons the snowman has after finding the hidden treasure.
Number of buttons left + Number of buttons found in the treasure = Total number of buttons
379 buttons + 232 buttons = 611 buttons

Therefore, the snowman has a total of 611 buttons after donating 5 buttons to the squirrel and finding a hidden treasure of 232 more buttons.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sleeping bags Bill has after receiving the new shipment.
Total sleeping bags = Existing stock + New shipment
Total sleeping bags = 167 + 69 = 236

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the expected inventory and the actual inventory.
Sleeping bags missing = Expected inventory - Actual inventory
Sleeping bags missing = 832 - 236 = 596

Step 1: Find the total number of apple trees after planting the additional trees.
Number of initial apple trees + Number of additional apple trees planted = Total number of apple trees
696 + 203 = 899

Step 2: Subtract the number of apple trees cleared from the total number of apple trees.
Total number of apple trees - Number of apple trees cleared = Number of apple trees left

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's continue from the previous scenario.

Given information:
- After buying the gift, you had $133 left in your wallet.
- You found an extra $614 in another compartment of your wallet.

To find the total amount of money you have now in your wallet, we need to add the amount of money you had left after buying the gift ($133) and the extra money you found ($614).

Step 1: Add the amount of money left after buying the gift and the extra money found.
Total amount of money in your wallet = Amount of money left after buying the gift + Extra money found
Total amount of money in your wallet = $133 + $614
Total amount of money in your wallet = $747

Therefore, after finding the extra $614 in another compartment of your wallet, you now have a total of $747 in your wallet.

Given information:
- You initially had $529 in your wallet.
- After buying the gift, you have $378 less.

Step 1: Find the amount of money spent on the gift.
Amount of money spent on the gift = $378

Step 2: Subtract the amount spent on the gift from the updated initial amount of money in the wallet.
Amount of money left = Initial amount of money - Amount spent on the gift
Amount of money left = $529 - $378
Amount of money left = $151

Therefore, with the updated initial amount of $529 in your wallet, and after buying the gift for $378, you now have $151 left.

Given:
- Blaze initially breathed 297 flames per day.
- Due to the unusual planetary alignment, Blaze breathed an additional 586 flames.
- After the resting period, Blaze diminished his flames by 879.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of flames Blaze breathed before the resting period.
Total flames before resting = Initial flames + Additional flames
Total flames before resting = 297 + 586 = 883 flames

Step 2: Calculate the number of flames remaining after diminishing by 879 flames.
Remaining flames = Total flames before resting - Flames diminished
Remaining flames = 883 - 879 = 4 flames

Therefore, after the resting period, during which Blaze cooled down and diminished his flames by 879, there remained 4 flames.

Given information:
- Captain Redbeard found 211 gold coins.
- Captain Redbeard's first mate found 425 gold coins.

To find the total number of gold coins they found on the deserted island, we need to add the number of gold coins found by Captain Redbeard and his first mate.

Step 1: Add the number of gold coins found by Captain Redbeard and his first mate.
Total gold coins found = Gold coins found by Captain Redbeard + Gold coins found by his first mate
Total gold coins found = 211 + 425
Total gold coins found = 636

Therefore, with the updated information, Captain Redbeard and his first mate found a total of 636 gold coins on the deserted island.

Given information:
- There were originally 976 registered dogs in the city.
- 586 dogs moved away with their owners over the year.

Step 1: Find the number of dogs that remained in the city.
Number of dogs that remained = Original number of registered dogs - Number of dogs that moved away

* Originally, there were (976 - 465) registered dogs in the city
* Then, 586 dogs moved away with their owners

To find the number of registered dogs before any dogs moved away, we need to add the number of dogs that moved away (586) to the original number of registered dogs (976 - 465).

Original number of registered dogs = (976 - 465) + 586
Original number of registered dogs = 511 + 586
Original number of registered dogs = 1097

Therefore, before the recent pet adoption event and before any dogs moved away, there were 1097 dogs registered in the city.

Step 1: Find the number of tigers remaining in the first sanctuary after the migration.
Number of tigers remaining in the first sanctuary = Initial number of tigers - Number of tigers that left
Number of tigers remaining in the first sanctuary = 145 - 26 = 119

Step 2: Find the number of tigers in the second sanctuary.
Number of tigers in the second sanctuary = Number of tigers remaining in the first sanctuary
Number of tigers in the second sanctuary = 119

Step 3: Find the total number of tigers in both sanctuaries.
Total number of tigers = Number of tigers in the first sanctuary + Number of tigers in the second sanctuary

Given information:
- The astronaut has 670 kilograms of fuel left.
- The other spaceship needs 937 kilograms of fuel to return to Earth.

To find the additional fuel needed, we need to subtract the amount of fuel the astronaut has left from the amount of fuel the other spaceship needs.

Step 1: Find the additional fuel needed.
Additional fuel needed = Amount of fuel needed by the other spaceship - Amount of fuel the astronaut has left
Additional fuel needed = 937 kilograms - 670 kilograms
Additional fuel needed = 267 kilograms

Therefore, the other spaceship needs an additional 267 kilograms of fuel to return to Earth after using the astronaut's leftover fuel.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the number of penguins that migrated to the colony to the number of penguins that were already in the colony after the initial reduction.

Given information:
- After the initial reduction, there were 257 penguins left in the colony.
- 466 penguins migrated from a different location to join the colony.

Step 1: Add the number of penguins that migrated to the number of penguins already in the colony.
Number of penguins already in the colony + Number of penguins that migrated = Total number of penguins in the colony after migration
257 + 466 = 723

Therefore, there are now 723 penguins in the colony after the migration.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of penguins that decreased (600) from the initial number of penguins (722).

Given information:
- There were initially 722 penguins in the colony.

Step 1: Subtract the number of penguins that decreased from the initial number of penguins.
Initial number of penguins - Number of penguins that decreased = Number of penguins left
722 - 600 = 122

Therefore, if there were initially 722 penguins in the colony and the number decreased by 600, there would have been 122 penguins left in the colony.

Number of pirouettes successfully performed = Total pirouettes in the dance sequence - Number of pirouettes not completed
Number of pirouettes successfully performed = 443 - 165

Given information:
- The farmer had a bumper crop of 999 lemons.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate with the updated initial number of helicopters.

Given information:
- The helicopter company initially had 71 helicopters.
- The company purchased an additional 174 helicopters.

To find the total number of helicopters, we need to add the initial number of helicopters and the number of additional helicopters purchased.

Total number of helicopters = Initial number of helicopters + Additional helicopters purchased
Total number of helicopters = 71 + 174
Total number of helicopters = 245

Therefore, with the updated initial number of 71 helicopters and the purchase of an additional 174 helicopters, the helicopter company now has 245 helicopters.

Step 1: Find the number of pairs of sunglasses left.
Number of pairs of sunglasses left = Updated initial number of pairs - Number of pairs sold

Step 1: Find the total number of shirts by adding the number of shirts of Brand X and Brand Y.
Total number of shirts = Number of shirts of Brand X + Number of shirts of Brand Y

- The store has 89 shirts of Brand X.
- The store has 707 shirts of Brand Y.

Step 1: Find the total number of Brand X and Brand Y shirts.
Total number of Brand X and Brand Y shirts = Number of Brand X shirts + Number of Brand Y shirts
Total number of Brand X and Brand Y shirts = 89 + 707
Total number of Brand X and Brand Y shirts = 796

Step 2: Find the number of shirts that are not of Brand X or Brand Y.
Number of shirts not of Brand X or Brand Y = Total number of shirts - Total number of Brand X and Brand Y shirts
Number of shirts not of Brand X or Brand Y = 980 - 796

To find the total number of shirts the store now has, we need to add the number of shirts of Brand X and Brand Y.

Step 1: Find the total number of shirts by adding the number of shirts of Brand X and Brand Y.
Total number of shirts = Number of shirts of Brand X + Number of shirts of Brand Y
Total number of shirts = 89 + 813

Step 1: Subtract the number of damaged boats from the total number of boats.
Number of boats left in the marina = Total number of boats - Number of damaged boats
Number of boats left in the marina = 729 - 511

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* The original number is 892
* After losing 172, it becomes 892 - 172 = 720
* Another number, 896, loses the same amount as what 892 became (720)

So, we need to find out what 896 becomes after losing 720.

Given:
- Original number = 896
- Amount to be lost = 720

Step 1: Subtract the amount to be lost from the original number.
896 - 720 = 176

Therefore, after losing the same amount as what 892 became (720), the new number is 176.

Step 1: Find the number of tables that remained after discarding the defective ones.
Number of tables remaining = Total tables produced - Number of tables discarded

To find the total number of colored pencils, we need to add the initial stock and the new batch.

Total number of colored pencils = Initial stock + New batch
Total number of colored pencils = 91 + 738

Initially, there were 91 colored pencils in the art class.
Then, a batch of 738 colored pencils was added.
So, the total number of colored pencils became:
91 + 738 = 829 colored pencils

Now, we are given that an additional donation of 67 colored pencils was received.
To find the new total, we need to add this additional donation to the previous total.

Previous total: 829 colored pencils
Additional donation: 67 colored pencils
New total = Previous total + Additional donation
New total = 829 + 67
New total = 896 colored pencils

Therefore, after receiving the additional donation of 67 colored pencils, there are now 896 colored pencils in the art class.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given information:
- The big square has 182 units.
- The smaller square has 557 units.

To find the total units of both squares, we need to add the units of the big square and the smaller square.

Step 1: Add the units of the big square and the smaller square.
Units of the big square + Units of the smaller square = Total units of both squares
182 units + 557 units = 739 units

Therefore, with the updated information, the two squares would have a total of 739 units.

Given information:
- Initially, there are 117 bottles of juice in the store.
- 2 more bottles of the new flavor are added to the collection.

To find the total number of bottles after adding the new flavor, we need to add the initial number of bottles and the number of new bottles.

Total number of bottles = Initial number of bottles + Number of new bottles
Total number of bottles = 117 + 2

- In the morning, there were 471 bottles of juice in the store.
- At the end of the day, after selling some bottles and adding 2 new bottles, there were 119 bottles in the store.

To find the number of bottles sold, we need to subtract the final number of bottles from the initial number of bottles, and then add the number of new bottles added.

Number of bottles sold = Initial number of bottles - Final number of bottles + Number of new bottles added
Number of bottles sold = 471 - 119 + 2

Now, we need to add the additional 208 episodes to the remaining episodes:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given information:
- There were originally 224 oranges in the fruit store.
- A fresh batch of 356 oranges was brought in from the farm.

To find the total number of oranges, we need to add the original number of oranges and the number of oranges in the fresh batch.

Total number of oranges = Original number of oranges + Number of oranges in the fresh batch
Total number of oranges = 224 + 356
Total number of oranges = 580

Therefore, with the fresh batch of 356 oranges, there are now 580 oranges in the store.

- Number of bed-sheets received from the donation = 223

Step 1: Find the number of bed-sheets left after accommodating some participants.
Number of bed-sheets left = Total bed-sheets available - Number of bed-sheets used
Number of bed-sheets left = 628 - 143
Number of bed-sheets left = 485

Step 2: Add the number of bed-sheets received from the donation to the number of bed-sheets left.
Total number of bed-sheets now available = Number of bed-sheets left + Number of bed-sheets received from the donation
Total number of bed-sheets now available = 485 + 223

To find the total number of erasers, we need to add the initial number of erasers and the additional erasers acquired.

Total number of erasers = Initial number of erasers + Additional erasers acquired

To find the total number of erasers Sarah has now, we need to add the number of erasers she had after the first meet (797) to the number of erasers she acquired at the second meet (139).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the initial number of animals and the final number of animals after the exchange.

Given information:
- The zoo had 427 animals last year.
- After the exchange with another zoo, the number of animals became 341.

Step 1: Find the difference between the initial and final number of animals.
Initial number of animals - Final number of animals = Number of animals lost
427 - 341 = 86

Therefore, the zoo lost 86 animals after the exchange.

Given information:
- The zoo had 427 animals last year.
- After the exchange with another zoo, the number of animals became 341.
- There were initially 848 animals in the reserve section of the zoo.

Step 1: Find the number of animals the zoo lost.
Initial number of animals - Final number of animals = Number of animals lost
427 - 341 = 86

Step 2: Subtract the number of animals lost from the animals in the reserve section.
Animals in the reserve section - Animals lost = Remaining animals in the reserve section
848 - 86 = 762

Therefore, after the exchange, there are 762 animals left in the reserve section of the zoo.

            In addition to the sales they had, the local cafe made a mistake and accidentally gave away 50 cups of hot chocolate without charging. How many paid cups of hot chocolate did they actually sell during the winter season?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's revisit this problem with the new information.

Given:
- In November, the cafe sold 193 cups of hot chocolate.
- In December, the cafe sold 696 cups of hot chocolate.
- The cafe accidentally gave away 50 cups of hot chocolate without charging.

To find the total number of paid cups of hot chocolate sold, we need to subtract the number of cups given away from the total cups sold.

Step 1: Calculate the total cups of hot chocolate sold in November and December.
Total cups sold = Cups sold in November + Cups sold in December
Total cups sold = 193 + 696 = 889

Step 2: Subtract the number of cups given away from the total cups sold.
Paid cups of hot chocolate sold = Total cups sold - Cups given away
Paid cups of hot chocolate sold = 889 - 50 = 839

Therefore, the cafe actually sold 839 paid cups of hot chocolate during the winter season after accounting for the 50 cups given away without charging.

Given information:
- The initial population of monkeys in the jungle was 752, and it reduced by 454, leaving 298 monkeys.
- The nearby forest saw the same reduction in monkey population as the jungle.

Step 1: Find the remaining population of monkeys in the nearby forest.
Since the reduction in the forest was the same as in the jungle, the remaining population in the forest will also be 298.

Step 2: Find the total population of monkeys by adding the remaining populations of the jungle and the forest.
Total population = Remaining population in the jungle + Remaining population in the forest
Total population = 298 + 298 = 596

Therefore, when we combine the new populations of both the jungle and the forest, there are 596 monkeys in total.

- The initial population of monkeys in the jungle was 457.
- The monkey population reduced by 454.

Step 1: Subtract the number of monkeys that were reduced from the initial population.
Initial population - Number of monkeys reduced = Remaining population
457 - 454 = 3

Therefore, if the initial population was 457 monkeys and the reduction was 454 monkeys, there would be 3 monkeys left in the jungle.

Step 1: Find the number of aliens remaining after the battle.
Number of aliens remaining = 442 - 408 = 34

Step 2: Calculate the number of aliens after cloning.
Number of aliens after cloning = Number of aliens remaining Ã— 2

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this problem, we need to find out how many precious stones Captain Scallywag has left in his treasure chest after losing 506 stones during the sea-storm.

Given:
- Captain Scallywag initially had 206 sapphires and 312 emeralds in his treasure chest.
- He lost 506 precious stones during the sea-storm.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of precious stones Captain Scallywag had initially.
Total precious stones = Number of sapphires + Number of emeralds
Total precious stones = 206 + 312 = 518

Step 2: Calculate the number of precious stones left after losing 506 stones.
Number of precious stones left = Total precious stones - Number of stones lost
Number of precious stones left = 518 - 506 = 12

Therefore, Captain Scallywag has 12 precious stones left in his treasure chest after the sea-storm.

Step 1: Find the total distance traveled by the spaceship before going backwards.
Total distance traveled before going backwards = 843 light years + 23 light years
Total distance traveled before going backwards = 866 light years

Step 2: Find the net distance traveled by the spaceship after going backwards.
Net distance traveled = Total distance traveled before going backwards - Distance traveled backwards

Given information:
- The farmer had 542 acres of land.

Step 1: Subtract the number of acres sold from the total number of acres.
Total acres - Acres sold = Remaining acres

Given information:
- There are 140 green grapes in one stall.

- 318 grapes were bought by a customer.

Step 1: Find the total number of grapes initially.
Total number of grapes initially = Number of green grapes + Number of red grapes
Total number of grapes initially = 140 + 377
Total number of grapes initially = 517

Step 2: Subtract the number of grapes bought by the customer from the total number of grapes initially.
Number of grapes left = Total number of grapes initially - Number of grapes bought
Number of grapes left = 517 - 318

Step 1: Find the total number of grapes by adding the number of green grapes and the number of red grapes.
Total number of grapes = Number of green grapes + Number of red grapes

- The manufacturer sold 245 pairs of the newly made binoculars.

Step 1: Find the total number of pairs of binoculars after the additional pairs were produced.
Total number of pairs of binoculars = Initial number of pairs + Additional pairs produced
Total number of pairs of binoculars = 338 + 591 = 929

Step 2: Subtract the number of pairs sold from the total number of pairs.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this case, we need to find the total number of dresses Princess Annabelle would have if her stylist added 501 dresses instead of 855 to her initial collection of 121 dresses.

Given information:
- Princess Annabelle initially had 121 dresses in her wardrobe.
- Her stylist added 501 dresses to her collection.

Step 1: Find the total number of dresses by adding the initial number of dresses and the number of dresses added.
Total number of dresses = Initial number of dresses + Number of dresses added
Total number of dresses = 121 + 501
Total number of dresses = 622

Therefore, if the stylist had added 501 dresses instead of 855, Princess Annabelle would have had 622 dresses in her collection.

Previous total number of sharks = 131 (nurse sharks) + 157 (bull sharks) = 288

Step 1: Add the number of great white sharks to the previous total.
Previous total number of sharks + Number of great white sharks = New total number of sharks

- The mermaid had 306 shiny pearls in her collection initially.
- The mermaid gifted 289 pearls to her mermaid friend.

Step 1: Subtract the number of pearls gifted from the initial number of pearls.
Number of pearls left = Initial number of pearls - Number of pearls gifted
Number of pearls left = 306 - 289
Number of pearls left = 17

Therefore, the mermaid has 17 shiny pearls left in her collection after gifting 289 pearls to her friend.

Given information:
- The mermaid originally had 306 shiny pearls.

Step 1: Subtract the number of pearls gifted from the initial number of pearls.
Number of pearls left = Initial number of pearls - Number of pearls gifted

To find the total number of tents in the store, we need to add the number of basic models and the number of advanced models.

Step 1: Add the number of basic models and the number of advanced models.
Total number of tents = Number of basic models + Number of advanced models
Total number of tents = 324 + 303
Total number of tents = 627

Given:

- The total number of carrot plants planted was 746 + 91 = 837.
- After the hailstorm, 83 plants did not survive.

To find the number of carrot plants the farmer has now, we need to subtract the number of plants that did not survive from the total number of plants planted.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of carrot plants planted.
Total number of carrot plants planted = 746 + 91 = 837

Step 2: Subtract the number of plants that did not survive from the total number of plants planted.
Number of carrot plants the farmer has now = Total number of carrot plants planted - Number of plants that did not survive
Number of carrot plants the farmer has now = 837 - 83 = 754

Given information:
- There are 59 ballerinas practicing in the morning session.
- There are 70 ballerinas practicing in the afternoon session.

However, we don't know if there are any ballerinas practicing in both sessions. If there are ballerinas practicing in both sessions, we need to subtract them from the total to avoid double-counting.

Since the question doesn't provide any information about ballerinas practicing in both sessions, we can assume that the morning and afternoon sessions have different sets of ballerinas.

Therefore, to find the total number of ballerinas practicing throughout the day, we can simply add the number of ballerinas in the morning session and the number of ballerinas in the afternoon session.

Total number of ballerinas practicing throughout the day = Number of ballerinas in the morning session + Number of ballerinas in the afternoon session

Given information:

- There were 70 ballerinas practicing in the afternoon session.
- The total number of ballerinas practicing throughout the day was 129 (59 + 70).
- 791 more ballerinas arrived for a special workshop.

To find the total number of ballerinas present for the day's events, we need to add the number of ballerinas practicing throughout the day and the number of additional ballerinas who arrived for the special workshop.

Total number of ballerinas present for the day's events = Number of ballerinas practicing throughout the day + Number of additional ballerinas for the special workshop
Total number of ballerinas present for the day's events = 129 + 791

Given information:
- There are 873 ballerinas practicing in the morning session.
- There are 70 ballerinas practicing in the afternoon session.

Since we still don't have any information about ballerinas practicing in both sessions, we can assume that the morning and afternoon sessions have different sets of ballerinas.

Therefore, to find the total number of ballerinas practicing throughout the day, we can add the number of ballerinas in the morning session and the number of ballerinas in the afternoon session.

Total number of ballerinas practicing throughout the day = Number of ballerinas in the morning session + Number of ballerinas in the afternoon session
Total number of ballerinas practicing throughout the day = 873 + 70

Step 1: Find the new amount of milk after the increase.
New amount of milk = Original amount of milk + Amount of increase
New amount of milk = 658 milliliters + 18 milliliters

4. The baby also needs to consume 67 milliliters of water daily in addition to the milk.

To find the total liquid (milk and water) the baby is consuming every day now, we need to add the amount of milk and the amount of water.

Total liquid consumed = Amount of milk + Amount of water
Total liquid consumed = 676 milliliters + 67 milliliters

Step 1: Calculate the new amount of milk after the increase.
New amount of milk = Initial amount of milk + Amount of increase
New amount of milk = 380 milliliters + 18 milliliters
