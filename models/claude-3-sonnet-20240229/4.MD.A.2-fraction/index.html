        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Steve spent each day, and then calculate how much money John spent. Finally, we can add the remaining money John had and the $25 he found to get the total amount of money he has now.

Given information:
- Steve started with $38 and spent it evenly over 8 days.
- Steve received an extra $11.
- John started with $18.
- John spent the same amount of money as Steve had.
- John found $25 on the street.

Step 1: Find how much money Steve spent each day.
Steve's initial money / Number of days = Money spent per day
$38 / 8 days = $4.75 per day

Step 2: Find the total amount of money Steve had after receiving the extra $11.
Steve's initial money + Extra money received = Total money Steve had
$38 + $11 = $49

Step 3: Find the total amount of money John spent.
Total money Steve had = Total money John spent
$49 = Total money John spent

Step 4: Find the remaining money John had after spending.
John's initial money - Total money John spent = Remaining money
$18 - $49 = -$31 (John had a deficit of $31)

Step 5: Find the total amount of money John has now after finding $25 on the street.
Remaining money + Money found = Total money John has now
-$31 + $25 = -$6

Therefore, John has -$6, which means he is still in debt by $6.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance of Sally's regular bike route and then add the extra distance she traveled on the day she took the detour.

Given information:
- Initially, Sally traveled 47/50 of a mile.
- Then, she rode another 31 miles.
- For the next 28 days, she completed the same distance.
- On one day, she added an extra 32/24 miles to her regular bike route.

Step 1: Find the total distance of Sally's regular bike route.
Distance of the regular bike route = 47/50 + 31 miles
Distance of the regular bike route = 0.94 + 31 miles
Distance of the regular bike route = 31.94 miles

Step 2: Find the total distance Sally traveled for the 28 days on her regular bike route.
Total distance for 28 days = Distance of the regular bike route Ã— 28
Total distance for 28 days = 31.94 miles Ã— 28
Total distance for 28 days = 894.32 miles

Step 3: Find the total distance Sally traveled after adding the extra distance on the day of the detour.
Total distance = Total distance for 28 days + Extra distance on the day of the detour
Total distance = 894.32 miles + 32/24 miles
Total distance = 894.32 miles + 1.33 miles
Total distance = 895.65 miles

Therefore, after adding the extra traveling distance on the day of the detour, Sally traveled a total of 895.65 miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the distance the truck can travel on a liter of fuel, and then use that to calculate the total distance it can travel with the given additional distances.

Given information:
- The truck can travel 34/25 kilometers on a liter of fuel.
- Initially, 11 more kilometers are added to the journey.
- Then, an additional 49 kilometers are added to the journey.

Step 1: Find the distance the truck can travel on a liter of fuel.
Distance per liter of fuel = 34/25 kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel when 11 kilometers are added.
Total distance = Distance per liter of fuel + 11 kilometers
Total distance = 34/25 + 11 kilometers
Total distance = (34/25) + (275/25) kilometers (since 11 = 275/25)
Total distance = 309/25 kilometers
Total distance = 12.36 kilometers

Step 3: Calculate the total distance the truck can travel before running out of fuel when an additional 49 kilometers are added.
Total distance = Distance per liter of fuel + 11 kilometers + 49 kilometers
Total distance = 34/25 + 275/25 + 1225/25 kilometers (since 49 = 1225/25)

Given information:
- The truck can travel a distance of 34/25 kilometers on one liter of fuel.
- The truck can travel a distance of 30 kilometers more than the distance it can cover on one liter of fuel.
- An additional 49 kilometers are added to the journey.

Step 1: Find the distance the truck can travel on one liter of fuel.
Distance on one liter of fuel = 34/25 kilometers

Step 2: Find the total distance the truck can travel before adding the additional 49 kilometers.
Total distance = Distance on one liter of fuel + 30 kilometers
Total distance = 34/25 + 30 kilometers
Total distance = (34/25) + (750/25) kilometers (since 30 = 750/25)
Total distance = 784/25 kilometers
Total distance = 31.36 kilometers

Step 3: Calculate the total distance the truck can travel when an additional 49 kilometers are added.
Total distance = Distance before adding 49 kilometers + 49 kilometers
Total distance = 31.36 kilometers + 49 kilometers
Total distance = 31.36 + (1225/25) kilometers (since 49 = 1225/25)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find John's jogging speed after consuming the energy drink and then calculate the distance he would cover in 46/30 hours.

Given information:
- John's jogging speed increased by 50/49 miles per hour after consuming the energy drink.
- John's jogging speed without the energy drink was 4/22 miles per hour.
- John continued jogging for 46/30 hours after consuming the energy drink.

Step 1: Find John's jogging speed without the energy drink in miles per hour.
John's jogging speed without the energy drink = 4/22 miles per hour
= (4/22) Ã— (1 hour/60 minutes)
= 1/66 miles per minute
= 1/66 Ã— 60 minutes per hour
= 1 mile per hour

Step 2: Find John's jogging speed after consuming the energy drink.
John's jogging speed after consuming the energy drink = John's jogging speed without the energy drink + Increase in speed
John's jogging speed after consuming the energy drink = 1 mile per hour + 50/49 miles per hour
John's jogging speed after consuming the energy drink = (1 + 50/49) miles per hour
John's jogging speed after consuming the energy drink = 99/49 miles per hour

Step 3: Calculate the distance John would cover in 46/30 hours.
Distance covered = Speed Ã— Time
Distance covered = (99/49) miles per hour Ã— (46/30) hours
Distance covered = (99 Ã— 46) / (49 Ã— 30) miles
Distance covered = 4554 / 1470 miles
Distance covered = 3.096 miles (approximately)

Therefore, after consuming the energy drink, John would jog at a rate of approximately 3.096 miles in 46/30 hours.

Given information:
- The truck driver starts with 9 gallons of gas in the tank.
- At the first station, he adds 21/36 gallons of gas.
- At the second station, he adds 26/42 gallons of gas.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimals.
21/36 = 0.583 gallons
26/42 = 0.619 gallons

Step 2: Add the initial amount of gas and the amounts added at the two stations.
Total amount of gas = Initial amount + Amount added at first station + Amount added at second station
Total amount of gas = 9 + 0.583 + 0.619
Total amount of gas = 10.202 gallons

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the value of 47/8 and then add it to the initial amount of $6 that John had in his pocket.

Given information:
- John initially had $6 in his pocket.
- John earned an additional 47/8 dollars from mowing his neighbor's lawn.

Step 1: Convert the fraction 47/8 to a decimal.
47/8 = 47 Ã· 8 = 5.875

Step 2: Add the amount earned to the initial amount John had.

Given information:
- The cost of one barrel of oil is $16.

Step 1: Find the cost of 9 barrels of oil.
Cost of 9 barrels of oil = Cost of one barrel of oil Ã— Number of barrels

Given information:
- Amy's initial garden length is 11 feet.
- She plans to expand it by 30 feet.
- After the first expansion, she decided to further extend the garden by a length equivalent to 30 divided by 13 feet.

Step 1: Find the length of the garden after the first expansion.
Initial length + First expansion = Length after first expansion
11 feet + 30 feet = 41 feet

Step 2: Find the length of the second expansion.
Second expansion = 30 divided by 13 feet
Second expansion = 30 / 13 feet
Second expansion = 2.3076... feet (rounded to 2.31 feet)

Step 3: Find the total length of the garden after all the expansions.
Total length = Length after first expansion + Second expansion
Total length = 41 feet + 2.31 feet
Total length = 43.31 feet

Given information:
- John's house is (17 / 3) miles from his work.
- The supermarket is (25 / 41) miles closer to his work than his house.

Step 1: Find the distance between John's house and his work.
Distance between John's house and his work = (17 / 3) miles
Distance between John's house and his work = 5.67 miles (after simplifying the fraction)

Step 2: Find the distance between the supermarket and his work.
Distance between the supermarket and his work = Distance between John's house and his work - (25 / 41) miles
Distance between the supermarket and his work = 5.67 miles - (25 / 41) miles
Distance between the supermarket and his work = 5.67 miles - 0.61 miles (after simplifying the fraction)
Distance between the supermarket and his work = 5.06 miles

- The bank received a deposit of $36.
- The bank paid out $8.

- The bank then received an uncommon payment of $19/11.

Step 1: Convert the uncommon payment of $19/11 to a decimal value.
$19/11 = 1.727272727...

Step 2: Add the uncommon payment to the existing amount of $40.
$40 + $1.727272727... = $41.727272727...

Since we are dealing with one-dollar bills, we need to round down to the nearest whole dollar amount.

Step 3: Round down the total amount to the nearest whole dollar.
$41.727272727... rounds down to $41.

Therefore, after receiving the uncommon payment of $19/11, the bank now has $41 in one-dollar bills.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the value of 14/19 of a dollar and add it to the initial amount of $37 that James had.

Given information:
- James initially had $37.
- James's little brother gave him 14/19 of a dollar.

Step 1: Convert the fraction 14/19 to a decimal.
14/19 = 0.7368421... (rounded to four decimal places) = 0.7368

Step 2: Convert the decimal value to dollars.
0.7368 Ã— $1 = $0.7368

Step 3: Add the amount received from the little brother to James's initial amount.
James's new amount = Initial amount + Amount received from little brother
James's new amount = $37 + $0.7368
James's new amount = $37.7368

Therefore, after receiving 14/19 of a dollar from his little brother, James now has $37.7368.

- He splits the juice into 17 equal parts.
- He takes the juice from one part and pours it into a container.
- He then takes 34/44 of what is in that container and pours it into another container.

Step 1: Find the amount of juice in one part.

Amount of juice in one part = 50 ounces / 17 parts
Amount of juice in one part = 2.94 ounces (approximately)

Step 2: Find the amount of juice in the first container.
Amount of juice in the first container = Amount of juice in one part
Amount of juice in the first container = 2.94 ounces

Step 3: Calculate 34/44 of the amount of juice in the first container.

            John wants to save some money to buy a video game. The game costs $40, but John already has $29. 

Every week, John is able to save 20/48 of the money he needs. 

After a certain period of time, he decides to put all his savings so far into an investment account. The account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested after a year. 

How much money will John have in his investment account after a year?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money John needs to save, how much he can save each week, and then calculate the total amount he can save before investing it. Finally, we need to calculate the return on his investment after a year.

Given information:
- The video game costs $40.
- John already has $29.
- John needs to save $40 - $29 = $11 more.
- John can save 20/48 of the money he needs each week.
- The investment account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested after a year.

Step 1: Find how much John can save each week.
Amount John needs to save Ã— (20/48) = Amount John can save each week
$11 Ã— (20/48) = $4.58

Step 2: Find the number of weeks it will take John to save the remaining $11.
Amount needed to save / Amount saved per week = Number of weeks
$11 / $4.58 â‰ˆ 2.4 weeks

Since we can't have a fractional week, we'll round up to 3 weeks.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount John will save in 3 weeks.
Amount saved per week Ã— Number of weeks = Total amount saved
$4.58 Ã— 3 = $13.74

Step 4: Calculate the return on John's investment after a year.
Total amount saved Ã— (41/11) = Return on investment after a year
$13.74 Ã— (41/11) = $51.54

Therefore, after a year, John will have $51.54 in his investment account.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
13/3 = (13 Ã— 5)/15 = 65/15 euros
32/15 euros

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the candy bar from the initial amount of money Maria had.
Initial amount of money - Cost of the candy bar = Amount of money left
65/15 - 32/15 = (65 - 32)/15 = 33/15 euros

- The candy bar costs 32/15 euros.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
36/3 = (36 Ã— 5)/15 = 180/15 euros
32/15 euros

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the candy bar from the initial amount of money Maria had.
Initial amount of money - Cost of the candy bar = Amount of money left
180/15 - 32/15 = (180 - 32)/15 = 148/15 euros

Therefore, if Maria initially starts with 36/3 euros in her pocket and buys the same candy bar that costs 32/15 euros, she would have 148/15 euros left.

Speed for the first part = 34 miles / 14 hours
Speed for the first part = 2.43 miles per hour

Step 2: Find the speed of the sprinter for the second part of the race.

Step 1: Convert the fraction 37/33 to a decimal value.
37/33 = 1.121212...

Step 2: Add the additional amount earned to the initial amount of $69.
Initial amount + Additional amount earned = Total amount of money Tom has now
$69 + $1.121212... = $70.121212...

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step:

Given:
- Initially, John had $3 in his wallet.
- John found a $33 bill on the floor.

To find the total amount of money John had before buying the video game, we need to add the initial amount he had in his wallet ($3) to the amount he found on the floor ($33).

Step 1: Add the initial amount in John's wallet to the amount he found on the floor.
Initial amount in John's wallet + Amount found on the floor = Total amount before buying the video game
$3 + $33 = $36

Therefore, if John initially had $3 in his wallet before finding the $33 bill, he would have had $36 before buying the video game.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Carrie rode her bike and then multiply it by the distance covered per hour.

Given information:
- Carrie rode her bike for 7 hours.
- Carrie rode her bike for an additional 38/25 of an hour.
- Carrie covered 35 kilometers in each hour.

Step 1: Convert the fraction 38/25 to a decimal.
38/25 = 1.52 hours

Step 2: Find the total time Carrie rode her bike.
Total time = 7 hours + 1.52 hours
Total time = 8.52 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered by multiplying the total time by the distance covered per hour.
Total distance = Total time Ã— Distance covered per hour
Total distance = 8.52 hours Ã— 35 kilometers/hour
Total distance = 298.2 kilometers

- Carrie rode her bike for an additional 7/25 of an hour.
- Carrie covered 35 kilometers in each hour.

Step 1: Convert the fraction 7/25 to a decimal.
7/25 = 0.28 hours

Step 2: Find the total time Carrie rode her bike.
Total time = 7 hours + 0.28 hours
Total time = 7.28 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered by multiplying the total time by the distance covered per hour.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of pamphlets Joe had to destroy from the total number of pamphlets he distributed in 19 days.

Given information:
- Joe distributed 40 pamphlets each day.
- After 19 days, Joe had distributed a total of 760 pamphlets (40 pamphlets Ã— 19 days).
- Joe had to destroy 5 pamphlets that were initially considered distributed.

Step 1: Find the total number of pamphlets distributed after accounting for the destroyed pamphlets.
Total number of pamphlets distributed - Number of pamphlets destroyed = Actual number of pamphlets distributed
760 pamphlets - 5 pamphlets = 755 pamphlets

Therefore, after accounting for the 5 pamphlets that were destroyed, Joe has actually distributed 755 pamphlets.

Given information:
- Joe was supposed to distribute 27 pamphlets each day.
- We need to find the total number of pamphlets he should have distributed after 19 days.

Step 1: Find the number of pamphlets Joe should have distributed in 19 days.
Number of pamphlets to be distributed per day Ã— Number of days = Total number of pamphlets to be distributed
27 pamphlets Ã— 19 days = 513 pamphlets

Since Joe initially distributed 40 pamphlets per day, which was incorrect, he had to destroy those pamphlets.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of acres that were not left fallow and then multiply it by the yield per acre.

Given information:
- The farmer harvested 16/5 bushels of corn per acre.
- The farmer has 42 acres of land.
- The farmer has to let 49/4 acres lie fallow (not cultivated).

Step 1: Convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions.
16/5 = (16 Ã— 1 + 0) / 5 = 16/5
49/4 = (49 Ã— 1 + 0) / 4 = 49/4

Step 2: Find the number of acres that were not left fallow.
Total acres - Fallow acres = Acres cultivated
42 - 49/4 = 42 - 12.25 = 29.75 acres

Step 3: Calculate the total bushels of corn harvested from the cultivated land.
Bushels of corn harvested = Acres cultivated Ã— Yield per acre
Bushels of corn harvested = 29.75 Ã— 16/5

Given information:
- The farmer harvested 16/5 bushels of corn per acre.
- The farmer initially had 30 acres of land.
- The farmer has to let 49/4 acres lie fallow (not cultivated).

Step 1: Convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions.
16/5 = (16 Ã— 1 + 0) / 5 = 16/5
49/4 = (49 Ã— 1 + 0) / 4 = 49/4

Step 2: Find the number of acres that were not left fallow.
Total acres - Fallow acres = Acres cultivated
30 - 49/4 = 30 - 12.25 = 17.75 acres

Step 3: Calculate the total bushels of corn harvested from the cultivated land.

Given information:
- Every jug contains 21 gallons of lemonade.
- After selling a jug, Jennifer receives 31/34 of the original volume due to evaporation.

Step 1: Find the volume of lemonade remaining after selling a full jug.
Volume of lemonade remaining = Original volume Ã— (31/34)
Volume of lemonade remaining = 21 gallons Ã— (31/34)
Volume of lemonade remaining = (21 Ã— 31) / 34 gallons
Volume of lemonade remaining = 651 / 34 gallons
Volume of lemonade remaining = 19.15 gallons

Step 1: Find the distance Jane cycled in 45 hours.
Distance cycled in 45 hours = Rate Ã— Time
Distance cycled in 45 hours = 11 km/h Ã— 45 hours
Distance cycled in 45 hours = 495 km

Step 2: Add the additional 1 km to the distance cycled in 45 hours.
Total distance cycled = Distance cycled in 45 hours + Additional distance
Total distance cycled = 495 km + 1 km
Total distance cycled = 496 km

Given information:
- Jane cycled a total of 496 km.
- Jane needs to travel an additional 30 km to get the object.

Step 1: Find the total distance Jane needs to travel, including the additional 30 km.
Total distance = Distance cycled + Additional distance to get the object
Total distance = 496 km + 30 km
Total distance = 526 km

Since Jane needs to travel back to her starting point after getting the object, the object is located at half the total distance from her starting point.

Step 2: Calculate the distance of the object from Jane's starting point.
Distance of the object from the starting point = Total distance / 2
Distance of the object from the starting point = 526 km / 2
Distance of the object from the starting point = 263 km

Therefore, the object is located 263 km away from Jane's starting point.

Step 1: Find the value of the bundle of change.
Value of the bundle of change = $21/39

Step 2: Add the value of the bundle of change to the amount of money George initially had.
Total amount of money George has now = Amount of money in his wallet + Value of the bundle of change
Total amount of money George has now = $21 + ($21/39)
Total amount of money George has now = $21 + $0.54 (rounded to two decimal places)

Given:

- John biked 41 miles from the town of Baker to the town of Nelson.

To find the total distance John biked when he reached the town of Nelson, we need to add the distance from his starting point to Baker, and the distance from Baker to Nelson.

Step 1: Calculate the distance from the starting point to Baker.
Distance to Baker = 8 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance from Baker to Nelson.
Distance from Baker to Nelson = 41 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance by adding the two distances.
Total distance = Distance to Baker + Distance from Baker to Nelson
Total distance = 8 miles + 41 miles
Total distance = 49 miles

41/48 of a dollar = 41/48 Ã— $1 = $0.854166...
23/24 of a dollar = 23/24 Ã— $1 = $0.958333...

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Jack has after earning from recycling cans.
Initial amount + Amount earned from recycling cans = Total amount after recycling cans
$38 + $0.854166... = $38.854166...

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Jack has after finding the quarter.
Total amount after recycling cans + Amount found on the ground = Total amount after finding the quarter
$38.854166... + $0.958333... = $39.8125

Therefore, Jack now has $39.8125.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find Jenny's original speed in miles per hour and then calculate the new speed after increasing it by a factor of 43/15. Finally, we can use the new speed and the total time traveled to find the distance she could travel.

Given information:
- Jenny drove for a total of 29 hours.
- Jenny's original speed was 32/24 miles per hour.
- Jenny's speed increased by a factor of 43/15.

Step 1: Find Jenny's original speed in miles per hour.
Jenny's original speed = 32/24 miles per hour
Jenny's original speed = 4/3 miles per hour
Jenny's original speed = 1.33 miles per hour

Step 2: Find Jenny's new speed after increasing it by a factor of 43/15.
New speed = Original speed Ã— (43/15)
New speed = 1.33 miles per hour Ã— (43/15)
New speed = 1.33 miles per hour Ã— 2.87
New speed = 3.82 miles per hour

Step 3: Calculate the distance Jenny could travel with the new speed and the total time traveled.
Distance = Speed Ã— Time
Distance = 3.82 miles per hour Ã— 29 hours
Distance = 110.78 miles

Therefore, Jenny could travel 110.78 miles if her speed increased by a factor of 43/15.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Tom spent moving the rocks and then multiply it by his speed to find the total distance covered.

Given information:
- Tom moved the first rock for 20/50 hours.
- Tom moved the second rock for 45/36 hours.
- Tom's speed is 25/22 miles per hour.

Step 1: Convert the time intervals to a common denominator.
Time for the first rock = (20/50) Ã— (36/36) = 14.4/180 hours
Time for the second rock = (45/36) Ã— (50/50) = 62.5/180 hours

Step 2: Find the total time Tom spent moving the rocks.
Total time = Time for the first rock + Time for the second rock
Total time = 14.4/180 hours + 62.5/180 hours
Total time = 76.9/180 hours

Step 3: Convert Tom's speed to a common denominator with the total time.
Speed = (25/22) Ã— (180/180) = 202.5/180 miles per hour

Step 4: Calculate the total distance covered.

Given information:
- The scientist mixes 10/42 liters of solution A and 32 liters of solution B.
- She removes 4/28 liters from the mixture.
- She wants to extract 11/29 of the remaining mixture for an experiment.

Step 1: Find the total amount of the mixture initially created.
Total amount of the mixture = 10/42 liters + 32 liters
Total amount of the mixture = (10/42) + (32 Ã— 42/42) liters
Total amount of the mixture = 10 + 1344/42 liters
Total amount of the mixture = 1354/42 liters

Step 2: Subtract the amount removed from the total amount of the mixture.
Amount removed = 4/28 liters
Amount removed = (4/28) Ã— (42/42) liters
Amount removed = 6 liters
Remaining amount of the mixture = 1354/42 liters - 6 liters
Remaining amount of the mixture = (1354 - 252)/42 liters
Remaining amount of the mixture = 1102/42 liters

Step 3: Calculate 11/29 of the remaining mixture.
11/29 of the remaining mixture = (11/29) Ã— (1102/42) liters
11/29 of the remaining mixture = 418/1218 liters

Therefore, the scientist is using 418/1218 liters of the solution for her experiment.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of juice in the two containers, then subtract the amount drunk by the customer from the capacity of the bottle.

Given information:
- The first container contains 23/35 gallon of juice.
- The second container contains 50/41 gallon of juice.
- The bottle can hold 28 gallons.
- A customer drank 11/19 gallon of juice.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to a common denominator.
23/35 gallon = (23 Ã— 41) / (35 Ã— 41) = 943/1435 gallon
50/41 gallon = (50 Ã— 35) / (41 Ã— 35) = 1750/1435 gallon
11/19 gallon = (11 Ã— 35) / (19 Ã— 35) = 385/665 gallon

Step 2: Find the total amount of juice in the two containers.
Total amount of juice = 943/1435 + 1750/1435 = 2693/1435 gallon

Step 3: Convert the total amount of juice to the same denominator as the capacity of the bottle.
2693/1435 gallon = (2693 Ã— 28) / (1435 Ã— 28) = 75404/40180 gallon

Step 4: Subtract the amount of juice drunk by the customer from the capacity of the bottle.
Capacity of the bottle = 28 gallons = 40180/40180 gallon
Amount of juice drunk by the customer = 385/665 gallon = (385 Ã— 40180) / (665 Ã— 40180) = 23105/40180 gallon
Space left in the bottle = 40180/40180 - 23105/40180 = 17075/40180 gallon

Step 5: Convert the remaining space to a proper fraction.
17075/40180 = 17075 Ã· 40180 = 0.425 gallon

Therefore, the space left in the bottle after subtracting 11/19 gallon which was drunk by the customer is 0.425 gallon.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the distance the drone can fly with the package, and then add the additional distance it can fly with the booster.

Given information:
- The drone can fly 3 kilometers without any attachments.
- When carrying a delivery package, the drone can fly 50/43 kilometers less.
- With an additional booster, the drone can fly an additional 47/15 kilometers.

Step 1: Find the distance the drone can fly with the package.
Distance the drone can fly without the package = 3 kilometers
Distance the drone can fly with the package = 3 - (50/43) kilometers
Distance the drone can fly with the package = 3 - (50/43)
Distance the drone can fly with the package = 3 - 1.16 kilometers
Distance the drone can fly with the package = 1.84 kilometers

Step 2: Find the additional distance the drone can fly with the booster.
Additional distance the drone can fly with the booster = 47/15 kilometers
Additional distance the drone can fly with the booster = 3.13 kilometers

Step 3: Find the total distance the drone can fly with the package and the booster.
Total distance = Distance with the package + Additional distance with the booster
Total distance = 1.84 kilometers + 3.13 kilometers
Total distance = 4.97 kilometers

Given information:
- Ann runs 43/18 kilometers every morning.
- Ann runs 22/9 kilometers every evening.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimals.
43/18 = 2.389 kilometers (morning)
22/9 = 2.444 kilometers (evening)

Step 2: Add the distances for morning and evening.
Total distance run in a day = Distance run in the morning + Distance run in the evening
Total distance run in a day = 2.389 kilometers + 2.444 kilometers
Total distance run in a day = 4.833 kilometers

Given information:
- John drove 18 miles each hour for 36 hours.
- After that, he drove an extra distance of 32/45 miles.

Step 1: Find the distance John drove in the first 36 hours.
Distance driven in 36 hours = Speed Ã— Time
Distance driven in 36 hours = 18 miles/hour Ã— 36 hours
Distance driven in 36 hours = 648 miles

Step 2: Find the total distance John drove by adding the distance driven in 36 hours and the extra distance.
Total distance driven = Distance driven in 36 hours + Extra distance
Total distance driven = 648 miles + 32/45 miles
Total distance driven = 648 + (32/45) miles

Step 3: Convert the fraction 32/45 to a decimal.
32/45 = 0.7111... â‰ˆ 0.71 miles

Given information:
- John originally had saved $26 for a new toy.
- John accidentally lost $19.

Step 1: Find the amount of money John has left.
Amount of money John had saved - Amount of money John lost = Amount of money John has left
$26 - $19 = $7

Therefore, with the updated information that John originally had saved $26, and he lost $19, he would have $7 left.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to convert all the given quantities to the same unit of measurement, and then add them together.

Given information:
- Richard bought a bottle of wine with 33 ounces.
- He drank 33/48 of the wine.
- He drank a cup of orange juice containing 26/30 of a liter.
- He drank a bottle of water containing 2/36 of a liter.

Step 1: Convert the volume of wine consumed to liters.
33/48 of 33 ounces = (33/48) Ã— (33/33.814) liters = 0.6875 liters (1 ounce â‰ˆ 0.033814 liters)

Step 2: Convert the volume of orange juice to liters.
26/30 of a liter = 0.8667 liters

Step 3: Convert the volume of water to liters.
2/36 of a liter = 0.0556 liters

Step 4: Calculate the total volume of liquid consumed by adding the volumes.
Total volume of liquid consumed = Volume of wine + Volume of orange juice + Volume of water
Total volume of liquid consumed = 0.6875 liters + 0.8667 liters + 0.0556 liters
Total volume of liquid consumed = 1.6098 liters

Therefore, the total volume of liquid that Richard consumed is 1.6098 liters.

- He receives an additional $27/9 from his aunt.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Jacob has after adding $46 to his initial balance.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of John's apple consumption and apple juice consumption, and then compare them.

Given information:
- John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days.
- John consumes 48 ounces of apple juice every 42 days.

Step 1: Convert the units to a common unit for easier comparison.
1 pound = 16 ounces
17 pounds of apples = 17 Ã— 16 ounces = 272 ounces of apples

Step 2: Find the rate of apple consumption.
Rate of apple consumption = Amount of apples consumed / Time period
Rate of apple consumption = 272 ounces / 8 days = 34 ounces per day

Step 3: Find the rate of apple juice consumption.
Rate of apple juice consumption = Amount of apple juice consumed / Time period
Rate of apple juice consumption = 48 ounces / 42 days = 1.14 ounces per day

Step 4: Compare the rates by dividing the rate of apple consumption by the rate of apple juice consumption.
Rate of apple to apple juice consumption = Rate of apple consumption / Rate of apple juice consumption
Rate of apple to apple juice consumption = 34 ounces per day / 1.14 ounces per day
Rate of apple to apple juice consumption = 29.82

Therefore, John's rate of apple consumption is 29.82 times higher than his rate of apple juice consumption.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total miles Maria drove and the remaining amount of money she had for gas, and then add them together.

Given information:
- Maria drove her car for 8 hours at a speed of 4/7 miles per hour.
- In another trip, she initially had $38 for gas but spent $50/4 on gas.

Step 1: Find the total miles Maria drove.
Speed = 4/7 miles per hour
Time = 8 hours
Total miles driven = Speed Ã— Time
Total miles driven = (4/7) Ã— 8 = 32/7 miles

Step 2: Find the remaining amount of money Maria had for gas.
Initial amount of money for gas = $38
Amount spent on gas = $50/4 = $12.50
Remaining amount of money for gas = Initial amount - Amount spent
Remaining amount of money for gas = $38 - $12.50 = $25.50

Step 3: Find the summation of the total miles driven and the remaining amount of money for gas.
Summation = Total miles driven + Remaining amount of money for gas
Summation = (32/7) + $25.50
Summation = (32/7) + (178/7)
Summation = 210/7

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to convert the given fractions into decimal values and then add them together.

Given information:
- John traveled for 1/31 of an hour by car.
- John took a bus for another 30/12 hours.
- John took a short break of 17/4 hours.

Step 1: Convert the fractions into decimal values.
1/31 of an hour = 1/31 Ã— 60 minutes = 1.93548387 minutes = 0.032258065 hours
30/12 hours = 2.5 hours
17/4 hours = 4.25 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total time John was on the move.
Total time on the move = Time traveled by car + Time traveled by bus
Total time on the move = 0.032258065 hours + 2.5 hours
Total time on the move = 2.532258065 hours

Step 3: Convert the total time on the move from hours to hours and minutes.
2.532258065 hours = 2 hours + (0.532258065 Ã— 60 minutes)
2.532258065 hours = 2 hours + 31.93548387 minutes

Given information:
- The initial distance of the well from the village is 45 miles.
- Every hour, the donkey can carry water back from the well, reducing the effective distance by 18/33 miles.

Step 1: Find the reduction in the effective distance after 1 hour.
Reduction in the effective distance = 18/33 miles

Step 2: Calculate the effective distance of the well from the village after 1 hour.
Effective distance after 1 hour = Initial distance - Reduction in the effective distance
Effective distance after 1 hour = 45 miles - (18/33 miles)
Effective distance after 1 hour = 45 miles - (18/33 Ã— 1 miles)
Effective distance after 1 hour = 45 miles - (6/11 miles)
Effective distance after 1 hour = (495/11 - 6/11) miles
Effective distance after 1 hour = 489/11 miles

- The effective distance of the first well from the first village is 489/11 miles after one hour (from the previous question).
- The effective distance of the second well from the second village is also 45 - (18/33) miles after one hour.

Step 1: Calculate the effective distance of the second well from the second village after one hour.
Effective distance of the second well = 45 miles - (18/33 miles)
Effective distance of the second well = 45 miles - (18/33 Ã— 1 miles)
Effective distance of the second well = 45 miles - (6/11 miles)
Effective distance of the second well = (495/11 - 6/11) miles
Effective distance of the second well = 489/11 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total effective distance the resident would have to travel to retrieve water from both wells.
Total effective distance = Effective distance of the first well + Effective distance of the second well
Total effective distance = 489/11 miles + 489/11 miles
Total effective distance = 978/11 miles

Therefore, the total effective distance the resident would have to travel to retrieve water from both wells after one hour is 978/11 miles.

Given information:
- The initial distance of the well from the village is 45 miles.

Step 1: Find the reduction in the effective distance after 1 hour.
Reduction in the effective distance = 16/33 miles

Step 2: Calculate the effective distance of the well from the village after 1 hour.
Effective distance after 1 hour = Initial distance - Reduction in the effective distance
Effective distance after 1 hour = 45 miles - (16/33 miles)
Effective distance after 1 hour = 45 miles - (16/33 Ã— 1 miles)
Effective distance after 1 hour = 45 miles - (8/17 miles)
Effective distance after 1 hour = (765/17 - 8/17) miles
Effective distance after 1 hour = 757/17 miles

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance John walked in 2 weeks and then add the remaining distance he needed to walk to reach his destination.

Given information:
- John walked 10 miles every day for 2 weeks.
- After 2 weeks, he still needed to walk an additional 21 miles to reach his destination.

Step 1: Find the total distance John walked in 2 weeks.
Distance walked per day = 10 miles
Number of days in 2 weeks = 14 days (2 weeks Ã— 7 days per week)
Total distance walked in 2 weeks = Distance walked per day Ã— Number of days
Total distance walked in 2 weeks = 10 miles Ã— 14 days = 140 miles

Step 2: Find the total distance John had to walk by adding the remaining distance to the distance walked in 2 weeks.
Total distance to walk = Total distance walked in 2 weeks + Remaining distance
Total distance to walk = 140 miles + 21 miles = 161 miles

Therefore, John had to walk a total of 161 miles to reach his destination.

Given information:
- John walked 14 miles every day for 7 weeks.
- After 7 weeks, he still needed to walk an additional 21 miles to reach his destination.

Step 1: Find the total distance John walked in 7 weeks.
Distance walked per day = 14 miles
Number of days in 7 weeks = 49 days (7 weeks Ã— 7 days per week)
Total distance walked in 7 weeks = Distance walked per day Ã— Number of days
Total distance walked in 7 weeks = 14 miles Ã— 49 days = 686 miles

Step 2: Find the total distance John had to walk by adding the remaining distance to the distance walked in 7 weeks.
Total distance to walk = Total distance walked in 7 weeks + Remaining distance
Total distance to walk = 686 miles + 21 miles = 707 miles

Therefore, John had to walk a total of 707 miles to reach his destination this time.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the toy, including the tax, and then subtract it from the amount of money Susan had initially.

Given information:
- Susan has $48 in her pocket.
- The cost of the toy is $18.
- The tax on the toy is $41/14 (or $2.93 when converted to a decimal).

Step 1: Find the total cost of the toy, including the tax.
Cost of the toy + Tax = Total cost
$18 + $2.93 = $20.93

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Susan had initially.
Amount of money Susan had - Total cost = Amount of money left
$48 - $20.93 = $27.07

Given information:
- The farmer harvests 44/10 kilograms of honey from each beehive per day.
- There are 37 beehives.
- The farmer sells 3/37 of the total honey harvested in a day.

Step 1: Find the total amount of honey harvested in a day.
Amount of honey harvested from each beehive per day = 44/10 kilograms = 4.4 kilograms
Total amount of honey harvested in a day = Amount of honey harvested from each beehive Ã— Number of beehives
Total amount of honey harvested in a day = 4.4 kilograms Ã— 37 beehives
Total amount of honey harvested in a day = 162.8 kilograms

Step 2: Find the amount of honey sold in a day.
Amount of honey sold in a day = 3/37 Ã— Total amount of honey harvested in a day
Amount of honey sold in a day = 3/37 Ã— 162.8 kilograms
Amount of honey sold in a day = 13.2 kilograms

Therefore, the farmer harvests 162.8 kilograms of honey in a day, and he sells 13.2 kilograms of honey.

Given information:

- There are now 6 beehives.
- The farmer sells 3/37 of the total honey harvested in a day.

Step 1: Find the total amount of honey harvested from 6 beehives in a day.
Amount of honey harvested from each beehive per day = 44/10 kilograms = 4.4 kilograms
Total amount of honey harvested from 6 beehives in a day = Amount of honey harvested from each beehive Ã— Number of beehives
Total amount of honey harvested from 6 beehives in a day = 4.4 kilograms Ã— 6 beehives
Total amount of honey harvested from 6 beehives in a day = 26.4 kilograms

Step 2: Find the amount of honey sold in a day.
Amount of honey sold in a day = 3/37 Ã— Total amount of honey harvested from 6 beehives in a day
Amount of honey sold in a day = 3/37 Ã— 26.4 kilograms

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Jessie saves after 13 weeks, given that each week she saves an amount equal to the sum of her initial savings ($34) and the money she received from her grandma ($20).

Given information:
- Jessie's initial savings = $34
- Money received from grandma = $20
- Number of weeks Jessie saves = 13
- Each week, Jessie saves an amount equal to $34 + $20 = $54

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Jessie saves in one week.
Amount saved in one week = $54

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Jessie saves after 13 weeks.
Total amount saved = Amount saved in one week Ã— Number of weeks
Total amount saved = $54 Ã— 13
Total amount saved = $702

Therefore, Jessie saves a total of $702 after 13 weeks.

Given information:
- Jessie initially has $45 in savings.
- Jessie receives $20 from her grandma.

To find the total amount of money Jessie has now, we need to add the initial amount in savings to the amount received from her grandma.

Step 1: Add the initial amount in savings to the amount received from her grandma.
Amount of money Jessie has now = Initial amount in savings + Amount received from grandma
Amount of money Jessie has now = $45 + $20
Amount of money Jessie has now = $65

Given information:
- The man spent $43 on groceries.
- He received a discount of $43/27 on the groceries.
- He bought a book worth $13/36.

Step 1: Find the amount paid for groceries after the discount.
Amount paid for groceries = Cost of groceries - Discount
Amount paid for groceries = $43 - ($43/27)
Amount paid for groceries = $43 - $1.59 (rounded to two decimal places)
Amount paid for groceries = $41.41

Step 2: Find the total amount spent by adding the cost of the book.
Total amount spent = Amount paid for groceries + Cost of the book
Total amount spent = $41.41 + ($13/36)

Given information:
- Jenna saved $45 from her part-time job.
- Jenna received $50 as a gift from her parents.
- The cost of the novel is 46/39 dollars.

Step 1: Find the total amount of money Jenna had initially.
Total money = Money saved from part-time job + Money received as a gift
Total money = $45 + $50 = $95

Step 2: Convert the cost of the novel from a fraction to a decimal.
Cost of the novel = 46/39 dollars
Cost of the novel = $1.18 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Jenna has left after buying the novel.
Money left = Total money - Cost of the novel
Money left = $95 - $1.18 = $93.82

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow the given steps and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- Initially, there are 27/6 gallons of water in the tank.
- 5/40 gallons of water are poured out from the tank.
- 21/26 gallons of water are added to the tank.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
27/6 = 135/30 gallons (initially in the tank)
5/40 = 3/24 gallons (poured out)
21/26 = 21/26 gallons (added)

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water remaining after pouring out.
Amount of water remaining = Initial amount - Amount poured out
Amount of water remaining = 135/30 - 3/24 gallons
Amount of water remaining = (135 Ã— 4 - 3 Ã— 5) / 120 gallons
Amount of water remaining = 537/120 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water after adding 21/26 gallons.
Total amount of water = Amount of water remaining + Amount added
Total amount of water = 537/120 + 21/26 gallons
Total amount of water = (537 Ã— 13 + 21 Ã— 55) / (120 Ã— 13) gallons
Total amount of water = 7002/1560 gallons

Step 4: Convert the fraction to a mixed number.
7002/1560 = 4 49/78 gallons

Therefore, after all the actions, there are 4 49/78 gallons of water in the tank.

To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the distance traveled in the first 20 hours and the additional distance traveled.

Total distance traveled = Distance traveled in 20 hours + Additional distance traveled

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the cost per bag for each vendor and then calculate the difference.

Given information:
- Current vendor: $34 for 8 bags
- New vendor: $19 for 30 bags

Step 1: Find the cost per bag for the current vendor.
Cost per bag for the current vendor = $34 / 8 bags = $4.25 per bag

Step 2: Find the cost per bag for the new vendor.
Cost per bag for the new vendor = $19 / 30 bags = $0.63 per bag

Step 3: Find the difference between the cost per bag for the current vendor and the new vendor.
Difference in cost per bag = Cost per bag for the current vendor - Cost per bag for the new vendor
Difference in cost per bag = $4.25 - $0.63 = $3.62 per bag

Therefore, the new vendor charges $3.62 less per bag compared to the current vendor.

Since the duration is &quot;over 46 days,&quot; we can assume it is at least 47 days.

Total amount spent = $50
Number of days = 47 days (minimum)

Amount spent per day = Total amount spent / Number of days

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the fraction of the bottle that 18/4 represents and then multiply it by the total amount of juice in the bottle (22/43 liters).

Given information:
- The bottle contains 22/43 liters of juice.
- You drink 18/4 of the bottle.

Step 1: Convert 18/4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 43.
18/4 = (18/4) Ã— (43/43) = (18 Ã— 43) / (4 Ã— 43) = 207/172

Step 2: Find the fraction of the bottle that 207/172 represents.
207/172 = (207/172) / (22/43) = (207 Ã— 43) / (172 Ã— 22) = 9/4

Step 3: Calculate the amount of juice you drink by multiplying the fraction of the bottle by the total amount of juice in the bottle.
Amount of juice you drink = (9/4) Ã— (22/43) liters
Amount of juice you drink = (9 Ã— 22) / (4 Ã— 43) liters
Amount of juice you drink = 198/172 liters
Amount of juice you drink â‰ˆ 1.15 liters

Therefore, you drink approximately 1.15 liters of juice.

Given information:
- The initial speed of the sports car is 40 miles per hour.
- The additional speed gained due to the wind is 26/24 miles per hour.

Step 1: Convert the fraction 26/24 to a decimal.
26/24 = 1.0833 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the total speed after one hour by adding the initial speed and the additional speed gained due to the wind.
Total speed after one hour = Initial speed + Additional speed gained due to the wind
Total speed after one hour = 40 miles per hour + 1.0833 miles per hour
Total speed after one hour = 41.0833 miles per hour

Given information:
- James initially had 33/37 gallons of milk in the jug.
- James added 3/25 gallons of milk to the jug.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of 37 and 25.
LCD = 37 Ã— 25 = 925

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
33/37 = (33 Ã— 25)/925 = 825/925
3/25 = (3 Ã— 37)/925 = 111/925

Step 3: Add the fractions.
(825/925) + (111/925) = 936/925

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
936/925 = 1 (remaining 11/925)

Given information:
- James has 30 similar jugs of milk.
- Each jug has the same combined volume of 1 11/925 gallons.

To find the total amount of milk in gallons for all 30 jugs, we need to multiply the combined volume of one jug by the number of jugs.

Step 1: Convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction.
1 11/925 = (1 Ã— 925 + 11) / 925 = 936 / 925

Step 2: Multiply the improper fraction by the number of jugs.
(936 / 925) Ã— 30 = 28080 / 925

Step 3: Simplify the fraction if possible.
28080 / 925 = 30 12/925

Therefore, the total amount of milk in gallons for all 30 jugs is 30 12/925 gallons.

- The first segment of the journey took 43/29 hours.
- The break lasted 31/4 hours.

Step 1: Convert the fractions into decimal form.
43/29 = 1.482758620689655 hours (for the first segment of the journey)
31/4 = 7.75 hours (for the break)

Step 2: Find the total time spent on the journey and the break.
Total time = Time spent on the first segment of the journey + Time spent on the break
Total time = 1.482758620689655 hours + 7.75 hours
Total time = 9.232758620689655 hours

Therefore, the total time spent on the first segment of the journey and the break is 9.232758620689655 hours.

Given information:
- The turtle's speed is 19/6 feet per second.
- The turtle starts 20 feet ahead from the starting point.
- We need to find the total distance traveled in 24 seconds.

Step 1: Convert the turtle's speed from a fraction to a decimal.
19/6 feet per second = 3.17 feet per second

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in 24 seconds.
Distance traveled = Speed Ã— Time
Distance traveled = 3.17 feet per second Ã— 24 seconds
Distance traveled = 76.08 feet

Step 3: Add the initial distance of 20 feet to the distance traveled.
Total distance = Initial distance + Distance traveled
Total distance = 20 feet + 76.08 feet
Total distance = 96.08 feet

Therefore, the turtle would travel a total distance of 96.08 feet in 24 seconds, starting 20 feet ahead from the starting point.

Given information:
- The container's capacity is 3 liters.
- Carlos filled the container with orange juice to 41/49 of its capacity.

Step 1: Find the fraction of the container's capacity that Carlos filled with orange juice.
Fraction of the container's capacity filled = 41/49

Step 2: Multiply the fraction by the total capacity of the container to find the amount of orange juice poured into the container.
Amount of orange juice poured = (41/49) Ã— 3 liters
Amount of orange juice poured = (41 Ã— 3) / 49 liters
Amount of orange juice poured = 123 / 49 liters
