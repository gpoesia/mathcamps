Given information:
- The school bus drives a total of 2496 miles over 52 weeks.

Step 1: Find the total number of miles driven per week.
Total miles driven / Total number of weeks = Average miles driven per week
2496 miles / 52 weeks = 48 miles per week

Therefore, the bus drives an average of 48 miles each week.

Step 1: Find the average number of miles driven per week.
Total miles driven / Total number of weeks = Average miles driven per week
6100 miles / 52 weeks = 117.31 miles per week

Given information:
- The astronaut has a 90-day mission in space.
- The total oxygen consumption during the mission is 3870 liters.
- The oxygen consumption is the same every day.

Step 1: Find the daily oxygen consumption.
Daily oxygen consumption = Total oxygen consumption / Number of days

Given information:
- The astronaut's mission got extended to 124 days.
- The total oxygen consumption during the extended mission is still 3870 liters.

Step 1: Find the daily oxygen consumption for the extended mission.
Daily oxygen consumption = Total oxygen consumption / Number of days
Daily oxygen consumption = 3870 liters / 124 days
Daily oxygen consumption = 31.21 liters (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, if the astronaut's mission got extended to 124 days, and he still used a total of 3870 liters of oxygen, he used approximately 31.21 liters of oxygen daily.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of mice caught by the number of months.

Given information:
- The cat caught 2187 mice.
- The period was 27 months.

Step 1: Divide the total number of mice caught by the number of months.
Number of mice caught per month = Total number of mice caught / Number of months
Number of mice caught per month = 2187 / 27
Number of mice caught per month = 81

Therefore, the cat catches 81 mice each month on average.

Given information:
- There are 2925 toy trucks in the new stash.
- There are 18 stuffed animals.

To find the number of additional toy trucks each stuffed animal will get, we need to divide the total number of toy trucks in the new stash by the number of stuffed animals.

Number of additional toy trucks per stuffed animal = Total number of toy trucks in the new stash / Number of stuffed animals
Number of additional toy trucks per stuffed animal = 2925 / 18
Number of additional toy trucks per stuffed animal = 162.5

Since we cannot have a fractional number of toy trucks, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Length of the river within each city = 3767 kilometers / 82 cities
Length of the river within each city = 45.94 kilometers (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, if the river's length of 3767 kilometers is evenly distributed among the 82 cities, there would be 45.94 kilometers of the river's length within each city.

Given information:
- The tiger walked a total of 2556 meters.

36 minutes = 36 / 60 hours = 0.6 hours

Step 2: Find the rate at which the tiger walked by dividing the total distance by the time taken.
Rate = Total distance / Time taken
Rate = 2556 meters / 0.6 hours

Step 1: Convert the time from minutes to hours.
36 minutes = 36 / 60 hours = 0.6 hours

Step 2: Find the rate at which the tiger walked by dividing the total distance by the time taken.
Rate = Total distance / Time taken
Rate = 2301 meters / 0.6 hours
Rate = 3835 meters per hour

Step 3: Convert the rate from meters per hour to meters per minute.
Rate in meters per minute = Rate in meters per hour / 60 minutes

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of minutes the kite is flown per day with the new total flight time of 9051 minutes over 23 days.

Given information:
- The kite is flown for a total of 9051 minutes over the course of 23 days.
- The kite is flown for the same amount of time each day.

Step 1: Find the total number of minutes the kite is flown per day.
Total minutes flown / Number of days = Minutes flown per day
9051 minutes / 23 days = 393.5 minutes per day

Therefore, with a total flight time of 9051 minutes over 23 days, the kite is in the air for 393.5 minutes (or approximately 6 hours and 34 minutes) per day.

Given information:
- The mouse can travel a total distance of 4928 meters.
- The mouse runs for 3690 minutes.

Step 1: Convert the time from minutes to hours.
3690 minutes = 3690 / 60 hours
3690 minutes = 61.5 hours

Step 2: Find the average distance the mouse runs in one hour.
Average distance per hour = Total distance / Total hours
Average distance per hour = 4928 meters / 61.5 hours
Average distance per hour = 80 meters

Step 3: Find the average distance the mouse runs in one minute.
Average distance per minute = Average distance per hour / 60 minutes

Step 1: Find the total number of friends among whom the gifts will be distributed.
Total number of friends = 50

Step 2: Divide the total number of gifts by the total number of friends to find the number of gifts each friend will receive.
Number of gifts each friend will receive = Total number of gifts / Total number of friends
Number of gifts each friend will receive = 4030 / 50
Number of gifts each friend will receive = 80.6

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the UFO in miles per minute when it traveled a distance of 1278 miles in 218 minutes.

Given information:
- The UFO traveled a distance of 1278 miles.
- The UFO traveled for 218 minutes.

Step 1: Find the speed of the UFO in miles per minute.
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1278 miles / 218 minutes
Speed = 5.86 miles per minute (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, if the UFO traveled the same distance of 1278 miles but over a longer period of 218 minutes, its speed would be 5.86 miles per minute.

Given information:
- The improved bubble machine produces a total of 6080 bubbles over a period of 24 minutes.

Step 1: Find the number of bubbles produced per minute by the improved bubble machine.
Number of bubbles produced per minute = Total number of bubbles produced / Total number of minutes
Number of bubbles produced per minute = 6080 bubbles / 24 minutes
Number of bubbles produced per minute = 253.33 bubbles per minute

Therefore, the improved bubble machine produces 253.33 bubbles in a minute, which can be rounded to 253 bubbles per minute.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of tulips in each row by dividing the total number of tulips by the number of rows.

Given information:
- Annapurna plans to plant 3520 tulips.
- She wants to plant them in 40 equal rows.

Step 1: Divide the total number of tulips by the number of rows.
Number of tulips in each row = Total number of tulips / Number of rows
Number of tulips in each row = 3520 / 40
Number of tulips in each row = 88

Therefore, Annapurna will plant 88 tulips in each row.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of tulips that Anna will plant in each space by dividing the total number of tulips by the number of spaces available.

Given information:
- Anna has 3520 tulips.
- She has 3052 spaces to plant the tulips.
- She wants to split the tulips evenly among the spaces.

Step 1: Divide the total number of tulips by the number of spaces.
Number of tulips in each space = Total number of tulips / Number of spaces
Number of tulips in each space = 3520 / 3052
Number of tulips in each space = 1.1536 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Since we cannot have a fractional number of tulips, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Anna will plant 1 tulip in each space.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many ice skates each store will receive if the total number of ice skates is distributed equally among all the stores, considering the additional shipment.

Given information:
- The sporting goods store received an additional shipment, bringing the total number of new ice skates to 3887.
- The store has 38 locations.

Step 1: Find the number of ice skates each store will receive.
Total number of ice skates / Number of store locations = Number of ice skates per store
3887 ice skates / 38 store locations = 102.29 ice skates per store

Since we cannot have a fractional number of ice skates, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, each store will receive 102 ice skates.

Given information:
- The novel has 4606 pages.
- You want to split the reading evenly over 47 days.

Step 1: Divide the total number of pages by the number of days.
Number of pages to read each day = Total number of pages / Number of days
Number of pages to read each day = 4606 pages / 47 days
Number of pages to read each day = 98 pages

Therefore, to split the reading of the 4606-page novel evenly over 47 days, you need to read 98 pages each day.

Given information:
- The new novel has 5982 pages.
- You want to split the reading evenly over the same 47 days.

Step 1: Divide the new total number of pages by the number of days.
New number of pages to read each day = New total number of pages / Number of days
New number of pages to read each day = 5982 pages / 47 days
New number of pages to read each day = 127.28 pages (rounded down to 127 pages)

Given information:
- The dressmaking company has 3234 centimeters of fabric.
- Each skirt requires 33 centimeters of fabric.

Step 1: Divide the total fabric length by the fabric required for one skirt.
Total fabric length / Fabric required for one skirt = Number of skirts that can be made
3234 centimeters / 33 centimeters = 97.97 skirts

Step 2: Since we cannot have a fractional part of a skirt, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.
97.97 skirts rounded down to the nearest whole number = 97 skirts

Therefore, the dressmaking company can make a total of 97 skirts with the available 3234 centimeters of fabric.

Step 1: Find the total number of minutes the doctor spends talking with patients each day.
Total minutes spent talking with patients / Total number of days = Minutes spent talking with patients each day

To find the number of minutes the doctor spends talking with patients each day, we need to divide the total minutes by the number of days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of minutes the doctor spends talking with patients each day.
Total minutes spent talking with patients / Total number of days = Minutes spent talking with patients each day
1047 minutes / 56 days = 18.7 minutes per day

Therefore, the doctor actually spends approximately 18.7 minutes (or about 19 minutes) each day talking with patients.

Given information:
- Sam has a total of 3025 marshmallows.
- Each bag should contain 55 marshmallows.

Step 1: Divide the total number of marshmallows by the number of marshmallows in each bag.
Number of bags = Total marshmallows / Marshmallows per bag
Number of bags = 3025 / 55
Number of bags = 55

Step 2: Since we cannot have a fractional number of bags, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.
Number of bags = 55

Step 3: Calculate the total number of marshmallows in all the bags.
Total marshmallows in bags = Number of bags Ã— Marshmallows per bag
Total marshmallows in bags = 55 Ã— 55
Total marshmallows in bags = 3025

Therefore, all the marshmallows will be packaged into 55 bags, with each bag containing 55 marshmallows.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times 80 inches can be divided into the total length of wood available, which is also 80 inches.

Given information:
- The carpenter has 80 inches of wood.
- Each door requires exactly 80 inches of wood.

Step 1: Divide the total length of wood by the length required for one door.
Number of doors = Total length of wood / Length required for one door
Number of doors = 80 inches / 80 inches
Number of doors = 1

Therefore, the carpenter can make 1 door with the available 80 inches of wood.

Given information:
- The carpenter has 4322 inches of wood.

Step 1: Divide the total length of wood by the length required for one door.
Number of doors = Total length of wood / Length required for one door
Number of doors = 4322 inches / 80 inches
Number of doors = 54.025

Since we cannot have a fractional number of doors, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Step 2: Round down the result to the nearest whole number.
Number of doors = 54 (rounded down from 54.025)

Therefore, the carpenter can make 54 doors with the available 4322 inches of wood.

Given information:
- The doctor treated a total of 2691 patients.
- The doctor's active service period was 39 years.

Step 1: Find the average number of patients treated per year.
Average number of patients treated per year = Total number of patients treated / Number of years of active service
Average number of patients treated per year = 2691 patients / 39 years

Step 1: Find the average number of patients treated per year.
Average number of patients treated per year = Total number of patients treated / Number of years of active service
Average number of patients treated per year = 9447 patients / 39 years
Average number of patients treated per year = 242 patients

Given information:
- The farmer harvested 8539 cucumbers in total in the next season.
- The farmer had 52 plants.
- The farmer harvested the same number of cucumbers from each plant as in the previous season.

Since the farmer harvested the same number of cucumbers from each plant as in the previous season, we can use the result from the previous problem, which was 18 cucumbers per plant.

Therefore, in the next season, the farmer got 18 cucumbers from each plant as well.

To verify this, we can multiply the number of plants (52) by the number of cucumbers per plant (18):
52 plants Ã— 18 cucumbers per plant = 936 cucumbers

This matches the total number of cucumbers harvested in the previous season (936).

Given information:
- The clock ticks 756 times in 18 minutes.

Step 1: Find the number of ticks per minute.
Number of ticks per minute = Total number of ticks / Total number of minutes
Number of ticks per minute = 756 ticks / 18 minutes
Number of ticks per minute = 42 ticks per minute

Therefore, the clock ticks 42 times in one minute.

Given information:
- The clock ticks 3788 times in 18 minutes.

Step 1: Find the number of ticks per minute.
Number of ticks per minute = Total number of ticks / Total number of minutes
Number of ticks per minute = 3788 ticks / 18 minutes
Number of ticks per minute = 210.44 ticks per minute

Since we cannot have a fractional number of ticks, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of kilometers to centimeters on the map.

Given information:
- 8448 kilometers are represented as 96 centimeters on the map.

Step 1: Find the ratio of kilometers to centimeters.
Ratio of kilometers to centimeters = 8448 kilometers / 96 centimeters
Ratio of kilometers to centimeters = 88 kilometers / 1 centimeter

Step 2: Convert the ratio to find how many kilometers each centimeter represents.
1 centimeter represents 88 kilometers

Therefore, each centimeter on the map represents 88 kilometers.

Given information:
- The teacher assigns a total of 3612 pages of reading.
- The reading is assigned over 86 days of school.

Step 1: Divide the total number of pages by the number of days.
Number of pages per day = Total number of pages / Number of days

* Originally, the total number of pages was 3612
* Originally, the number of days was 86
* Now, the total number of pages is still 3612
* But the number of days has changed to 328

To find the new number of pages per day, we divide the total pages by the new number of days:

Total pages = 3612
New number of days = 328

Pages per day = Total pages / New number of days
            = 3612 / 328
            = 11

Therefore, with the reduced reading load spread over 328 days, each student would need to read 11 pages daily.

Given:
- Total number of hats produced in the following year = 7678
- Total number of weeks = 57
- The hat maker maintains the same pace of production every week as the previous year.

To find the number of hats produced weekly, we need to divide the total number of hats produced by the total number of weeks.

Number of hats produced weekly = Total number of hats produced / Total number of weeks
Number of hats produced weekly = 7678 / 57

Calculating the result:

Step 1: Find the total number of socks produced.
Total number of socks produced = 4218 pairs of socks Ã— 2 socks per pair
Total number of socks produced = 4218 Ã— 2 = 8436 socks

Step 2: Find the daily production of socks.

Daily production of socks = 8436 socks / 74 days
Daily production of socks = 114 socks

Step 3: Convert the daily production of socks to pairs of socks.
Daily production of pairs of socks = Daily production of socks / 2 socks per pair
Daily production of pairs of socks = 114 socks / 2
Daily production of pairs of socks = 57 pairs of socks

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of toys made per day by dividing the total number of toys made in a week by the number of days the factory operates.

Given information:
- The toy factory makes 364 toys in a week.
- The factory operates for 4 days a week.

Step 1: Find the number of toys made per day.
Number of toys made per day = Total number of toys made in a week / Number of days the factory operates
Number of toys made per day = 364 toys / 4 days
Number of toys made per day = 91 toys

Therefore, the toy factory makes 91 toys per day.

Given information:
- The toy factory now makes 571 toys in a week.

Step 1: Find the number of toys made per day with the new production rate.
Number of toys made per day = New total number of toys made in a week / Number of days the factory operates
Number of toys made per day = 571 toys / 4 days
Number of toys made per day = 142.75 toys

Therefore, with the new production rate, the toy factory now makes 142.75 toys per day.

Given information:
- The dragon has 3453 gold coins in total.
- The gold coins are spread evenly among 66 small chests.

Step 1: Divide the total number of gold coins by the number of chests.
Number of gold coins in each chest = Total number of gold coins / Number of chests
Number of gold coins in each chest = 3453 / 66
Number of gold coins in each chest = 52.32727272727273

Since we cannot have a fractional number of gold coins in each chest, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of gold coins in each chest = 52

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the new information.

Given information:
- The treasure chest contains 5857 gold coins.
- The gold coins are evenly distributed in 91 bags.

Step 1: Divide the total number of gold coins by the number of bags.
Number of gold coins in each bag = Total number of gold coins / Number of bags
Number of gold coins in each bag = 5857 / 91

Step 2: Calculate the result.
Number of gold coins in each bag = 5857 / 91
Number of gold coins in each bag = 64.36...

Since we cannot have a fractional number of gold coins in each bag, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of gold coins in each bag = 64

Therefore, with 5857 gold coins distributed evenly among 91 bags, each bag would hold 64 gold coins.

Given information:
- The mountain's height is 8729 meters.

To find the height of each layer, we need to divide the total height of the mountain by the number of layers.

Step 1: Divide the total height of the mountain by the number of layers.
Height of each layer = Total height of the mountain / Number of layers
Height of each layer = 8729 meters / 47 layers

Step 2: Calculate the height of each layer.
Height of each layer = 8729 meters / 47 layers

            Let's consider that our dragon, instead of collecting 3010 jewels over 43 years, increased his hoard to 6402 jewels over the same period. If the dragon collected at an even pace throughout these years, how many jewels did he collect each year now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of jewels the dragon collected each year by dividing the new total number of jewels by the number of years.

Given information:
- The dragon collected a hoard of 6402 jewels.
- The dragon collected the jewels over a period of 43 years.

Step 1: Divide the new total number of jewels by the number of years.
Number of jewels collected each year = Total number of jewels / Number of years
Number of jewels collected each year = 6402 / 43

Step 2: Calculate the result.
Number of jewels collected each year = 6402 / 43
Number of jewels collected each year = 148.88888888888889

Since we cannot have a fractional number of jewels, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of jewels collected each year = 148

Therefore, if the dragon collected 6402 jewels evenly throughout the 43 years, he collected 148 jewels each year.

Given information:
- The alien spaceship sends out a pattern of 6699 signals over the course of 87 Earth days.
- The spaceship sends the same number of signals each day.

To find the number of signals sent daily, we need to divide the total number of signals (6699) by the number of days (87).

Number of signals sent daily = Total number of signals / Number of days
Number of signals sent daily = 6699 / 87
Number of signals sent daily = 77

Therefore, the alien spaceship sends 77 signals daily.

Given information:
- The alien spaceship sends out a pattern of 6699 signals.
- The pattern is sent over the course of 2715 Earth days.
- The spaceship sends the same number of signals each day.

To find the number of signals sent daily, we need to divide the total number of signals (6699) by the number of days (2715).

Number of signals sent daily = Total number of signals / Number of days
Number of signals sent daily = 6699 / 2715
Number of signals sent daily = 2.47 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, if the alien spaceship sends out the same pattern of 6699 signals over the course of 2715 Earth days, it sends approximately 2.47 signals daily.

Given information:
- The water tank contains 2016 liters of water.
- The tank is designed to provide enough water for 28 days without replenishment.

To find the amount of water the tank provides per day, we need to divide the total amount of water in the tank by the number of days it is designed to last.

Total amount of water in the tank = 2016 liters
Number of days the tank is designed to last = 28 days

Amount of water provided per day = Total amount of water in the tank / Number of days

Now, we are told that the tank is filled with 8329 liters of water instead of 2016 liters, but the duration of usage (28 days) remains the same.

To find the amount of water the tank would provide per day with 8329 liters, we need to divide the total amount of water in the tank by the number of days it is designed to last.

Total amount of water in the tank = 8329 liters
Number of days the tank is designed to last = 28 days

Amount of water provided per day = Total amount of water in the tank / Number of days
Amount of water provided per day = 8329 liters / 28 days
Amount of water provided per day = 297.46 liters (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, if the water tank is filled with 8329 liters of water and the duration of usage remains 28 days, the tank would provide 297.46 liters of water per day.

To find the number of gifts each shelter will receive, we need to divide the total number of gifts by the number of shelters.

Step 1: Divide the total number of gifts by the number of shelters.
Number of gifts per shelter = Total number of gifts / Number of shelters
Number of gifts per shelter = 3697 / 13
Number of gifts per shelter = 284.38461538461536

Since we cannot have a fractional number of gifts, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of each smaller snowball by dividing the total volume of the giant snowball by the number of smaller snowballs.

Given information:
- The volume of the giant snowball is 528 cubic feet.
- The child makes 16 smaller snowballs using the same amount of snow.

Step 1: Find the total volume of snow used for the smaller snowballs.
Total volume of snow used for smaller snowballs = Volume of the giant snowball
Total volume of snow used for smaller snowballs = 528 cubic feet

Step 2: Find the volume of each smaller snowball by dividing the total volume by the number of smaller snowballs.
Volume of each smaller snowball = Total volume of snow used for smaller snowballs / Number of smaller snowballs
Volume of each smaller snowball = 528 cubic feet / 16
Volume of each smaller snowball = 33 cubic feet

Therefore, the volume of each smaller snowball is 33 cubic feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of each smaller snowball by dividing the total volume of the new giant snowball by the number of smaller snowballs.

Given information:
- The total volume of the new giant snowball is 3327 cubic feet.
- The child makes 16 smaller snowballs using the same amount of snow.

Step 1: Find the total volume of snow used for the smaller snowballs.
Total volume of snow used for smaller snowballs = Volume of the new giant snowball
Total volume of snow used for smaller snowballs = 3327 cubic feet

Step 2: Find the volume of each smaller snowball by dividing the total volume by the number of smaller snowballs.
Volume of each smaller snowball = Total volume of snow used for smaller snowballs / Number of smaller snowballs
Volume of each smaller snowball = 3327 cubic feet / 16
Volume of each smaller snowball = 207.9375 cubic feet

Therefore, the volume of each smaller snowball is 207.9375 cubic feet.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            A slide is 728 inches long and has evenly spaced waves every 56 inches. How many waves are there on the slide?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times the wave pattern repeats on the slide.

Given information:
- The slide is 728 inches long.
- The waves are evenly spaced every 56 inches.

Step 1: Find the number of times the wave pattern repeats on the slide.
Number of times the wave pattern repeats = Total length of the slide / Distance between waves
Number of times the wave pattern repeats = 728 inches / 56 inches
Number of times the wave pattern repeats = 13

Step 2: Since the waves are evenly spaced, the number of waves on the slide is one more than the number of times the wave pattern repeats.
Number of waves on the slide = Number of times the wave pattern repeats + 1
Number of waves on the slide = 13 + 1
Number of waves on the slide = 14

Therefore, there are 14 waves on the slide.
