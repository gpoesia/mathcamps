        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the amount of money Liam had initially and the amount he spent on the video game.

Given information:
- Liam had $90 in twenties, tens, and fives.
- Liam spent $81 on a new video game.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Liam had initially.
Amount of money Liam had initially = $90

Step 2: Find the amount of money Liam spent on the video game.
Amount of money spent on the video game = $81

Step 3: Find the amount of money Liam has left by subtracting the amount spent from the initial amount.
Amount of money left = Initial amount - Amount spent
Amount of money left = $90 - $81
Amount of money left = $9

Therefore, Liam has $9 left after buying the video game.

Given information:
- Liam had $99 in twenties, tens, and fives.
- Liam spent $81 on a new video game.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Liam had initially.
Amount of money Liam had initially = $99

Step 2: Find the amount of money Liam spent on the video game.
Amount of money spent on the video game = $81

Step 3: Find the amount of money Liam has left by subtracting the amount spent from the initial amount.
Amount of money left = Initial amount - Amount spent
Amount of money left = $99 - $81

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many nickels Maria had initially and then subtract the value of the bubblegum from it.

Given information:
- Maria has 37 cents in nickels.
- Maria spent 12 cents on bubblegum.

Step 1: Find the number of nickels Maria had initially.
1 nickel = 5 cents
Number of nickels = Total value of nickels / Value of one nickel
Number of nickels = 37 cents / 5 cents per nickel
Number of nickels = 7 nickels (with 2 cents remaining)

Step 2: Subtract the value of the bubblegum from the initial value of nickels.
Initial value of nickels = 37 cents
Value of bubblegum = 12 cents
Amount left = Initial value of nickels - Value of bubblegum
Amount left = 37 cents - 12 cents
Amount left = 25 cents

Therefore, after spending 12 cents on bubblegum, Maria has 25 cents left.

Given information:
- Maria had 37 cents in nickels initially.
- Maria spent 12 cents on bubblegum.
- Maria decided to save the remaining amount.
- Maria will save the same amount next week.

Step 1: Find the amount Maria had left after spending 12 cents on bubblegum.
Initial amount = 37 cents
Amount spent on bubblegum = 12 cents
Amount left = Initial amount - Amount spent on bubblegum
Amount left = 37 cents - 12 cents
Amount left = 25 cents

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Maria will have after saving the same amount next week.
Total amount = Amount left + Amount saved next week
Total amount = 25 cents + 25 cents
Total amount = 50 cents

Therefore, if Maria saves the same amount next week as she had left after spending 12 cents on bubblegum, she will have a total of 50 cents.

Initial value of nickels = 37 cents

Step 1: Find the total amount of money Mario spent.
Amount spent on the snack + Cost of the video game = Total amount spent
$3 + $72 = $75

Step 2: Find the amount of money Mario has left.

Step 1: Add the money Marie had initially and the money she received as a gift.
Money Marie had initially + Money received as a gift = Total money after receiving the gift
$19 + $32 = $51

Step 2: Add the money Marie earned from mowing the lawn to the total money after receiving the gift.
Total money after receiving the gift + Money earned from mowing the lawn = Total money Marie has now
$51 + $14 = $65

Therefore, Marie now has a total of $65.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this problem, we need to find out how much money Marie has left after paying back her friend $32.

Given information:
- Marie had $19 saved from her allowance.
- Marie received $32 from her grandma as a birthday gift.
- Marie earned $14 from mowing a neighbor's lawn.
- Marie needs to pay back her friend $32 that she borrowed last week.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Marie had before paying back her friend.
Money from allowance + Money received as a gift + Money earned from mowing the lawn = Total money before paying back
$19 + $32 + $14 = $65

Step 2: Subtract the amount Marie needs to pay back from the total money she had.
Total money before paying back - Amount to pay back = Money left after paying back
$65 - $32 = $33

Therefore, after paying back her friend $32, Marie has $33 left.

            Here is the follow-up question based on the previous problem:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to update the amount of money Marie received as a gift from her grandma and then recalculate the total amount of money she has.

Given information:
- Marie had $19 saved from her allowance.
- Marie received $13 from her grandma as a birthday gift (instead of $32).
- Marie earned $14 from mowing a neighbor's lawn.

Step 1: Add the money Marie had initially and the money she received as a gift.
Money Marie had initially + Money received as a gift = Total money after receiving the gift
$19 + $13 = $32

Step 2: Add the money Marie earned from mowing the lawn to the total money after receiving the gift.
Total money after receiving the gift + Money earned from mowing the lawn = Total money Marie has now
$32 + $14 = $46

Therefore, after the changes, Marie now has a total of $46.

* Initially, Luke found $1 in his pocket
* Luke's dad gave him $27

To find the total amount of money Luke has before buying the toy car, we need to add the two amounts together.

Given:
- Amount Luke found in his pocket = $1
- Amount Luke's dad gave him = $27

Total amount of money Luke has = Amount found in pocket + Amount given by dad
Total amount of money Luke has = $1 + $27
Total amount of money Luke has = $28

Therefore, before buying the toy car, Luke would have $28.

- He found $3 under his bed and added it to his piggy bank, making it $64.
- He won $30 from a school contest.

To find the total amount of money Marcos will have in his piggy bank after adding the $30 from the contest, we need to add it to the current amount in his piggy bank.

Step 1: Calculate the current amount in Marcos' piggy bank.
Current amount in piggy bank = $61 + $3 = $64

Step 2: Add the amount won from the school contest to the current amount in the piggy bank.
Total amount in piggy bank = Current amount in piggy bank + Amount won from contest
Total amount in piggy bank = $64 + $30 = $94

Therefore, after adding the $30 he won from the school contest to his piggy bank, Marcos will have a total of $94 in his piggy bank.

Given information:
- Julia had 75 quarters initially.

Given:
- Ellie originally thought she had 74 quarters in her piggy bank.
- However, she made a mistake in counting, and she actually had 9 quarters less than she thought.

To find the correct number of quarters in her piggy bank, we need to subtract 9 from the original count of 74 quarters.

Step 1: Subtract the number of quarters she miscounted from the original count.
Correct number of quarters = Original count - Number of quarters miscounted
Correct number of quarters = 74 - 9
Correct number of quarters = 65

Given information:
- Ryan initially had 51 quarters in his piggy bank.
- Ryan uses 3 quarters to buy a pencil.

Step 1: Find the number of quarters Ryan has left after his purchase.
Number of quarters left = Initial number of quarters - Number of quarters used
Number of quarters left = 51 - 3

- Debbie finds 31 pennies on the street.
- Later that day, she finds 27 more pennies.

Step 1: Find the total number of pennies Debbie has.
Total number of pennies = Number of pennies found initially + Number of pennies found later
Total number of pennies = 31 + 27
Total number of pennies = 58

Therefore, Debbie has a total of 58 pennies.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Eddie has after receiving the initial $6 from his aunt.

            Mike goes to the toy store with $99. He buys a toy lego set for $30. How much money will Mike have left if he uses his $99 to pay for the lego set?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to subtract the cost of the Lego set from the amount of money Mike has.

Given information:
- Mike has $99.
- The Lego set costs $30.

Step 1: Subtract the cost of the Lego set from the amount of money Mike has.
Amount of money left = Amount of money Mike has - Cost of the Lego set
Amount of money left = $99 - $30
Amount of money left = $69

Therefore, Mike will have $69 left after buying the Lego set with his $99.

            After buying the lego set, Mike sees a pack of marbles that costs $1. If he buys the marbles after purchasing the lego set, how much money from his original $99 would he have left then?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* Mike originally had $99
* He spent $30 on the Lego set
* After buying the Lego set, he had $99 - $30 = $69 left
* He wants to buy a pack of marbles that costs $1

To find out how much money he would have left after buying the marbles, we need to subtract the cost of the marbles from the amount he had left after buying the Lego set.

Amount left after buying Lego set: $69
Cost of marbles: $1

Amount left after buying marbles = Amount left after buying Lego set - Cost of marbles
                                 = $69 - $1
                                 = $68

Therefore, if Mike buys the pack of marbles after purchasing the Lego set, he would have $68 left from his original $99.

Number of quarters left = Initial number of quarters - Number of quarters used to buy the toy
Number of quarters left = 37 - 22
Number of quarters left = 15

Step 2: Find the number of quarters Emily will have if she doubles the amount of quarters left.
Number of quarters after doubling = Number of quarters left Ã— 2
Number of quarters after doubling = 15 Ã— 2
Number of quarters after doubling = 30

Therefore, Emily will have 15 quarters left in her piggy bank after buying the toy, and if she doubles the amount of quarters left, she will have 30 quarters.

Given information:
- Emily had 31 quarters in her piggy bank initially.
- Emily used 22 quarters to buy a toy.

To find the number of quarters left in her piggy bank after buying the toy, we need to subtract the number of quarters used from the initial number of quarters.

Step 1: Find the number of quarters left after buying the toy.
Number of quarters left = Initial number of quarters - Number of quarters used to buy the toy
Number of quarters left = 31 - 22

Number of quarters Jerry has - Cost of the toy car = Number of quarters left
39 quarters - 9 quarters = 30 quarters

Therefore, Jerry will have 30 quarters left after buying the toy car.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given:
- Jerry initially had 39 quarters.
- He bought a toy car that cost 9 quarters.
- After buying the toy car, he had 30 quarters left (39 - 9 = 30).
- He wants to buy a toy airplane that costs 26 quarters.

To find how many quarters Jerry will have left after buying the toy airplane, we need to subtract the cost of the toy airplane from the number of quarters he had left after buying the toy car.

Step 1: Find the number of quarters Jerry had left after buying the toy car.
Number of quarters left after buying the toy car = 30 quarters

Step 2: Find the cost of the toy airplane in quarters.
Cost of the toy airplane = 26 quarters

Step 3: Find the number of quarters Jerry will have left after buying the toy airplane.
Number of quarters left after buying the toy car - Cost of the toy airplane = Number of quarters left after buying both toys
30 quarters - 26 quarters = 4 quarters

Therefore, after buying the toy car and the toy airplane, Jerry will have 4 quarters left.

Cost of the toy car = 9 quarters

Step 2: Find the number of quarters Jerry will have left after buying the toy car.
Number of quarters Jerry initially had - Cost of the toy car = Number of quarters left

To find the total amount he will have saved, we need to add the amount he saved this month to the amount he will save next month.

Amount saved this month = $36
Amount to be saved next month = $36 (same as this month)

Total amount saved = Amount saved this month + Amount to be saved next month
Total amount saved = $36 + $36
Total amount saved = $72

Given information:
- Amy has 74 pennies in her piggy bank.
- Amy takes out 7 pennies to buy a gumball.

Step 1: Find the number of pennies Amy has left in her piggy bank.
Number of pennies left = Initial number of pennies - Number of pennies taken out
Number of pennies left = 74 - 7
Number of pennies left = 67

Given information:
- John saved $76 from his part-time job.
- John's uncle gave him $21 as a birthday gift.
- John wants to buy a video game that costs $26.

Step 1: Find the total amount of money John had initially.
John's savings + Uncle's gift = Total amount of money
$76 + $21 = $97

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the video game from the total amount of money.
Total amount of money - Cost of the video game = Amount of money left
$97 - $26 = $71

Therefore, John has $71 left after purchasing the video game.

- Alex originally had 21 dollar bills.
- He used 4 dollar bills to buy the toy robot.

To find the number of dollar bills left after the purchase, we need to subtract the number of dollar bills used from the initial number of dollar bills.

Given information:
- Initial number of dollar bills = 21
- Number of dollar bills used to buy the toy robot = 4

Step 1: Find the number of dollar bills left after the purchase.
Number of dollar bills left = Initial number of dollar bills - Number of dollar bills used
Number of dollar bills left = 21 - 4
Number of dollar bills left = 17

Given information:
- Lucy had $64.
- John had $33 left after buying the video game.

Step 1: Find the difference between Lucy's money and John's remaining money.
Difference in money = Lucy's money - John's remaining money
Difference in money = $64 - $33
Difference in money = $31

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given information:
- John initially had $82 in his wallet.
- John spent $26 on a new video game.

To find the amount of money John has left after buying the video game, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had.

Step 1: Subtract the amount spent on the video game from the initial amount of money in John's wallet.
Amount of money left = Initial amount of money - Amount spent on the video game
Amount of money left = $82 - $26
Amount of money left = $56

Therefore, after buying the video game for $26, John has $56 left in his wallet.

Given:
- Alex initially had $22.
- Alex's father gave him an additional $33.
- After receiving money from his mother, Alex had a total of $84.

To calculate the amount of money Alex's mother gave him, we need to subtract the total amount he had before receiving money from his mother from the final total amount.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Alex had before receiving money from his mother.
Initial amount + Amount received from father = Total amount before receiving money from mother
$22 + $33 = $55

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Alex's mother gave him.
Final total amount - Total amount before receiving money from mother = Amount received from mother
$84 - $55 = $29

- George found a jar containing 72 pennies.
- George spent 25 pennies at the candy store.

Step 1: Find the total number of pennies George had before going to the candy store.
Total pennies before going to the candy store = Pennies in his pocket + Pennies in the jar
Total pennies before going to the candy store = 27 + 72
Total pennies before going to the candy store = 99

Step 2: Subtract the number of pennies George spent at the candy store from the total pennies he had before going.
Pennies left after going to the candy store = Total pennies before going to the candy store - Pennies spent at the candy store
Pennies left after going to the candy store = 99 - 25

Step 1: Find the total amount of money Amy earned from selling candles.
Total candles sold = 58 + 27 = 85 candles
Total money earned from selling candles = 85 Ã— $1 = $85

Step 2: Subtract the cost of parking from the total money earned.
Total money earned after paying for parking = Total money earned from selling candles - Cost of parking

Total candles sold = 1 + 27 = 28 candles
Total money earned from selling candles = 28 Ã— $1 = $28

Number of quarters left = 15 quarters

Therefore, after realizing her initial count was incorrect, Rita has 15 quarters left after her purchase.

To find the number of quarters Sara has left before her brother gave her any quarters, we need to subtract the number of quarters she used for the school project from the initial number of quarters she had.

Step 1: Find the number of quarters Sara has left before her brother gave her any quarters.
Number of quarters left = Initial number of quarters - Number of quarters used for the school project
Number of quarters left = 58 - 48

To find the number of quarters Marco has left, we need to subtract the number of quarters he used to buy the toy car from the initial number of quarters he had.

Step 1: Find the number of quarters Marco has left after buying the toy car.
Number of quarters left = Initial number of quarters - Number of quarters used to buy the toy car
Number of quarters left = 32 - 10
Number of quarters left = 22

Therefore, if Marco starts with 32 quarters in his piggy bank and uses 10 quarters to buy the toy car, he will have 22 quarters left in his piggy bank.

Number of pennies taken away = 76 pennies

Step 3: Find the number of pennies left in Lucas's piggy bank.
Number of pennies left = Number of pennies initially - Number of pennies taken away

Step 1: Find the number of pennies Lucas had after his mom took away 76 pennies.
Number of pennies after mom took away 76 = 96 - 76 = 20 pennies

Given information:
- Aiden finds a purse with $31.
- Aiden's neighbor gives him $57 as a reward for washing her car.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Aiden has after finding the purse.
Amount of money from the purse = $31

Step 2: Find the total amount of money Aiden has after receiving the reward.
Total amount of money = Amount of money from the purse + Reward from the neighbor

Given information:
- Ryan saves up $93 by doing his chores.
- He spends $11 on a comic book.
- He spends $64 on a new video game.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining money after buying the comic book.
Initial amount = $93
Amount spent on comic book = $11
Remaining amount after buying comic book = $93 - $11 = $82

Step 2: Calculate the remaining money after buying the video game.
Remaining amount after buying comic book = $82
Amount spent on video game = $64
Remaining amount after buying video game = $82 - $64 = $18

Given information:
- Ryan saves up $93 by doing his chores.
- He spends $26 on a more expensive comic book.
- He spends $64 on a new video game.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining money after buying the more expensive comic book.
Initial amount = $93
Amount spent on comic book = $26
Remaining amount after buying comic book = $93 - $26 = $67

Step 2: Calculate the remaining money after buying the video game.
Remaining amount after buying comic book = $67
Amount spent on video game = $64
Remaining amount after buying video game = $67 - $64 = $3

Therefore, if Ryan bought the more expensive comic book for $26 and the video game for $64, he would have $3 left after buying the video game, assuming he gave all his saved money to his mom, and she gave him back the remaining amount after each purchase.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Ella has in her piggy bank after adding the money she received from her birthday and the money she received as a Christmas gift from her aunt.

Given information:
- Ella has 20 one-dollar bills saved from her birthday.
- Ella's aunt gives her 45 one-dollar bills as a Christmas gift.

Step 1: Find the total number of one-dollar bills Ella has.
Number of one-dollar bills from her birthday + Number of one-dollar bills from her aunt's gift = Total number of one-dollar bills
20 + 45 = 65 one-dollar bills

Step 2: Convert the total number of one-dollar bills to the total amount of money in dollars.
Total amount of money = Total number of one-dollar bills
Total amount of money = 65 dollars

Therefore, Ella has a total of 65 dollars in her piggy bank.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we found that Ella had a total of $65 in her piggy bank after adding her birthday money ($20) and her aunt's Christmas gift ($45).

Given information:
- Ella has $65 in her piggy bank.
- The cost of the new bike is $94.

To find how much more money Ella needs to buy the new bike, we need to subtract the amount of money she has from the cost of the bike.

Step 1: Find the difference between the cost of the bike and the amount of money Ella has.
Cost of the bike - Amount of money Ella has = Additional money needed
$94 - $65 = $29

Therefore, Ella needs an additional $29 to buy the new bike.

Given information:
- Benjamin earns $62 from his part-time job.
- Benjamin gets an extra $10 from his parents as a reward for his grades.

Step 1: Add the amount of money Benjamin earns from his part-time job and the extra money he gets from his parents.
Amount of money Benjamin has in total = Money earned from part-time job + Extra money from parents
Amount of money Benjamin has in total = $62 + $10

Step 1: Add the initial amount in Tom's savings account and the amount he received from his relatives.
Initial amount in savings account + Amount received from relatives = Total amount in savings account after birthday
$71 + $26 = $97

Therefore, after adding the money he received from his relatives to his savings account, Tom now has $97 in his savings account.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we found that Tom had $71 in his savings account initially, and after his birthday, he received $26 from his relatives and added it to his savings account.

To find out how much extra money Tom added to his savings account after his birthday, we need to subtract the initial amount in his savings account from the total amount after adding the money he received.

Given information:
- Initial amount in Tom's savings account = $71
- Total amount in Tom's savings account after adding the money received from relatives = $97

Step 1: Subtract the initial amount from the total amount to find the extra money added.
Extra money added = Total amount after adding - Initial amount
Extra money added = $97 - $71 = $26

Therefore, Tom added $26 extra to his savings account after his birthday, which is the same amount he received from his relatives.

Step 1: Add the initial amount in Tom's savings account and the amount he received from his relatives.
Initial amount in savings account + Amount received from relatives = Total amount in savings account after birthday
$18 + $26 = $44

Therefore, after adding the money he received from his relatives to his initial savings, Tom now has $44 in his savings account.

- He spent $36 on a video game.
- He wants to buy a controller that costs $51.

Amount left after buying video game = Total allowance - Cost of video game
Amount left after buying video game = $94 - $36 = $58

Step 2: Calculate how much money Leo will have left after buying the controller.
Amount left after buying controller = Amount left after buying video game - Cost of controller

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the amount of money Sam had initially with the adjusted amount of money he received as a gift from his aunt.

Given information:
- Sam has $31 in his wallet initially.
- Sam's aunt gifts him $46 for his birthday (instead of $55).

Step 1: Add the initial amount of money Sam had with the adjusted amount of money he received as a gift.
Initial amount of money + Adjusted amount of money received as a gift = Total amount of money
$31 + $46 = $77

Therefore, after receiving the adjusted birthday gift of $46 from his aunt, Sam has a total of $77.

Given information:
- Billy and Ben have a combined total of 88 quarters.

Step 1: Subtract the total number of quarters they have from their goal.
Goal - Total number of quarters they have = Number of quarters needed

Step 1: Find the amount of money Shay has after buying the video game.
Initial amount of money - Cost of the video game = Amount of money after the purchase
$93 - $59 = $34

Step 2: Find the total amount of money Shay has after his friend returns $13.
Amount of money after the purchase + Money returned by his friend = Total amount of money

Step 1: Find the amount of money Shay has after making the $86 purchase.
Initial amount of money - Cost of the purchase = Amount of money after the purchase
$93 - $86 = $7

Step 2: Find the total amount of money Shay has after his friend returns $13.
Amount of money after the purchase + Money returned by his friend = Total amount of money

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount James spent at the store and then subtract it from the amount he had initially.

Given information:
- James had $80 with him.
- James spent $19 on books.
- James spent $57 on a new pair of shoes.

Step 1: Find the total amount James spent at the store.
Amount spent on books + Amount spent on shoes = Total amount spent
$19 + $57 = $76

Step 2: Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount James had.
Initial amount - Total amount spent = Amount left
$80 - $76 = $4

Therefore, James had $4 left after spending $19 on books and $57 on a new pair of shoes.

Given information:
- Liam has saved $54 from doing chores around the house.
- The video game he wants to purchase costs $29.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Liam will have left after purchasing the video game.

- Hannah already has 41 quarters in her piggy bank.

Step 1: Find the number of quarters Jessica has remaining after using 18 quarters.
Number of quarters remaining = Total number of quarters - Number of quarters used
Number of quarters remaining = 69 - 18
Number of quarters remaining = 51

Step 2: Find the total number of quarters Jessica and Hannah have combined.
Total number of quarters = Jessica's remaining quarters + Hannah's quarters

Given information:
- Tom initially had 63 quarters.
- The toy car cost 50 quarters.
- The toy spaceship costs 77 quarters.

Step 1: Find the number of quarters Tom had left after buying the toy car.
Number of quarters left = Initial number of quarters - Cost of the toy car
Number of quarters left = 63 quarters - 50 quarters
Number of quarters left = 13 quarters

Step 2: Find the number of additional quarters Tom needs to buy the toy spaceship.
Additional quarters needed = Cost of the toy spaceship - Remaining quarters
Additional quarters needed = 77 quarters - 13 quarters
Additional quarters needed = 64 quarters
