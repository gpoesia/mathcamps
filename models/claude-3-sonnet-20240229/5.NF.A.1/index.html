        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the least common denominator (LCD) for all the fractions involved.
2. Convert all the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
3. Add the numerators of the first two fractions and subtract the numerator of the third fraction.
4. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.

Step 1: Find the LCD
The LCD for 56, 23, and 26 is 1288 (the least common multiple of 56, 23, and 26).

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
48/56 = (48 Ã— 23)/1288
95/23 = (95 Ã— 56)/1288
34/26 = (34 Ã— 49)/1288

Step 3: Add the numerators of the first two fractions and subtract the numerator of the third fraction.
(48 Ã— 23) + (95 Ã— 56) - (34 Ã— 49) = 1104 + 5320 - 1666 = 4758

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.
4758/1288 = 3694/1000

Therefore, the value that John found for the given operation is 3694/1000.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the least common denominator (LCD) for the fractions 88/9, 28/65, and 18/37.
2. Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the denominator.
3. Add the first two fractions.
4. Subtract the third fraction from the sum.
5. Simplify the resulting fraction, if possible.

Step 1: Find the LCD.
The LCD is the least common multiple of 9, 65, and 37, which is 1885.

Step 2: Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the denominator.
88/9 = (88 Ã— 209)/1885 = 18432/1885
28/65 = (28 Ã— 29)/1885 = 812/1885
18/37 = (18 Ã— 51)/1885 = 918/1885

Step 3: Add the first two fractions.
18432/1885 + 812/1885 = 19244/1885

Step 4: Subtract the third fraction from the sum.
19244/1885 - 918/1885 = 18326/1885

Step 5: Simplify the resulting fraction, if possible.
18326/1885 = 9163/945 (by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2)

Therefore, the result expressed as a simple fraction is 9163/945.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the two fractions and then simplify the result to the lowest terms.

Given:
- (63 / 41) + (44 / 50)

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of 41 and 50.
The LCD of 41 and 50 is 410 (41 Ã— 10 = 410, 50 Ã— 8 = 400).

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
63 / 41 = (63 Ã— 10) / 410 = 630 / 410
44 / 50 = (44 Ã— 8) / 400 = 352 / 410

Step 3: Add the fractions with the same denominator.
(630 / 410) + (352 / 410) = (630 + 352) / 410 = 982 / 410

Step 4: Simplify the fraction to the lowest terms by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 982 and 410 is 41.
982 / 41 = 24
410 / 41 = 10

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 24 / 10 = 2 (2/5).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions and then add the numerators.

Given information:
- John had 71/41 of a cake left.
- Emily added 41/77 of another cake to it.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 41 and 77 to get the common denominator.
LCM of 41 and 77 = 3137

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 3137.
71/41 = (71 Ã— 77) / (41 Ã— 77) = 5447 / 3137
41/77 = (41 Ã— 41) / (77 Ã— 41) = 1681 / 3137

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
(5447 + 1681) / 3137

Step 4: Simplify the fraction, if possible.
7128 / 3137 = 2264 / 997 (simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3)

Therefore, the total amount of cake is 2264/997.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate 10/65 + 56/35, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 65 and 35 is 455.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 455:
10/65 = (10 Ã— 7)/455
56/35 = (56 Ã— 13)/455

Now we can add the fractions:
(10 Ã— 7)/455 + (56 Ã— 13)/455 = (70 + 728)/455 = 798/455

To simplify the fraction 798/455, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7.

798/455 = (798/7)/(455/7) = 114/65

Therefore, the result of 10/65 + 56/35 as a simple fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's start with the result from the previous calculation:
10/65 + 56/35 = 114/65

Now, we need to subtract this fraction from 34.

First, we need to convert 34 to a fraction with the same denominator as 114/65, which is 65.
34 = (34 Ã— 1)/1 = (34 Ã— 1 Ã— 65)/65 = 2210/65

Next, we subtract 114/65 from 2210/65:
2210/65 - 114/65 = (2210 - 114)/65 = 2096/65

To simplify the fraction 2096/65, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 32.

2096/65 = (2096/32)/(65/32) = 64/2 = 32

Now we can add the fractions:
(25 Ã— 7)/455 + (56 Ã— 13)/455 = (175 + 728)/455 = 903/455

To simplify the fraction 903/455, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 57.

2. Now, we need to add 52/71 to 11382/3807.
   To do this, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 3807 and 71.

3. Convert 11382/3807 to have the denominator 270297:

5. Add the fractions:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to calculate 88/1 - 38/53:
   88/1 - 38/53 = 4626/53 (as calculated in the previous problem)

2. Now, we need to add 4626/53 to 25/79:
   To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.
   LCM of 53 and 79 = 4167

3. Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 4167:
   4626/53 = (4626/53) Ã— (79/79) = 364854/4167
   25/79 = (25/79) Ã— (53/53) = 1325/4167

4. Add the fractions:
   364854/4167 + 1325/4167 = 366179/4167

5. Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF):
   GCF of 366179 and 4167 = 1
   366179/4167 Ã· 1/1 = 366179/4167

Therefore, the final value after adding 4626/53 to 25/79 is 366179/4167.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the new fraction 38/93 instead of 38/53.

Given:
- First fraction: 88/1
- Second fraction: 38/93

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 1 and 93.
LCM of 1 and 93 = 93

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 93.
88/1 = 88/1 Ã— 93/93 = 8184/93
38/93 = 38/93 Ã— 1/1 = 38/93

Step 3: Subtract the fractions.
(8184/93) - (38/93) = (8184 - 38)/93 = 8146/93

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
GCF of 8146 and 93 = 1
8146/93 Ã· 1/1 = 8146/93

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 8146/93.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of two fractions, we need to find a common denominator and then add the fractions.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 56 and 50.
The LCM of 56 and 50 is 1400.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1400.
89/56 = (89 Ã— 25)/1400 = 2225/1400
48/50 = (48 Ã— 28)/1400 = 1344/1400

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(2225/1400) + (1344/1400) = (2225 + 1344)/1400 = 3569/1400

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 3569 and 1400 is 1.
3569/1400 = (3569/1)/1400 = 3569/1400

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the sum of 89/56 and 48/50:
   89/56 + 48/50
   = (89 Ã— 25 + 48 Ã— 28) / (56 Ã— 25)  (Finding the LCM of 56 and 50, which is 1400)
   = (2225 + 1344) / 1400
   = 3569 / 1400

2. Now we need to add 2/65 to 3569/1400:
   3569/1400 + 2/65
   = (3569 Ã— 13 + 2 Ã— 216) / (1400 Ã— 13)  (Finding the LCM of 1400 and 65, which is 9100)
   = (46397 + 432) / 9100
   = 46829 / 9100

3. Finally, we need to simplify the fraction 46829/9100:
   The greatest common factor (GCF) of 46829 and 9100 is 1.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 12 and 50.
The LCM of 12 and 50 is 300.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 300.
89/12 = (89 Ã— 25)/300 = 2225/300
48/50 = (48 Ã— 6)/300 = 288/300

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(2225/300) + (288/300) = (2225 + 288)/300 = 2513/300

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 2513 and 300 is 1.

Given:
- 96/11 = 8 72/11
- 12/5 = 2 2/5
- 38/87

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) for 72/11, 2/5, and 38/87.
LCD = 435

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
96/11 = 8 72/11 = 8 (40/1) = 320/435
12/5 = 2 2/5 = 2 (87/87) = 174/435
38/87 = 38/87 = 38/435

Step 3: Add the fractions with the same denominator.
(320/435) + (174/435) = 494/435

Step 4: Subtract 38/435 from the sum.
(494/435) - (38/435) = 456/435

1. Calculate 23/3
2. Calculate 80/91 + 26/24
3. Subtract the sum from 23/3

Step 1: Calculate 23/3
23/3 = 7 (2/3)

Step 2: Calculate 80/91 + 26/24
To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

LCD of 91 and 24 = 1092
80/91 = (80 Ã— 12)/1092 = 960/1092
26/24 = (26 Ã— 45.5)/1092 = 1183/1092

960/1092 + 1183/1092 = 2143/1092

Step 3: Subtract the sum from 23/3
23/3 = 7 (2/3) = 23/3
2143/1092 = 1 (1051/1092)

23/3 - 2143/1092 = (23 Ã— 364 - 2143 Ã— 1)/1092

Now, we need to add 45/94 to this result.

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

LCD of 1092 and 94 = 51432

6229/1092 = (6229 Ã— 47)/51432
45/94 = (45 Ã— 546)/51432

(6229 Ã— 47)/51432 + (45 Ã— 546)/51432 = 293763/51432 + 24570/51432

Step 1: Calculate 23/3
23/3 = 7 (2/3)

Step 2: Calculate 80/91 + 76/24
To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

LCD of 91 and 24 = 1092
80/91 = (80 Ã— 12)/1092 = 960/1092
76/24 = (76 Ã— 45.5)/1092 = 3458/1092

960/1092 + 3458/1092 = 4418/1092

Step 3: Subtract the sum from 23/3
23/3 = 7 (2/3) = 23/3
4418/1092 = 4 (2/1092)

23/3 - 4418/1092 = (23 Ã— 364 - 4418 Ã— 1)/1092
= 8372/1092 - 4418/1092
= 3954/1092

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction
3954/1092 = (3954 Ã· 2)/546 = 1977/546

Therefore, the result of 23/3 minus the sum of 80/91 and 76/24, in its simplest fraction form, is 1977/546.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions and then add the fractions.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 60 to get the common denominator.
LCM of 18 and 60 = 180

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 180.
37/18 = (37 Ã— 10)/180 = 370/180
24/60 = (24 Ã— 3)/180 = 72/180

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(370/180) + (72/180) = 442/180

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
GCF of 442 and 180 = 2
442/180 = (442/2) / (180/2) = 221/90

Therefore, the sum of 37/18 and 24/60 when simplified to the lowest terms is 221/90.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the three fractions and then simplify the result to the lowest terms.

Given:
- Fraction 1 = 37/18
- Fraction 2 = 24/60
- Fraction 3 = 92/28

Step 1: Find the sum of the first two fractions (37/18 and 24/60).
Sum of 37/18 and 24/60 = 221/90 (as calculated in the previous problem)

Step 2: Find the least common denominator (LCD) for the sum of the first two fractions (221/90) and the third fraction (92/28).
LCD of 90 and 28 = 180

Step 3: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 180.
221/90 = (221 Ã— 2)/180 = 442/180
92/28 = (92 Ã— 6.43)/180 = 592/180 (where 6.43 = 180/28)

Step 4: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(442/180) + (592/180) = 1034/180

Step 5: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
GCF of 1034 and 180 = 2
1034/180 = (1034/2) / (180/2) = 517/90

Therefore, the new total after adding the initial sum of 37/18 and 24/60 to the fraction 92/28 and simplifying to the lowest terms is 517/90.

Then, we can add the numerators and keep the LCD as the denominator.

Given fractions: 33/41 and 95/62

Step 1: Find the LCD of 41 and 62.
LCD = 41 Ã— 62 = 2542

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
33/41 = (33 Ã— 62)/2542 = 2046/2542
95/62 = (95 Ã— 41)/2542 = 3895/2542

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the LCD as the denominator.
(2046/2542) + (3895/2542) = (2046 + 3895)/2542 = 5941/2542

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.
GCF of 5941 and 2542 = 1

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the sum of 33/41 and 95/62 (as we did in the previous problem):
   33/41 + 95/62 = 5941/2542

2. Now, we need to add this sum (5941/2542) to the original fraction 95/62:
   5941/2542 + 95/62

3. To add these fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 2542 and 62, which is 2542 Ã— 62 = 157604.

4. Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator:
   5941/2542 = (5941 Ã— 62)/157604 = 368742/157604
   95/62 = (95 Ã— 2542)/157604 = 240490/157604

5. Add the numerators and keep the LCD as the denominator:
   368742/157604 + 240490/157604 = (368742 + 240490)/157604 = 609232/157604

6. Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.
   GCF of 609232 and 157604 = 4
   609232/157604 = (609232/4) / (157604/4) = 152308/39401

Therefore, the final simplified fraction after adding the sum of 33/41 and 95/62 to 95/62 is 152308/39401.

1. Simplify the fractions (64/34) and (3/24) by finding their common denominators and adding them.
2. Simplify the fraction (41/96).
3. Add the results from steps 1 and 2.

Step 1: Finding the common denominator for (64/34) and (3/24)
The least common multiple of 34 and 24 is 102.
(64/34) = (64 Ã— 3/102) = 192/102
(3/24) = (3 Ã— 4/96) = 12/102
(192/102) + (12/102) = 204/102

Step 2: Simplifying (41/96)
(41/96) = (41/96)

Step 3: Adding the results from steps 1 and 2
(204/102) + (41/96) = (204/102) + (41 Ã— (102/102)/96) = (204 + 41 Ã— (102/96))/102 = (204 + 4284/96)/102 = 4488/102 = 44/1

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) for the fractions 83/73 and 53/77.
The LCD is the least common multiple of 73 and 77, which is 5641.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
83/73 = (83 Ã— 77)/5641 = 6391/5641
53/77 = (53 Ã— 73)/5641 = 3869/5641

Step 3: Add the fractions with the same denominator.
6391/5641 + 3869/5641 = 10260/5641 = 'w'

Step 4: Find the LCD for 'w' and 80/76.
The LCD is the least common multiple of 5641 and 76, which is 428716.

Step 5: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
'w' = 10260/5641 = (10260 Ã— 76)/428716 = 779760/428716
80/76 = (80 Ã— 5641)/428716 = 451280/428716

Step 6: Add the fractions with the same denominator.
779760/428716 + 451280/428716 = 1231040/428716

Step 7: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCD.
The GCD of 1231040 and 428716 is 4.
1231040/428716 = (1231040/4)/(428716/4) = 307760/107179

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's add the fractions.

First, we need to find a common denominator for 1031/660 and 58/18.
The least common multiple (LCM) of 660 and 18 is 6660.

Step 1: Convert 1031/660 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 6660.
1031/660 = (1031 Ã— 10)/6660 = 10310/6660

Step 2: Convert 58/18 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 6660.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 41 is 820.

Step 1: Convert 27/20 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 820.
27/20 = (27 Ã— 41)/820 = 1107/820

Step 2: Convert 14/41 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 820.
14/41 = (14 Ã— 20)/820 = 280/820

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this expression, we need to perform the division operations first, and then subtract the results.

Given expression: ((32 / 14) - (22 / 47))

Step 1: Divide 32 by 14
32 / 14 = 2.285714286 (repeating decimal)
We can express this as the fraction 16/7

Step 2: Divide 22 by 47
22 / 47 = 0.468085106 (repeating decimal)
We can express this as the fraction 22/47

Step 3: Subtract the fractions
(16/7) - (22/47)
To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

LCD of 7 and 47 = 329

(16/7) = (16 Ã— 47/7 Ã— 47) = 752/329
(22/47) = (22 Ã— 7/47 Ã— 7) = 154/329

Now, we can subtract:
(752/329) - (154/329) = 598/329

To simplify the fraction 598/329, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 598 and 329, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

GCD of 598 and 329 = 1

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 598/329.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's start with the result we calculated earlier:

((32 / 14) - (22 / 47)) = 598/329

We want to add this result to itself, which means we need to perform the following operation:

(598/329) + (598/329)

To add fractions with the same denominator, we simply add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.

(598/329) + (598/329) = (598 + 598)/329
                      = 1196/329

Now, we need to simplify the fraction 1196/329 by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1196 and 329, and then dividing both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

GCD of 1196 and 329 = 1

Given expression: ((71 / 14) - (22 / 47))

Step 1: Divide 71 by 14
71 / 14 = 5.071428571 (repeating decimal)
We can express this as the fraction 71/14

Step 2: Divide 22 by 47 (same as before)
22 / 47 = 0.468085106 (repeating decimal)
We can express this as the fraction 22/47

Step 3: Subtract the fractions
(71/14) - (22/47)
To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

LCD of 14 and 47 = 658

(71/14) = (71 Ã— 47/14 Ã— 47) = 3337/658
(22/47) = (22 Ã— 14/47 Ã— 14) = 308/658

Now, we can subtract:
(3337/658) - (308/658) = 3029/658

To simplify the fraction 3029/658, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 3029 and 658, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

GCD of 3029 and 658 = 1

Now, we need to add 83/4 to this sum.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3233 and 4 to get the common denominator.
LCM of 3233 and 4 = 12932

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 12932.
6423/3233 = (6423 Ã— 4)/12932 = 25692/12932
83/4 = (83 Ã— 3233)/12932 = 268339/12932

Step 3: Add the fractions with the same denominator.
(25692/12932) + (268339/12932) = 294031/12932

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.
GCF of 294031 and 12932 = 7

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the fractions 14/89 and (24/34 + 44/87), and then simplify the resulting fraction.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) for 14/89, 24/34, and 44/87.
The LCD is the least common multiple of 89, 34, and 87, which is 26326.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
14/89 = (14 Ã— 296)/26326
24/34 = (24 Ã— 774)/26326
44/87 = (44 Ã— 302)/26326

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
(14 Ã— 296)/26326 + (24 Ã— 774)/26326 + (44 Ã— 302)/26326
= 4144/26326 + 18576/26326 + 13288/26326
= 36008/26326

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and then dividing both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.
The GCF of 36008 and 26326 is 2.
36008/26326 = (36008/2) / (26326/2)
= 18004/13163

Therefore, the sum of 14/89 and (24/34 + 44/87) is 18004/13163.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 30 and 60 is 60.

Converting 73/30 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 60:
73/30 = (73 Ã— 2)/60 = 146/60

Now we can add the fractions:
146/60 + 8/60 = (146 + 8)/60 = 154/60

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.

154/60 = (154/2)/(60/2) = 77/30

Therefore, the sum of 73/30 and 8/60 is 77/30.

1. We first need to find the sum of 73/30 and 8/60:
   73/30 + 8/60 = (73 Ã— 2 + 8)/60 = 154/60 = 77/30

2. Now, we need to add 77/30 to itself:
   77/30 + 77/30 = (77 + 77)/30 = 154/30

To simplify the fraction 154/30, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.

154/30 = (154/2)/(30/2) = 77/15

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Original fraction: 73/30

We want to add 49/60 to this fraction.

First, we need to convert 73/30 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 60.
73/30 = (73 Ã— 2)/60 = 146/60

Now we can add the fractions:
146/60 + 49/60 = (146 + 49)/60 = 195/60

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 195 and 60, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The GCD of 195 and 60 is 15.
195/60 = (195/15)/(60/15) = 13/4

Therefore, if we add 49/60 to the original fraction 73/30, we get 13/4.

1. Find a common denominator for the fractions 82/49 and 45/60.
2. Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
3. Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
4. Find a common denominator for the result from step 3 and the fraction 99/59.
5. Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
6. Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
7. Simplify the resulting fraction.

Step 1: The least common multiple (LCM) of 49 and 60 is 1470.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 1470.
82/49 = (82 Ã— 30)/1470 = 2460/1470
45/60 = (45 Ã— 24.5)/1470 = 1102.5/1470

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
d = 2460/1470 + 1102.5/1470 = 3562.5/1470

Step 4: The LCM of 1470 and 59 is 86730.

Step 5: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 86730.
3562.5/1470 = (3562.5 Ã— 59)/86730 = 209937.5/86730
99/59 = (99 Ã— 1470)/86730 = 145530/86730

Step 6: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
209937.5/86730 + 145530/86730 = 355467.5/86730

Step 7: Simplify the resulting fraction.
355467.5/86730 = 4.1/1

Therefore, the resulting sum is 4.1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow the given steps:

Step 1: Subtract 76/30 from 91/16
First, we need to find a common denominator for 91/16 and 76/30. The least common multiple of 16 and 30 is 480.

91/16 = (91 Ã— 30)/480 = 2730/480
76/30 = (76 Ã— 16)/480 = 1216/480

Now, we can subtract:
2730/480 - 1216/480 = 1514/480

Step 2: Add the answer from Step 1 to 18/44
To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator again. The least common multiple of 480 and 44 is 2640.

1514/480 = (1514 Ã— 5.5)/2640 = 8327/2640
18/44 = (18 Ã— 60)/2640 = 1080/2640

Now, we can add:
8327/2640 + 1080/2640 = 9407/2640

To round the final answer to the nearest hundredth, we need to convert the fraction to a decimal:
9407/2640 = 3.5626515151515154

1. Find the value of (78/45) + (89/36)
   - Convert to common denominator of 180
   - (78/45) = (78 Ã— 4)/180 = 312/180
   - (89/36) = (89 Ã— 5)/180 = 445/180
   - (312/180) + (445/180) = 757/180

2. Find the sum of ((78/45) + (89/36)) added to itself
   - (757/180) + (757/180) = 1514/180
   - Simplify: 1514/180 = 757/90

3. Add the original ((78/45) + (89/36)) to the sum from step 2
   - (757/180) + (757/90) 
   - Convert to common denominator of 1260
   - (757/180) = (4217/1260)
   - (757/90) = (8437/1260)
   - (4217/1260) + (8437/1260) = 12654/1260
   - Simplify: 12654/1260 = 1007/100

Therefore, the resultant value when the sum of ((78/45) + (89/36)) added to itself is added to the original ((78/45) + (89/36)) is 1007/100.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step:

Given:
First fraction: 78/93
Second fraction: 89/36

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 93 and 36.
LCM of 93 and 36 = 1332

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1332.
78/93 = (78 Ã— 14)/1332 = 1092/1332
89/36 = (89 Ã— 37)/1332 = 3293/1332

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(1092/1332) + (3293/1332) = 4385/1332

Step 4: Add the sum to itself.
(4385/1332) + (4385/1332) = 8770/1332

Step 5: Simplify the fraction if possible.
8770/1332 = (8770 Ã· 2)/1332 = 4385/666

Therefore, the sum of ((78/93) + (89/36)) added to itself is 4385/666.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Divide 93 by 34 to get the first fraction.
2. Subtract 77/74 from the first fraction.
3. Simplify the resulting fraction.

Step 1: Divide 93 by 34 to get the first fraction.
93 Ã· 34 = 2 with a remainder of 25
25/34 = 25/34

So, the first fraction is 2 + 25/34 = 93/34

Step 2: Subtract 77/74 from 93/34.
93/34 - 77/74 = (93 Ã— 74 - 77 Ã— 34) / (34 Ã— 74)
             = (6882 - 2618) / 2516
             = 4264 / 2516

Step 3: Simplify the resulting fraction 4264/2516.
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4264 and 2516 is 4.
4264 Ã· 4 = 1066
2516 Ã· 4 = 629

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we found that (93/34 - 77/74) = 1066/629.

Now, we need to add this result to the fraction 64/70.

Given:
- (93/34 - 77/74) = 1066/629
- We need to add 64/70 to this result.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 629 and 70.
The LCM of 629 and 70 is 21980.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator (21980).
1066/629 = (1066 Ã— 35)/21980
           = 37310/21980

64/70 = (64 Ã— 314)/21980
       = 20096/21980

Step 3: Add the fractions.
(37310/21980) + (20096/21980) = 57406/21980

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction.
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 57406 and 21980 is 2.
57406 Ã· 2 = 28703

            Recall the previous problem where we had 93 divided by 34 and subtracted the fraction 77/74 from it. Now, let's slightly adjust the scenario.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the new condition.

Given:
- 93 is divided by 34 to get the first fraction.
- We need to subtract 77/51 from the first fraction.

Step 1: Divide 93 by 34 to get the first fraction.
93 Ã· 34 = 2 with a remainder of 25
25/34 = 25/34

So, the first fraction is 2 + 25/34 = 93/34

Step 2: Subtract 77/51 from 93/34.
93/34 - 77/51 = (93 Ã— 51 - 77 Ã— 34) / (34 Ã— 51)
             = (4743 - 2618) / 1734
             = 2125 / 1734

Step 3: Simplify the resulting fraction 2125/1734.
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2125 and 1734 is 17.
2125 Ã· 17 = 125
1734 Ã· 17 = 102

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of two fractions, we need to find a common denominator and then add the fractions.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 35 and 85.
The LCM of 35 and 85 is 1785.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1785.
86/35 = (86 Ã— 51)/1785 = 4386/1785
68/85 = (68 Ã— 21)/1785 = 1428/1785

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(4386/1785) + (1428/1785) = 5814/1785

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 5814 and 1785 is 3.
5814/1785 = (5814/3)/(1785/3) = 1938/595

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the sum of 86/35 and 68/85.
   We found this in the previous problem: 86/35 + 68/85 = 1938/595

2. Now, we need to add this result (1938/595) to 86/35 again.

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD).
The LCD of 595 and 35 is 1785.

So, we convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD of 1785:
1938/595 = (1938 Ã— 3)/1785 = 5814/1785
86/35 = (86 Ã— 51)/1785 = 4386/1785

Now we can add:
(5814/1785) + (4386/1785) = 10200/1785

To simplify, we find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 10200 and 1785, which is 45.

10200/1785 = (10200/45)/(1785/45) = 227/40

Therefore, after adding 1938/595 to 86/35, the result expressed as a simplified fraction is 227/40.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the sum of 96/40 and 11/99
2. Convert the fractions to have a common denominator
3. Add the numerators
4. Subtract 91/65 from the sum
5. Simplify the resulting fraction

Step 1: Find the sum of 96/40 and 11/99
Sum = 96/40 + 11/99

Step 2: Convert the fractions to have a common denominator
The least common multiple of 40 and 99 is 3960.
96/40 = (96 Ã— 99)/3960 = 9504/3960
11/99 = (11 Ã— 40)/3960 = 440/3960

Step 3: Add the numerators
Sum = 9504/3960 + 440/3960 = (9504 + 440)/3960 = 9944/3960

Step 4: Subtract 91/65 from the sum
91/65 = (91 Ã— 61)/3965 = 5551/3965
Sum - 91/65 = 9944/3960 - 5551/3965 = (9944 Ã— 3965 - 5551 Ã— 3960)/15684600 = 4393/15684600

Step 5: Simplify the resulting fraction
4393/15684600 = 1/3565

Therefore, the result when you subtract 91/65 from the sum of 96/40 and 11/99 is 1/3565.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions and then add their numerators.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 81 and 66 is 2,646.

So, we can convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator of 2,646.

90/81 = (90 Ã— 33)/2,646 = 2,970/2,646
2/66 = (2 Ã— 40)/2,646 = 80/2,646

Now, we can add the numerators:
2,970/2,646 + 80/2,646 = 3,050/2,646

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCD of 3,050 and 2,646 is 2.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is:

Given information:
- Oliver has a piece of ribbon that is 56/41 yards long.
- He gets another piece of the same length.

Step 1: Convert the fraction 56/41 to a decimal.
56/41 = 1.3658536585365854 yards

Step 2: Find the length of both pieces of ribbon together.
Length of one piece of ribbon = 1.3658536585365854 yards
Length of both pieces together = 1.3658536585365854 yards Ã— 2
Length of both pieces together = 2.7317073170731707 yards

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions and then add the fractions.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 75 and 92.
The LCM of 75 and 92 is 3,700.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 3,700.
92/75 = (92/75) Ã— (49/49) = (4,508/3,700)
66/92 = (66/92) Ã— (40/40) = (2,640/3,700)

Step 3: Add the fractions.
(4,508/3,700) + (2,640/3,700) = 7,148/3,700

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 7,148 and 3,700 is 4.
7,148/3,700 = (7,148/4) / (3,700/4) = 1,787/925

Step 1: Find the LCD of 65 and 22.
LCD = 65 Ã— 22 = 1430

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple of 5 and 25 is 25.

First, we convert 82/5 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 25:

Now we can subtract the fractions:
410/25 - 98/25 = (410 - 98)/25 = 312/25

To simplify the fraction 312/25, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4:
312/25 = (312/4)/(25/4) = 78/6.25

The fraction 78/6.25 can be written as a mixed number:

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's start with the result I obtained previously:

82/5 - 98/25 = 12.48

To find the answer if I add this result to itself, I need to perform the following calculation:

12.48 + 12.48

To add these mixed numbers, I first need to convert them to improper fractions:

12.48 = (12 * 6.25 + 3) / 6.25 = 78 / 6.25
12.48 = (12 * 6.25 + 3) / 6.25 = 78 / 6.25

Now I can add the fractions:
(78 / 6.25) + (78 / 6.25) = (78 + 78) / 6.25 = 156 / 6.25

To convert this improper fraction to a mixed number, I divide the numerator by the denominator:
156 / 6.25 = 25

Therefore, the result of adding 12.48 to itself is 25.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We originally had 82/5 oranges.
2. We need to convert 82/5 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 90 (the least common multiple of 5 and 90).
   82/5 = (82 Ã— 18)/90 = 1476/90

3. We need to subtract 98/90 oranges from 1476/90 oranges.
   1476/90 - 98/90 = 1378/90

4. To simplify the fraction 1378/90, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2:
   1378/90 = (1378/2)/(90/2) = 689/45

Therefore, if you originally had 82/5 oranges and took away 98/90 oranges, you would have 689/45 oranges left.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 1078:
64/49 = (64 * 22)/1078 = 1408/1078
70/22 = (70 * 49)/1078 = 3430/1078

Now we can add the fractions:

80 / 90 = 8/9
52 / 11 = 4 (with a remainder of 8)
            = 4 + 8/11

Now, we can add these two fractions:
(8/9) + (4 + 8/11)
= (8/9) + (44/11 + 8/11)
= (8/9) + (52/11)
= (88/9 + 52/11)
= (88*11 + 52*9) / (9*11)
= (968 + 468) / 99
= 1436 / 99

To express this as a mixed number, we divide 1436 by 99 to get the whole number part:
1436 / 99 = 14 with a remainder of 50

Therefore, the mixed number representation is:

The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 74 is 1332.

12/18 = (12 Ã— 74)/1332 = 888/1332
91/74 = (91 Ã— 18)/1332 = 1638/1332

Now we can add the fractions:
888/1332 + 1638/1332 = 2526/1332

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 2526 and 1332 is 6.

2526/1332 = (2526/6)/(1332/6) = 421/222

To simplify the fraction 842/222, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 842 and 222.

The GCF of 842 and 222 is 2.

91/74 = (91 Ã— 18)/1332 = 1638/1332

Next, we add the fractions:
5772/1332 + 1638/1332 = 7410/1332

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.

Now, we need to find a common denominator for 277/50 and 86/39.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 50 and 39 is 1950.

277/50 = (277 Ã— 39)/1950 = 10803/1950
86/39 = (86 Ã— 50)/1950 = 4300/1950

Now, we can add the numerators and keep the common denominator:

The GCF of 1297 and 550 is 1.
1297/550 = (1297/1) / (550/1) = 1297/550

Therefore, the sum of the fractions 7/22 and 51/25 is 1297/550.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Evaluate the expression ((68 / 69) + (93 / 7))
   68 / 69 = 0.985507246376812
   93 / 7 = 13.285714285714286
   (0.985507246376812) + (13.285714285714286) = 14.271221532091098

2. Check if the expression ((68 / 69) + (93 / 7)) is a monomial
   A monomial is a single term with variables raised to non-negative integer powers.
   The given expression is not a monomial as it is a sum of two fractions.

3. Add (3 / 46) to the result obtained in step 1
   14.271221532091098 + (3 / 46) = 14.271221532091098 + 0.065217391304348 = 14.336438923395446

4. Express the final result as a simple fraction
   To convert a decimal to a fraction, we need to find the closest fraction with a small denominator.
   14.336438923395446 â‰ˆ 327 / 23

Therefore, the resulting value as a simple fraction is 327 / 23.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

The LCD of 98 and 4 is 196 (the least common multiple of 98 and 4).

Converting 31/98 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 196:
31/98 = (31 Ã— 2)/196 = 62/196

Converting 60/4 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 196:
60/4 = (60 Ã— 49)/196 = 2940/196

Now we can add the fractions:
62/196 + 2940/196 = 3002/196

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator and divide both by the GCF.

The GCF of 3002 and 196 is 2.

3002/196 = (3002/2)/(196/2) = 1501/98

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the sum of 31/98 and 60/4 from the previous problem:
   Sum = 1501/98

2. Now, we need to subtract 41/52 from 1501/98.
   To do this, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 98 and 52, which is 1624.

3. Convert 1501/98 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 1624:
   1501/98 = (1501 Ã— 16.5)/1624 = 24766.5/1624

4. Convert 41/52 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 1624:
   41/52 = (41 Ã— 31)/1624 = 1271/1624

5. Subtract the fractions:
   24766.5/1624 - 1271/1624 = 23495.5/1624

6. Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator:
   GCF of 23495.5 and 1624 is 1.5
   23495.5/1624 = (23495.5/1.5)/(1624/1.5) = 15663/1082

Therefore, the result of subtracting 41/52 from the sum of 31/98 and 60/4 as a simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's add 31/98 and 83/4 as fractions.

First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 98 and 4, which is 196.

Then, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator:

31/98 = (31 Ã— 2)/196 = 62/196
83/4 = (83 Ã— 49)/196 = 4067/196

Now, we can add the fractions:
62/196 + 4067/196 = 4129/196

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and then divide both by the GCF.

The GCF of 4129 and 196 is 1.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is:
4129/196

The least common multiple of 2 and 36 is 36.

So, we convert 3/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 36:
3/2 = (3 Ã— 18)/36 = 54/36

Now we can add the fractions:
(54/36) + (24/36) = (54 + 24)/36 = 78/36

To simplify the fraction 78/36, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 6.

The LCD of 6 and 2 is 6.

So, we convert 7/2 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6:

Now we can add the fractions:
13/6 + 21/6 = (13 + 21)/6 = 34/6

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the least common denominator (LCD) for the fractions 92/54, 90/13, and 46/41.
2. Convert all fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
3. Add the first two fractions.
4. Subtract the third fraction from the sum.
5. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.

Step 1: The LCD for 54, 13, and 41 is 1722 (the least common multiple of 54, 13, and 41).

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
92/54 = (92/54) Ã— (32/32) = 1664/1722
90/13 = (90/13) Ã— (132/132) = 11880/1722
46/41 = (46/41) Ã— (42/42) = 1932/1722

Step 3: Add the first two fractions.
(1664/1722) + (11880/1722) = 13544/1722

Step 4: Subtract the third fraction from the sum.
(13544/1722) - (1932/1722) = 11612/1722

Step 5: Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 11612 and 1722 is 2.
11612/1722 = (11612/2) / (1722/2) = 5806/861

Therefore, the result as a simplified fraction is 5806/861.

Then, we can add the numerators and keep the LCD as the denominator.

Given fractions: 29/20 and 17/72

Step 1: Find the LCD of 20 and 72.
The LCD is the least common multiple of 20 and 72, which is 360.

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 360.
29/20 = (29 Ã— 18)/360 = 522/360
17/72 = (17 Ã— 5)/360 = 85/360

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the denominator as 360.
(522/360) + (85/360) = (522 + 85)/360 = 607/360

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.
The GCF of 607 and 360 is 1.
607/360 = (607/1) / (360/1) = 607/360

Given fractions: 607/360 and 9/68

Step 1: Find the LCD of 360 and 68.
The LCD is the least common multiple of 360 and 68, which is 1440.

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 1440.
607/360 = (607 Ã— 4)/1440 = 2428/1440
9/68 = (9 Ã— 21)/1440 = 189/1440

Step 3: Subtract the numerators and keep the denominator as 1440.
(2428/1440) - (189/1440) = (2428 - 189)/1440 = 2239/1440

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.
The GCF of 2239 and 1440 is 7.
2239/1440 = (2239/7) / (1440/7) = 319/206

Therefore, after subtracting 9/68 from the sum of 29/20 and 17/72, the simplified fraction of the new answer is 319/206.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 29/5 and 17/72, we need to follow the same steps as before: find the least common denominator (LCD), convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator, add the numerators, and simplify the resulting fraction.

Given fractions: 29/5 and 17/72

Step 1: Find the LCD of 5 and 72.
The LCD is the least common multiple of 5 and 72, which is 360.

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 360.
29/5 = (29 Ã— 72)/360 = 2088/360
17/72 = (17 Ã— 5)/360 = 85/360

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the denominator as 360.
(2088/360) + (85/360) = (2088 + 85)/360 = 2173/360

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.
The GCF of 2173 and 360 is 1.
2173/360 = (2173/1) / (360/1) = 2173/360

Therefore, the sum of 29/5 and 17/72 as a simplified fraction is 2173/360.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate ((21/75) + (74/43)) + (10/62), we need to find a common denominator for all the fractions involved. The least common multiple of 75, 43, and 62 is 10,290.

Step 1: Convert all fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 10,290.
21/75 = (21 Ã— 137)/10,290 = 2,877/10,290
74/43 = (74 Ã— 239)/10,290 = 17,686/10,290
10/62 = (10 Ã— 166)/10,290 = 1,660/10,290

Step 2: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
(2,877/10,290) + (17,686/10,290) + (1,660/10,290) = (2,877 + 17,686 + 1,660)/10,290 = 22,223/10,290

Step 3: Simplify the resulting fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.
The GCF of 22,223 and 10,290 is 3.
22,223/10,290 = (22,223/3)/(10,290/3) = 7,407/3,430

Therefore, the simplified result of ((21/75) + (74/43)) + (10/62) is 7,407/3,430.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To compute ((75 / 66) + (81 / 61)), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 75/66 and 81/61.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 66 and 61 is 2006.

So, we can convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator of 2006:
75/66 = (75 Ã— 30)/2006 = 2250/2006
81/61 = (81 Ã— 33)/2006 = 2673/2006

Now, we can add the fractions:
(2250/2006) + (2673/2006) = 4923/2006

To reduce the fraction 4923/2006 to its lowest term, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 4923 and 2006, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The GCD of 4923 and 2006 is 1.

Given information:
- t = 53/18 + 21/99
- We need to find the total sum l of two identical fractions t.

Step 1: Find the value of the fraction t.
To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

LCD of 18 and 99 = 198

53/18 = (53 Ã— 11)/198 = 583/198
21/99 = (21 Ã— 2)/198 = 42/198

t = 583/198 + 42/198
t = 625/198

Step 2: Find the total sum l of two identical fractions t.
l = t + t
l = 625/198 + 625/198
l = 1250/198

Step 3: Simplify the fraction l by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
GCD of 1250 and 198 = 2

l = (1250/2) / (198/2)
l = 625/99

Given information:
- l = 625/99
- We need to add 99/92 to l and find the simplified form of the result, c.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of 99 and 92.
LCD of 99 and 92 = 2772 (99 Ã— 28 = 2772, 92 Ã— 30 = 2760)

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator (LCD).
625/99 = (625 Ã— 28)/2772 = 17500/2772
99/92 = (99 Ã— 30)/2772 = 2970/2772

Step 3: Add the fractions.
c = 17500/2772 + 2970/2772
c = 20470/2772

Step 4: Simplify the fraction c by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

Given information:
- Each fraction is equal to the sum of 76/18 and 21/99.
- We need to find the total sum w of these two identical fractions.

Step 1: Find the value of one fraction.
To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

LCD of 18 and 99 = 198

76/18 = (76 Ã— 11)/198 = 836/198
21/99 = (21 Ã— 2)/198 = 42/198

One fraction = 836/198 + 42/198
One fraction = 878/198

Step 2: Find the total sum w of two identical fractions.
w = One fraction + One fraction
w = 878/198 + 878/198
w = 1756/198

Step 3: Simplify the fraction w by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
GCD of 1756 and 198 = 2

w = (1756/2) / (198/2)
w = 878/99

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate 58/49 + 31/34
   * First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 49 and 34, which is 1666.
   * 58/49 = (58 Ã— 34)/1666 = 1972/1666
   * 31/34 = (31 Ã— 49)/1666 = 1519/1666
   * 1972/1666 + 1519/1666 = 3491/1666

2. Add 3491/1666 to 74/38
   * We need to find the LCD of 1666 and 38, which is 63108.
   * 3491/1666 = (3491 Ã— 38)/63108 = 132658/63108
   * 74/38 = (74 Ã— 1666)/63108 = 123484/63108
   * 132658/63108 + 123484/63108 = 256142/63108

3. Simplify the fraction 256142/63108
   * The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 256142 and 63108 is 6.
   * 256142/63108 = (256142/6)/(63108/6) = 42690/10518

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to calculate the two fractions separately and then add them together.

Given information:
- 100 divided by 76
- 29 divided by 14

Step 1: Calculate 100 divided by 76.
100 Ã· 76 = 1.315789... (repeating decimal)

Step 2: Calculate 29 divided by 14.
29 Ã· 14 = 2.071428... (repeating decimal)

Step 3: Add the two fractions together.
1.315789... + 2.071428... = 3.387217... (repeating decimal)

To simplify the answer, we can convert the repeating decimal to a fraction.

3.387217... = 3 + 0.387217...
0.387217... = 387217/1000000 (repeating decimal)
= 387217/999999 (converting to a fraction)

Therefore, the sum of 100 divided by 76 and 29 divided by 14 can be expressed as:
3 + 387217/999999

            Given that Evan has read 51/18 of his novel, and Olivia has read (8/42) after reading the same amount of novel as Evan, how much of the novel has Olivia read in total? Answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 51/18 and 8/42, and then express them as equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 42 is 126.

Step 1: Express 51/18 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 126.
51/18 = (51 Ã— 7)/126 = 357/126

Step 2: Express 8/42 as an equivalent fraction with denominator 126.
8/42 = (8 Ã— 3)/126 = 24/126

Since Evan has read 51/18 of the novel, and Olivia has read the same amount as Evan, which is 24/126, the total amount of the novel that Olivia has read is:

Total amount read by Olivia = 24/126 + 24/126 = 48/126

To simplify the fraction 48/126, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6.

48/126 = (48/6) / (126/6) = 8/21

Therefore, Olivia has read 8/21 of the novel in total.

Adding these two values:
3.6923076923076925 + 1.4090909090909092 = 5.1013986013986017

Therefore, the sum of 48/13 and 31/22 is 5.1013986013986017.

To express the answer as a fraction, we can convert the decimal to a fraction by finding the closest fraction approximation.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. In the previous problem, we found that the sum of 73/39 and 49/14 is 2933/546.

2. Now we need to add 21/80 to 2933/546.

3. To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

The LCM of 546 and 80 is 21880.

4. Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator of 21880:
2933/546 = (2933 Ã— 40)/21880
21/80 = (21 Ã— 274)/21880

5. Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions:
(2933 Ã— 40)/21880 + (21 Ã— 274)/21880 = 117320/21880 + 5754/21880 = 123074/21880

6. Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 123074 and 21880 is 2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 75/65 and 7/39, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 65 and 39 is 1365.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1365.

75/65 = (75 Ã— 21)/1365 = 1575/1365
7/39 = (7 Ã— 35)/1365 = 245/1365

Now we can add the fractions:
1575/1365 + 245/1365 = 1820/1365

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 5.

1820/1365 = (1820/5) / (1365/5) = 364/273

75/65 + 7/39 = 364/273

Now, we need to add 65/97 to this result.

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 273 and 97.

The LCD of 273 and 97 is 2661 (273 Ã— 9 = 2457, 97 Ã— 27 = 2619, LCM of 2457 and 2619 is 2661).

So, we convert the fractions to have a denominator of 2661:
364/273 = (364 Ã— 9)/2661 = 3276/2661
65/97 = (65 Ã— 27)/2661 = 1755/2661

Now we can add the fractions:
3276/2661 + 1755/2661 = 5031/2661

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 3.

5031/2661 = (5031/3) / (2661/3) = 1677/887

Therefore, the sum of 75/65, 7/39, and 65/97 is 1677/887.

Now, we convert the fractions to have a denominator of 1365:
75/65 = (75 Ã— 21)/1365 = 1575/1365
7/47 = (7 Ã— 29)/1365 = 203/1365

Next, we add the fractions:
1575/1365 + 203/1365 = 1778/1365

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 7.

1778/1365 = (1778/7) / (1365/7) = 254/195

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate (58 / 26) + (58 / 26), we need to first find the value of 58 / 26.

58 / 26 = 2.23076923...

Now, we can add this value to itself:
(58 / 26) + (58 / 26) = 2.23076923... + 2.23076923... = 4.46153846...

To express the answer in simplest form, we can convert the decimal to a fraction.

4.46153846... = 446/100

The simplest form of 446/100 is 223/50.

Therefore, the simplest form of (58 / 26) + (58 / 26) is 223/50.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the value of 'k' first, and then add the additional 47/71 gallons to it.

Given information:
- Alex initially had 69/63 gallons of orange juice.
- Alex bought an additional 77/5 gallons of orange juice.
- The total amount of orange juice after the purchase is 'k' gallons.
- Alex received another 47/71 gallons of orange juice from Sally.

Step 1: Find the value of 'k' gallons.
69/63 + 77/5 = (69 Ã— 5 + 77 Ã— 63) / (63 Ã— 5)
= (345 + 4851) / 315
= 5196 / 315
= 16.49 gallons

Therefore, 'k' = 16.49 gallons.

Step 2: Add the additional 47/71 gallons from Sally to 'k'.
'k' + 47/71 = 16.49 + (47 / 71)
= 16.49 + 0.66197183
= 17.15197183 gallons

Therefore, Alex had a total of 17.15197183 gallons of orange juice after receiving the additional amount from Sally.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses first, and then combine the results.

Given expression: ((100 / 61) + ((39 / 6) + (67 / 49)))

Step 1: Simplify the fractions inside the inner parentheses.
(39 / 6) = 6.5
(67 / 49) = 1.367346939...

Step 2: Add the fractions inside the inner parentheses.
(39 / 6) + (67 / 49) = 6.5 + 1.367346939... = 7.867346939...

Step 3: Simplify the fractions outside the parentheses.
(100 / 61) = 1.639344262...

Step 4: Add the results from Steps 2 and 3.
(100 / 61) + (7.867346939...) = 1.639344262... + 7.867346939... = 9.506691201...

To express the final result as a simplified fraction, we need to convert the decimal to a fraction.

9.506691201... = 9 + 506691201/1000000000
= 9 + (506691201 / 1000000000)
= (9000000000 + 506691201) / 1000000000

83/69 = 83/69

Now we can add the fractions:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the sum of 85/1 and 83/69:
   85/1 = 85
   83/69 = 1.2028985507246377 (approximately)
   Sum = 85 + 1.2028985507246377 = 86.2028985507246377

2. Now, we need to convert this sum to a fraction with the denominator of 86 (since we need to add 21/86 to it):
   86.2028985507246377 = 7412/86 (approximately)

3. Add 21/86 to 7412/86:
   7412/86 + 21/86 = (7412 + 21)/86 = 7433/86

4. Simplify the fraction 7433/86:

The least common multiple (LCM) of 1 and 52 is 52.

85/1 = 85/1 * 52/52 = 4420/52
83/52 = 83/52

Now we can add the fractions:
4420/52 + 83/52 = (4420 + 83)/52 = 4503/52

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 4503 and 52.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 13 and 86.
The LCM of 13 and 86 is 1118.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator 1118.
92/13 = (92 Ã— 86)/1118 = 7912/1118
43/86 = (43 Ã— 13)/1118 = 559/1118

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 32 and 98.
The LCM of 32 and 98 is 3136.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 3136.
67/32 = (67 Ã— 98)/3136 = 6586/3136
10/98 = (10 Ã— 32)/3136 = 320/3136

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(6586/3136) + (320/3136) = (6586 + 320)/3136 = 6906/3136

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 6906 and 3136 is 2.

Step 5: Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCF to simplify the fraction.

Then, we can add the numerators and keep the LCD as the denominator.

Given fractions: 59/52 and 70/32

Step 1: Find the LCD of 52 and 32.
LCD = 52 Ã— 32 / GCD(52, 32)
LCD = 52 Ã— 32 / 4
LCD = 416

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
59/52 = (59 Ã— 8)/416
59/52 = 472/416

70/32 = (70 Ã— 13)/416
70/32 = 910/416

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the LCD as the denominator.
Sum = (472 + 910)/416
Sum = 1382/416

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
GCD of 1382 and 416 is 2
1382/416 = (1382/2) / (416/2)
1382/416 = 691/208

   Sum of 59/52 and 70/32 = 691/208 (as calculated in the previous step)

2. Now, we need to add 42/41 to 691/208:
   To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD).
   LCD of 208 and 41 = 208 Ã— 41 = 8528

   Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator:
   691/208 = (691 Ã— 41)/8528
   691/208 = 28331/8528

   42/41 = (42 Ã— 208)/8528
   42/41 = 8736/8528

   Now, add the numerators and keep the LCD as the denominator:
   28331/8528 + 8736/8528 = (28331 + 8736)/8528
   = 37067/8528

3. Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   GCD of 37067 and 8528 is 1
   37067/8528 = 37067/8528 (already in simplest form)

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
GCD of 1502 and 416 is 2
1502/416 = (1502/2) / (416/2)
1502/416 = 751/208

Therefore, the sum of 74/52 and 70/32 as a simplified fraction is 751/208.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

The LCD of 52 and 82 is 1642 (the least common multiple of 52 and 82).

Converting 20/52 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 1642:
20/52 = (20 Ã— 31)/1642 = 620/1642

Converting 75/82 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 1642:
75/82 = (75 Ã— 20)/1642 = 1500/1642

Now we can add the fractions:
620/1642 + 1500/1642 = 2120/1642

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator and divide both by the GCF.

The GCF of 2120 and 1642 is 2.

2120/1642 = (2120/2) / (1642/2) = 1060/821

Therefore, the simplified result is 1060/821.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 84 and 5 is 420.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 420.

31/5 = (31 Ã— 84)/420 = 2604/420
92/84 = (92 Ã— 5)/420 = 460/420

Now we can subtract:
(2604/420) - (460/420) = 2144/420

To simplify the fraction 2144/420, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 84.

2144/84 = 25.5
420/84 = 5

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 25.5/5 or 51/10.

Given:
- 81/90
- 94/49

Step 1: Find the common denominator for 81/90 and 94/49.
The least common multiple (LCM) of 90 and 49 is 1890.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1890.
81/90 = (81 Ã— 21)/1890 = 1701/1890
94/49 = (94 Ã— 38.57142857)/1890 = 3625/1890

Step 3: Find the sum of the equivalent fractions.
(1701/1890) + (3625/1890) = 5326/1890

Step 4: Double the sum.
Double of (5326/1890) = (5326 Ã— 2)/1890 = 10652/1890

Therefore, the double of the sum of 81/90 and 94/49 is 10652/1890.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the difference between 69/21 and 10/92, we need to first find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 21 and 92 is 1092.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1092.

69/21 = (69 Ã— 52)/1092 = 3588/1092
10/92 = (10 Ã— 12)/1092 = 120/1092

Now we can subtract:
3588/1092 - 120/1092 = 3468/1092

To write the answer as a simple fraction, we need to divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).

The GCF of 3468 and 1092 is 12.

Given fractions:

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 66, 6, and 34.
LCM of 66, 6, and 34 = 1122

Step 2: Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 1122.
78/66 = (78 Ã— 17)/1122 = 1326/1122
28/6 = (28 Ã— 187)/1122 = 5236/1122
90/34 = (90 Ã— 33)/1122 = 2970/1122

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
1326/1122 + 5236/1122 + 2970/1122 = 9532/1122

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and then dividing both by the GCF.
GCF of 9532 and 1122 = 2
9532/1122 = (9532/2) / (1122/2) = 4766/561

4766/561 = (4766 Ã— 61)/34221 = 290146/34221
56/61 = (56 Ã— 561)/34221 = 31416/34221

Step 3: Subtract the fractions.
290146/34221 - 31416/34221 = 258730/34221

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and then dividing both by the GCF.
GCF of 258730 and 34221 = 1
258730/34221 = 258730/34221

Therefore, the result of subtracting 56/61 from the sum of 78/66, 28/6, and 90/34 as a simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find a common denominator for all the fractions and then add the fractions by converting them to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.

Given fractions:
78/66
53/6
90/34

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 66, 6, and 34.
LCM of 66, 6, and 34 = 1122

Step 2: Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 1122.
78/66 = (78 Ã— 17)/1122 = 1326/1122
53/6 = (53 Ã— 187)/1122 = 9911/1122
90/34 = (90 Ã— 33)/1122 = 2970/1122

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
1326/1122 + 9911/1122 + 2970/1122 = 14207/1122

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and then dividing both by the GCF.
GCF of 14207 and 1122 = 1
14207/1122 = 14207/1122

Therefore, the result of adding 78/66, 53/6, and 90/34 together as a simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate (12/7) - (9/23), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions and then subtract the second fraction from the first.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 23 to get the common denominator.
LCM of 7 and 23 = 161

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 161.
12/7 = (12 Ã— 23)/161 = 276/161
9/23 = (9 Ã— 7)/161 = 63/161

Step 3: Subtract the fractions.
(276/161) - (63/161) = 213/161

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
GCF of 213 and 161 = 1
213/161 = (213/1) / (161/1) = 213/161

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

First, we need to find the value of t, which is (12/7) - (9/23).
We calculated this in the previous problem, and the result was 213/161.

So, t = 213/161

Now, we need to calculate (40/11) - t
= (40/11) - (213/161)

To subtract fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

LCM of 11 and 161 = 1771

(40/11) = (40 Ã— 161)/1771 = 6440/1771
(213/161) = (213 Ã— 11)/1771 = 2343/1771

Now we can subtract:
(6440/1771) - (2343/1771) = 4097/1771

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator and divide both by the GCF.

GCF of 4097 and 1771 is 1.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate the difference with the new fractions:

We have:
12/7 crates of oranges
9/48 crates of apples

To subtract these fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD).

The LCD of 7 and 48 is 336.

Now, we convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD of 336:
12/7 = (12 Ã— 48)/336 = 576/336
9/48 = (9 Ã— 7)/336 = 63/336

Subtracting the fractions:
(576/336) - (63/336) = 513/336

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
GCF of 513 and 336 is 9.

Dividing the numerator and denominator by 9:
(513/9) / (336/9) = 57/37

Therefore, the difference between 12/7 crates of oranges and 9/48 crates of apples, simplified to the lowest terms, is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of 95/18 and 51/61, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 61 is 1098.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1098:
95/18 = (95 Ã— 61)/1098 = 5795/1098
51/61 = (51 Ã— 18)/1098 = 918/1098

Now we can add the fractions:
5795/1098 + 918/1098 = 6713/1098

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCD of 6713 and 1098 is 7.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 46 and 84 is 1932.

Step 1: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator (1932).
(93/46) = (93 Ã— 42/46 Ã— 42) = 1953/1932
(51/84) = (51 Ã— 23/84 Ã— 23) = 1173/1932

Step 2: Subtract the numerators.
(1953/1932) - (1173/1932) = (1953 - 1173)/1932 = 780/1932

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 780 and 1932 is 12.
780/1932 = (780/12) / (1932/12) = 65/161

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 79/24 and 79/24, we need to add the fractions.

79/24 + 79/24 = (79 + 79)/24

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 91/76 and 12/22, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 76 and 22 is 532.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 532:
91/76 = (91 Ã— 7)/532 = 637/532
12/22 = (12 Ã— 24)/532 = 288/532

Now we can add the fractions:
637/532 + 288/532 = 925/532

To simplify the fraction 925/532, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 925 and 532.
The GCF of 925 and 532 is 5.

925/532 = (925/5)/(532/5) = 185/106

Therefore, the simplified sum of 91/76 and 12/22 is 185/106.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find a common denominator for 88/93 and 6/47
2. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator
3. Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions
4. Simplify the resulting fraction
5. Add the simplified fraction to 92/4
6. Simplify the final result

Step 1: The least common multiple of 93 and 47 is 4371. This will be our common denominator.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 4371.
88/93 = (88 Ã— 47)/4371 = 4136/4371
6/47 = (6 Ã— 93)/4371 = 558/4371

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
4136/4371 + 558/4371 = 4694/4371

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction.
4694/4371 = 1074/1001

Step 5: Add the simplified fraction to 92/4.
1074/1001 + 92/4 = (1074 Ã— 4 + 92 Ã— 1001)/4004 = 4368/4004

Step 6: Simplify the final result.
4368/4004 = 1092/1001

Therefore, the final answer is 1092/1001.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the fractions 95/83 and (52/21 + 75/67).

First, let's find the sum of 52/21 and 75/67.
We need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 21 and 67, which is 201 (21 Ã— 9 = 189, 67 Ã— 3 = 201).

52/21 = (52 Ã— 9)/189 = 468/189
75/67 = (75 Ã— 3)/201 = 225/201

468/189 + 225/201 = (468 Ã— 201 + 225 Ã— 189) / (189 Ã— 201)
                  = 93768 + 42525 / 37989
                  = 136293 / 37989
                  = 3 58/37989

Now, we need to add 95/83 and 3 58/37989.
The LCD of 83 and 37989 is 83 Ã— 457 = 37989.

95/83 = (95 Ã— 457) / 37989 = 43415 / 37989
3 58/37989 = 3 58/37989

43415/37989 + 3 58/37989 = (43415 + 3 Ã— 37989 + 58) / 37989
                          = 43415 + 113967 + 58 / 37989
                          = 157440 / 37989
                          = 4 5/37989

Therefore, the sum of 95/83 and (52/21 + 75/67) as a simplified fraction is 4 5/37989.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to perform the division operations and then subtract the resulting values.

Given expression: ((73 / 27) - (23 / 48))

Step 1: Simplify the fraction 73 / 27
73 / 27 = 2 (with a remainder of 19)
73 / 27 = 2 + (19 / 27)
73 / 27 = 2 + (19 Ã— 4 / 108)
73 / 27 = 2 + (76 / 108)
73 / 27 = 2 69/108

Step 2: Simplify the fraction 23 / 48
23 / 48 = 23 Ã— 2 / 96
23 / 48 = 46 / 96
23 / 48 = 23 / 48

Step 3: Subtract the fractions
(2 69/108) - (23 / 48)
= (2 69/108) - (46 / 96)
= (2 69/108) - (23 / 48)
= (264 / 108) - (46 / 96)
= (264 Ã— 4 / 432) - (46 Ã— 4 / 384)
= 1056 / 432 - 184 / 384
= 1056 / 432 - 552 / 1152
= 504 / 1152

Therefore, the value of the expression ((73 / 27) - (23 / 48)) as a simplified fraction is 7/16.

53/4 = 53/4

Now we can add the fractions:
136/4 + 53/4 = (136 + 53)/4 = 189/4

To express the answer as a mixed number, we divide 189 by 4 to get the whole number part and the remainder as the fractional part.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we found that 34/1 + 53/4 = 47 1/4.

To add 24/67 to 47 1/4, we need to convert the mixed number to an improper fraction first.

47 1/4 = (47 Ã— 4 + 1)/4 = 189/4

Now we can add the fractions 24/67 and 189/4.

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

The LCD of 67 and 4 is 268.

24/67 = 24/67 * 4/4 = 96/268
189/4 = 189/4 * 67/67 = 12663/268

Now we can add the fractions:
96/268 + 12663/268 = 12759/268

To express the answer as a mixed number, we divide 12759 by 268 to get the whole number part and the remainder as the fractional part.

34/97 = 34/97 * 4/4 = 136/388
53/4 = 53/4 * 97/97 = 5141/388

Now we can add the fractions:
136/388 + 5141/388 = (136 + 5141)/388 = 5277/388

To express the answer as a mixed number, we divide 5277 by 388 to get the whole number part and the remainder as the fractional part.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 95 and 74 to get the common denominator.
LCM of 95 and 74 = 6,630

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 6,630.
92/95 = (92 Ã— 69.8947...)/6,630 = 6,430/6,630
4/74 = (4 Ã— 89.5945...)/6,630 = 358/6,630

Step 3: Add the fractions.
(6,430/6,630) + (358/6,630) = 6,788/6,630

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
GCD of 6,788 and 6,630 = 2
6,788/6,630 = (6,788/2) / (6,630/2) = 3,394/3,315

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the value of 'v' first, and then add it to 88/72.

Given information:
- v = 69/47
- d = 88/72 + v

Step 1: Find the value of v.
v = 69/47

Step 2: Find the value of 88/72.
88/72 = 1.22222...

Step 3: Add v to 88/72 to find the value of d.
d = 88/72 + v
d = 1.22222... + 69/47
d = 1.22222... + 1.46808...
d = 2.69030...

To express the final answer as a fraction, we need to find the common denominator for 1.22222... and 1.46808....

The common denominator is 144 (since 72 Ã— 2 = 144 and 47 Ã— 3 = 141).

d = (88 + 69) / 144
d = 157 / 144

Therefore, the value of d is 157/144.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions, perform the subtraction, and then convert the result back to a mixed fraction or a simple fraction, if possible.

Given information:
- The wholesaler initially has 41/26 barrels of olive oil.
- They sell 41/72 barrels of olive oil.

Step 1: Convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions.
41/26 = (41 Ã— 1 + 0) / 26 = 41/26
41/72 = (41 Ã— 0 + 0) / 72 = 0 + 41/72 = 41/72

Step 2: Perform the subtraction.
(41/26) - (41/72) = (41 Ã— 72/72 - 41 Ã— 26/72) / 72
= (2952/72 - 1066/72) / 72
= 1886/72

Step 3: Convert the result to a simple fraction, if possible.
1886/72 = (1886 Ã— 1/72) / 1
= 26 + (14/72)

Therefore, the amount of olive oil the wholesaler has now is 14/72 barrels.

49/2 = (49 Ã— 33)/66 = 1617/66

Now we can add the fractions:
24/66 + 1617/66 = 1641/66

To convert the improper fraction 1641/66 to a mixed fraction, we divide 1641 by 66:

Now, we need to add 17/94 to this result.

First, we need to find the LCD of 66 and 94, which is 1862.

Converting the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD of 1862:
24 57/66 = 24 (28/33) = (24 Ã— 28) + (57 Ã— 28)/1862 = 672 + 1596/1862
17/94 = (17 Ã— 19.7234)/1862 = 335/1862

Now, we can add the fractions:
672 + 1596/1862 + 335/1862 = 672 + 1931/1862

To convert the improper fraction 1931/1862 to a mixed fraction, we divide 1931 by 1862:
1931 Ã· 1862 = 1 with a remainder of 69

Therefore, the final mixed fraction is 673 69/1862.

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

The LCD of 84 and 2 is 84.

Converting the fractions:
12/84 (no need to convert, as the denominator is already 84)
49/2 = (49 Ã— 42)/84 = 2058/84

Now we can add the fractions:
12/84 + 2058/84 = 2070/84

To convert the improper fraction 2070/84 to a mixed fraction, we divide 2070 by 84:

16/7 = (16 Ã— 90)/630 = 1440/630
11/90 = (11 Ã— 7)/630 = 77/630

Now we can add the fractions:
1440/630 + 77/630 = 1517/630

To simplify the fraction 1517/630, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 1517 and 630.
