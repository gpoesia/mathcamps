            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Following up on our previous comparison, now consider these two numbers and fill in the blank with one of these operators: &lt;, &gt;, or =.
4 _ 10 

For instance, if in our previous question we were comparing the heights of two trees (8 feet and 10 feet respectively), this question would now be comparing a shrub of 4 feet to that same 10 feet tree. Which symbol would be appropriate now?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this case, we are comparing 4 and 10.

Given:
- The first number is 4.
- The second number is 10.

Since 4 is less than 10, we need to use the less than operator (&lt;) to fill in the blank.

Therefore, the correct comparison is:

4 &lt; 10

Just like in the previous example, where we compared the heights of a tree (10 feet) and a shorter tree (8 feet), in this case, we are comparing the height of a shrub (4 feet) to the same tree (10 feet).

3 _ 8

Fill in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or = to complete the comparison. For example, if previously you were comparing the heights of two trees, consider this comparison for a scenario where the first tree is now shorter, standing at 3 meters instead of 4. How does this change your comparison?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we were comparing 7 and 6, where 7 is greater than 6, so the correct relationship was 7 &gt; 6.

Now, we are comparing 4 and 6.

Since 4 is less than 6, the correct relationship is:

4 &lt; 6

The change in this new comparison is that the order of the numbers has been reversed, with the smaller number (4) on the left side and the larger number (6) on the right side.

When comparing two numbers using the symbols &lt;, &gt;, or =, the smaller number should be on the left side, and the larger number should be on the right side.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To decide whether the inequality 9 _ 2 is true or false, we need to compare the values of 9 and 2.

Since 9 is greater than 2, we should fill in the blank space with the greater than symbol (&gt;).

Therefore, the correct inequality is:

9 &gt; 2

This inequality is true because 9 is indeed greater than 2.

Since 3 is less than 4, we fill in the blank with the less than symbol (&lt;).

When 8 is replaced by 4, the relationship between the two numbers changes from 3 being less than 8 to 3 being less than 4. However, the inequality symbol (&lt;) remains the same because 3 is still the smaller number in both cases.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous comparison, we had 5 &gt; 1, where 5 is greater than 1.

For the new comparison, 10 _ 1, we need to determine the relationship between 10 and 1.

Since 10 is a larger number than 1, the relationship remains the same as the previous comparison.

Therefore, the correct comparison is:

10 &gt; 1

The comparison does not change from the previous one because 10 is still greater than 1, just like 5 was greater than 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Yes, the comparison from the earlier problem can help in this situation as well.

In the previous problem, we compared 4 and 10, and determined that 4 &lt; 10 (4 is less than 10).

Now, we are comparing 2 and 10.

Since 2 is even smaller than 4, and we know that 4 is less than 10, it follows that 2 is also less than 10.

Therefore, the correct comparison is:

2 &lt; 10

&lt; (less than) if the number on the left is smaller than the number on the right.

In this case, we need to compare 2 and 9.

Since 2 is smaller than 9, we use the &lt; symbol.

2 &lt; 9

            In the above comparison you made between 2 and 9, now let's change the second number. Suppose we change the number 9 to 4. Compare them using the symbols &lt;, &gt;, or =. So, the new equation to solve will be:

2 _ 4

            In the previous statement, you compared the numbers 8 and 7. Now consider a different scenario: 

Fill in the blank in the statement 
5 _ 7
with either a &lt;, &gt;, or = sign to compare the numbers. How does this comparison differ from the earlier one?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this scenario, we need to compare the numbers 5 and 7.

Given:
- The first number is 5.
- The second number is 7.

Since 5 is less than 7, the appropriate symbol to fill in the blank is the less than symbol (&lt;).

Therefore, the correct comparison is:

5 &lt; 7

This comparison differs from the earlier one (8 &gt; 7) because the order of the numbers has changed. In the previous comparison, 8 was greater than 7, but in this case, 5 is less than 7.
