Given information:
- The lengths of four sides of the regular pentagon are 70 cm, 36 cm, 53 cm, and 45 cm.
- The total perimeter of the regular pentagon is 300 cm.

Step 1: Find the sum of the lengths of the four given sides.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the perimeter and the side lengths of a regular polygon.
Perimeter of a regular polygon = Sum of all side lengths
For a regular pentagon with side lengths s, the perimeter = 5s

Step 2: Set up an equation using the given perimeter.
Perimeter = 5s
310 = 5s

Step 3: Solve for the side length s.

- The octagon is regular, which means all sides are equal in length.
- The perimeter of the octagon is 544 meters.

Step 1: Find the number of sides in an octagon.
An octagon has 8 sides.

Step 2: Find the length of one side using the formula for the perimeter of a regular polygon.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the perimeter of a regular polygon and the length of one of its sides.

Given information:
- The polygon is a regular decagon (10-sided polygon).
- The perimeter of the decagon is 960 meters.

Let's denote the length of one side as s.

For a regular polygon with n sides, the perimeter is given by the formula:
Perimeter = n Ã— s

In our case, n = 10 (decagon), and the perimeter is 960 meters.

Substituting the values, we get:
960 = 10 Ã— s
s = 960 / 10
s = 96 meters

Therefore, the length of one side of the regular decagon with a perimeter of 960 meters is 96 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the length of each side of the regular decagon given its perimeter.

Given information:
- The shape is a regular decagon (a polygon with 10 sides).
- The perimeter of the decagon is 360 meters.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the perimeter and the side lengths of a regular polygon.
For a regular polygon with n sides and side length s, the perimeter is given by:
Perimeter = n Ã— s

Step 2: Substitute the given values into the formula.
Perimeter = n Ã— s
360 m = 10 Ã— s (since a decagon has 10 sides)

Step 3: Solve for the side length, s.
s = 360 m / 10
s = 36 m

Therefore, the length of each side of the regular decagon with a perimeter of 360 meters is 36 meters.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the regular polygon is 418 meters.

Perimeter of a regular polygon = Number of sides Ã— Length of each side
418 m = 11 Ã— Length of each side

Step 2: Solve for the length of each side.
Length of each side = Perimeter of the polygon / Number of sides
Length of each side = 418 m / 11

- The lengths of the 10 known sides are: 97m, 93m, 35m, 1m, 27m, 86m, 68m, 96m, 45m, and 61m.

Step 1: Find the sum of the lengths of the 10 known sides.
Sum of the lengths of the 10 known sides = 97m + 93m + 35m + 1m + 27m + 86m + 68m + 96m + 45m + 61m
Sum of the lengths of the 10 known sides = 609m

Step 2: Find the length of the unknown 11th side by subtracting the sum of the lengths of the 10 known sides from the total perimeter.
Length of the unknown 11th side = Total perimeter - Sum of the lengths of the 10 known sides
Length of the unknown 11th side = 663m - 609m

Given information:
- The octagon has a perimeter of 744 meters.
- All sides of the octagon are equal in length.

Step 1: Find the number of sides in an octagon.
An octagon has 8 sides.

Step 2: Set up an equation to relate the perimeter and the side lengths.
Let x be the length of each side.
Perimeter of an octagon = Sum of all side lengths
744 = 8x

Step 3: Solve for x (the length of each side).
744 = 8x
x = 744 / 8
x = 93 meters

Therefore, the length of each side of the octagon is 93 meters.

Sum of the lengths of 11 sides = 462 cm

Step 2: Find the length of the remaining side by subtracting the sum of the lengths of 11 sides from the total perimeter.
Length of the remaining side = Total perimeter - Sum of the lengths of 11 sides

- The polygon has eight sides.
- The lengths of seven sides are: 28m, 37m, 51m, 84m, 54m, 31m, 94m, and 12m.
- The total perimeter of the polygon is 399m.

Step 1: Find the sum of the given side lengths.
Sum of the given side lengths = 28m + 37m + 51m + 84m + 54m + 31m + 94m + 12m
Sum of the given side lengths = 391m

Step 2: Find the length of the remaining unknown side.

Given information:
- The nonagon is regular, which means all sides are equal in length.
- The perimeter of the nonagon is 342 meters.

Step 1: Find the number of sides of the nonagon.
Number of sides = 9

Step 2: Find the length of one side using the formula for the perimeter of a regular polygon.
Perimeter of a regular polygon = Number of sides Ã— Length of one side

Given information:
- A nonagon is a nine-sided polygon.
- The nonagon has equal side lengths.
- The entire perimeter of the nonagon is 657 meters.

Step 1: Find the number of sides of the nonagon.
Number of sides = 9

Step 2: Since all sides are equal, we can divide the total perimeter by the number of sides to find the length of each side.
Length of each side = Total perimeter / Number of sides
Length of each side = 657 meters / 9
Length of each side = 73 meters

Therefore, each side of the regular nonagon with a total perimeter of 657 meters is 73 meters long.

Then, we can divide the sum of the unknown side lengths by 2 to find the length of one of the unknown sides.

Given information:
- A decagon has 10 sides.
- 8 sides have known lengths: 24m, 25m, 75m, 38m, 18m, 42m, and 61m.
- The total perimeter of the decagon is 359m.

Step 1: Find the sum of the known side lengths.
Sum of known side lengths = 24m + 25m + 75m + 38m + 18m + 42m + 61m
Sum of known side lengths = 283m

Step 2: Find the sum of the unknown side lengths.
Sum of unknown side lengths = Total perimeter - Sum of known side lengths
Sum of unknown side lengths = 359m - 283m
Sum of unknown side lengths = 76m

Step 3: Find the length of one of the unknown sides.
Since there are 2 unknown sides, we can divide the sum of unknown side lengths by 2.
Length of one unknown side = Sum of unknown side lengths / 2

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the fifth side of the pentagon using the given information about the other four side lengths and the total perimeter.

Given information:
- Side lengths: 22m, 14m, 93m, and 75m.
- Total perimeter of the pentagon = 234m.

Step 1: Find the sum of the given four side lengths.
Sum of the given side lengths = 22m + 14m + 93m + 75m = 204m

Step 2: Find the length of the fifth side by subtracting the sum of the given side lengths from the total perimeter.
Length of the fifth side = Total perimeter - Sum of the given side lengths
Length of the fifth side = 234m - 204m = 30m

Therefore, the length of the fifth side of the pentagon is 30m.

### Answer: 30m</pre>
