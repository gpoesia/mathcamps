        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of an equilateral triangle, which is:

Perimeter = 3 Ã— side length

Given information:
- The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 990 cm.

Step 1: Set up the equation using the given information.
990 = 3 Ã— side length

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the side length.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of all three sides.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the triangle is 997 meters.
- Two sides of the triangle have lengths of 2 meters and 667 meters.

Let's represent the length of the third side as x.

According to the perimeter formula:
Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3
997 = 2 + 667 + x

Rearranging the terms, we get:
x = 997 - 2 - 667
x = 328

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of an equilateral triangle, which is:

Perimeter = 3 Ã— side length

Given information:
- The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 564 cm.

Step 1: Set up the equation using the given information.
564 = 3 Ã— side length

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the side length.
Side length = 564 / 3
Side length = 188 cm

Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle with a perimeter of 564 cm is 188 cm.

Given information:
- The triangle is equilateral, which means all sides have equal lengths.
- The perimeter of the triangle is 594 cm.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the perimeter and the side lengths of an equilateral triangle.
Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = Sum of the lengths of all three sides
Perimeter = Side length + Side length + Side length
Perimeter = 3 Ã— Side length

Step 2: Substitute the given perimeter value and solve for the side length.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 453 cm.
- In an equilateral triangle, all three sides have equal lengths.

Let's represent the length of each side as x.

Since the perimeter is the sum of all the sides, we can write the equation:
Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3
453 = x + x + x
453 = 3x

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 453 / 3
x = 151

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of the third side of a triangle, we can use the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

Given information:
- Total perimeter of the triangle = 898 meters
- Length of one side = 250 meters
- Length of another side = 435 meters

Step 1: Find the sum of the lengths of the two known sides.
Sum of the lengths of the two known sides = 250 meters + 435 meters = 685 meters

Step 2: Find the length of the third side using the triangle inequality theorem.
Length of the third side = Total perimeter - Sum of the lengths of the two known sides
Length of the third side = 898 meters - 685 meters = 213 meters

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 213 meters.

Properties of an equilateral triangle:
- All three sides have equal lengths.
- All three angles are equal to 60 degrees.

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides.

Let's denote the length of each side as x.

Since the triangle is equilateral, all three sides have the same length x.

Perimeter of the triangle = Sum of the lengths of the three sides
612 meters = x + x + x
612 meters = 3x

Let's represent the length of each side as x.

Since there are three sides of equal length, we can write:
x + x + x = 513

Simplifying the equation:
3x = 513

Dividing both sides by 3:
x = 513 / 3
x = 171

Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 171 km.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the triangular field is 828 meters.
- Two sides of the field are 105 meters and 434 meters long.

Let's represent the length of the third side as x.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the properties of an equilateral triangle.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the triangle is 105 meters.
- All sides of the triangle are equal in length.

Properties of an equilateral triangle:
- An equilateral triangle has three equal sides.
- The sum of the lengths of the three sides is equal to the perimeter.

Let's represent the length of one side as x.

Since all sides are equal, we can write:
x + x + x = 105 (Perimeter)
3x = 105

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
x = 105 / 3
x = 35

Therefore, the length of one side of the equilateral triangle is 35 meters.

Given information:
- The triangle is equilateral, which means all sides have equal lengths.

Let's represent the length of each side as x.

Since the triangle is equilateral, we can write the perimeter as:

Given information:
- The perimeter of the triangle is 804 meters.
- One side of the triangle is 262 meters long.
- Another side of the triangle is 90 meters long.

Let's represent the length of the third side as x.

According to the perimeter formula:
Perimeter = Sum of the lengths of all three sides
804 = 262 + 90 + x

Rearranging the equation to find x:
x = 804 - 262 - 90
x = 452

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 452 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of all three sides.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the triangle is 677 meters.
- One side of the triangle measures 109 meters.
- Another side of the triangle measures 530 meters.

Let's represent the length of the third side as x.

According to the perimeter formula:
Perimeter = Sum of all three sides
677 = 109 + 530 + x

Rearranging the terms, we get:
x = 677 - 109 - 530
x = 38 meters

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 38 meters.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the triangle is 499 meters.
- The length of the largest side is 259 meters.
- The length of one of the other sides is 11 meters.

Step 1: Find the sum of the lengths of the two known sides.
Sum of the known sides = 259 meters + 11 meters = 270 meters

Step 2: Find the length of the unknown side using the property that the sum of the lengths of all sides is equal to the perimeter.
Perimeter = Sum of the lengths of all sides
499 meters = 270 meters + Length of the unknown side
Length of the unknown side = 499 meters - 270 meters

Given information:
- The triangle is equilateral, which means all sides have equal lengths.
- The perimeter of the triangle is 966 meters.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the perimeter and the side lengths of an equilateral triangle.
Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = Sum of the lengths of all three sides
Perimeter = Side length + Side length + Side length
Perimeter = 3 Ã— Side length

Step 2: Substitute the given perimeter value and solve for the side length.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of all three sides.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the triangle is 915 cm.
- One side of the triangle is 484 cm.
- Another side of the triangle is 130 cm.

Let's represent the length of the third side as x.

According to the perimeter formula:
Perimeter = Sum of all three sides
915 cm = 484 cm + 130 cm + x

Rearranging the terms, we get:
x = 915 cm - 484 cm - 130 cm
x = 301 cm

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 301 cm.

Given information:
- The triangle is equilateral, which means all sides have equal length.
- The perimeter of the triangle is 120 cm.

Step 1: Find the length of one side of the triangle.
Perimeter of a triangle = Sum of the lengths of all three sides
120 cm = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3
Since all sides are equal in an equilateral triangle, let's represent the length of each side as x.
120 cm = x + x + x
120 cm = 3x
x = 120 cm / 3
x = 40 cm

Therefore, each side of the equilateral triangle has a length of 40 cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of an equilateral triangle, which is:

Perimeter = 3 Ã— side length

Given information:
- The perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 501 feet.

Step 1: Set up the equation using the given information.
501 = 3 Ã— side length

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to find the side length.
side length = 501 / 3
side length = 167

Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 167 feet.

            A triangle has sides of lengths 464m and 377m respectively. If the total perimeter of the triangle is 907m, what is the length of the third side?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of all three sides.

Given information:
- One side of the triangle has a length of 464 meters.
- Another side of the triangle has a length of 377 meters.
- The total perimeter of the triangle is 907 meters.

Let's denote the length of the third side as x.

According to the perimeter formula, we have:
Perimeter = Sum of the lengths of all three sides
907 = 464 + 377 + x

Rearranging the terms, we get:
x = 907 - 464 - 377
x = 66

Therefore, the length of the third side of the triangle is 66 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the length of each side of the equilateral triangle given its perimeter.

Given information:
- The triangle is equilateral, which means all sides have equal lengths.
- The perimeter of the triangle is 966 meters.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the perimeter and the side lengths of an equilateral triangle.
Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = Sum of the lengths of all three sides
Perimeter = Side length + Side length + Side length
Perimeter = 3 Ã— Side length

Step 2: Substitute the given perimeter value and solve for the side length.
966 meters = 3 Ã— Side length
Side length = 966 meters / 3
Side length = 322 meters

Therefore, each side of the equilateral triangle has a length of 322 meters.
