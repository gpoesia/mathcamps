        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find all factor pairs of a number, we need to find all the pairs of numbers that multiply together to give that number.

For 64, we can start by finding the factors:
1 x 64 = 64
2 x 32 = 64
4 x 16 = 64
8 x 8 = 64

These are all the factor pairs of 64.

We can list them out as follows:
(1, 64)
(2, 32)
(4, 16)
(8, 8)

Note that (8, 8) is the same as (8, 8), so we only need to list it once.

Therefore, the factor pairs of 64 are:
(1, 64)
(2, 32)
(4, 16)
(8, 8)

For 81, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with 1 and 81 as the first pair of factors.
2. Divide 81 by 2 to get 40.5. Since 81 is not divisible by 2, we move on.
3. Divide 81 by 3 to get 27. This is a factor pair: 3 and 27.
4. Divide 81 by 4 to get 20.25. Since 81 is not divisible by 4, we move on.
5. Divide 81 by 5 to get 16.2. Since 81 is not divisible by 5, we move on.
6. Divide 81 by 6 to get 13.5. Since 81 is not divisible by 6, we move on.
7. Divide 81 by 7 to get 11.57. Since 81 is not divisible by 7, we move on.
8. Divide 81 by 8 to get 10.125. Since 81 is not divisible by 8, we move on.
9. Divide 81 by 9 to get 9. This is a factor pair: 9 and 9.

Here are the steps to find the factor pairs of 59:

1. Start with 1 and the number itself (59).
2. Check if 1 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 1 = 59, so 1 and 59 are a factor pair.
3. Check if 2 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 2 is not a whole number, so 2 is not a factor of 59.
4. Check if 3 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 3 is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor of 59.
5. Check if 4 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 4 is not a whole number, so 4 is not a factor of 59.
6. Check if 5 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 5 is not a whole number, so 5 is not a factor of 59.
7. Check if 6 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 6 is not a whole number, so 6 is not a factor of 59.
8. Check if 7 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 7 is not a whole number, so 7 is not a factor of 59.
9. Check if 8 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 8 is not a whole number, so 8 is not a factor of 59.
10. Check if 9 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 9 is not a whole number, so 9 is not a factor of 59.
11. Check if 10 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 10 is not a whole number, so 10 is not a factor of 59.
12. Check if 11 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 11 is not a whole number, so 11 is not a factor of 59.
13. Check if 12 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 12 is not a whole number, so 12 is not a factor of 59.
14. Check if 13 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 13 = 4 (with a remainder of 7), so 13 is not a factor of 59.
15. Check if 14 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 14 is not a whole number, so 14 is not a factor of 59.
16. Check if 15 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 15 is not a whole number, so 15 is not a factor of 59.
17. Check if 16 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 16 is not a whole number, so 16 is not a factor of 59.
18. Check if 17 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 17 = 3 (with a remainder of 16), so 17 and 3 are a factor pair.
19. Check if 18 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 18 is not a whole number, so 18 is not a factor of 59.
20. Check if 19 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 19 = 3 (with a remainder of 2), so 19 is not a factor of 59.
21. Check if 20 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 20 is not a whole number, so 20 is not a factor of 59.
22. Check if 21 divides 59 evenly. 59 Ã· 21 is not a whole number, so 21 is not a factor of 59.

The factors of 43 are:

To find the remaining factor pairs, we can divide 43 by each number from 2 up to the square root of 43 (which is approximately 6.56) and check if the division is exact (i.e., the remainder is zero). If so, then we have found a factor pair.

2 goes into 43 with a remainder, so 2 is not a factor.
3 goes into 43 with a remainder, so 3 is not a factor.
4 goes into 43, leaving a remainder of 3, so 4 is not a factor.
5 goes into 43, leaving a remainder of 3, so 5 is not a factor.
6 goes into 43, leaving a remainder of 1, so 6 is not a factor.
7 goes into 43, leaving a remainder of 0, so 7 is a factor. The factor pair is 7 and 43/7 = 6.

Here are the steps to find the factor pairs of 91:

1. Start with 1 and the number itself (91).
   This is always a factor pair: 1 Ã— 91 = 91

2. Check for other factors by dividing 91 by consecutive numbers starting from 2.
   If the division is exact (with no remainder), then the divisor and the quotient form a factor pair.

3. Stop when the divisor becomes greater than the square root of 91 (approximately 9.54).

Following these steps, we get the factor pairs of 91:

1 Ã— 91
7 Ã— 13

3. If a number divides 97 evenly, pair it with the quotient obtained by dividing 97 by that number.
4. Repeat step 3 until you reach the square root of 97.

Following these steps, we get the factor pairs of 97 as:

Since no other number between 1 and the square root of 97 divides 97 evenly, we have found all the factor pairs of 97.

Here are the steps to find the factor pairs of 94:

1. Start with 1 and the number itself (94).
2. Find the numbers that divide into 94 evenly.
3. Pair up each divisor with its corresponding quotient.

The factor pairs of 94 are:

1 and 94
2 and 47

Since 94 is an even number, we can also list the factor pairs in reverse order:

47 and 2
94 and 1

Therefore, the complete list of factor pairs of 94 is:
1 and 94
2 and 47
47 and 2

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find all the factor pairs of a number, we need to find all the pairs of numbers that multiply together to give that number.

Here are the steps to find the factor pairs of 83:

1. Start with 1 and 83 as the first pair of factors.
2. Check if any number between 1 and the square root of 83 (approximately 9.11) divides 83 evenly.
3. If a number divides 83 evenly, pair it with the quotient obtained by dividing 83 by that number.

Following these steps, we get the factor pairs of 83 as:

1 and 83
83 and 1

Now, checking for numbers between 1 and 9 that divide 83 evenly:
2 does not divide 83 evenly.
3 does not divide 83 evenly.
4 does not divide 83 evenly.
5 does not divide 83 evenly.
6 does not divide 83 evenly.
7 does not divide 83 evenly.
8 does not divide 83 evenly.
9 does not divide 83 evenly.

Therefore, the only factor pairs of 83 are 1 and 83.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Start with 1 and 91 as the first pair of factors.
2. Check if 91 is divisible by 2. Since it's not, move to the next number.
3. Check if 91 is divisible by 3. Since it's not, move to the next number.
4. Check if 91 is divisible by 4. Since it's not, move to the next number.
5. Check if 91 is divisible by 5. Since it's not, move to the next number.
6. Check if 91 is divisible by 6. Since it's not, move to the next number.
7. Check if 91 is divisible by 7. Yes, 91 Ã· 7 = 13. So, we have the factor pair (7, 13).
8. Continue this process until we reach the square root of 91, which is approximately 9.54.

The factor pairs of 6 are:

These are the only two factor pairs of 6 because no other pairs of numbers multiply together to give 6.

Therefore, the factor pairs of 6 are:

Here are the steps:
1) Start with 1 and 58 as the first pair.

3) Continue this process until the two numbers in the pair are equal.

The factor pairs of 58 are:

Since 58 is an even number, we can stop here because the remaining factors will be the same pairs in reverse order (29, 2 and 58, 1).

Therefore, the factor pairs of 58 are:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find all factor pairs of 89, we need to find all the numbers that divide into 89 evenly, along with their corresponding pairs.

The factors of 89 are:
1 and 89
89 and 1

Now, we need to find the remaining factor pairs by dividing 89 by each number from 2 to the square root of 89 (which is approximately 9.43) and checking if the division is exact (i.e., the remainder is zero).

2 goes into 89, 44 times with a remainder of 1, so 2 is not a factor.
3 goes into 89, 29 times with a remainder of 2, so 3 is not a factor.
4 goes into 89, 22 times with a remainder of 1, so 4 is not a factor.
5 goes into 89, 17 times with a remainder of 4, so 5 is not a factor.
6 goes into 89, 14 times with a remainder of 5, so 6 is not a factor.
7 goes into 89, 12 times with a remainder of 5, so 7 is not a factor.
8 goes into 89, 11 times with a remainder of 1, so 8 is not a factor.
9 goes into 89, 9 times with a remainder of 8, so 9 is not a factor.

Therefore, the only factor pairs of 89 are:
1 and 89
89 and 1

For 30, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with 1 and 30 as the first pair of factors.
2. Divide 30 by 2 to get 15. Now we have two pairs of factors: (1, 30) and (2, 15).
3. Divide 15 by 3 to get 5. Now we have three pairs of factors: (1, 30), (2, 15), and (3, 10).
4. Divide 10 by 2 to get 5. Now we have four pairs of factors: (1, 30), (2, 15), (3, 10), and (5, 6).

Since 6 is the square root of 30, we have found all the factor pairs.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find all the factor pairs of a number, we need to find all the pairs of numbers that multiply together to give that number.

Here are the steps to find the factor pairs of 38:

1. List out all the factors of 38:
   Factors of 38 = 1, 2, 19, 38

2. Pair up the factors such that their product is 38:
   Factor pairs of 38 = (1, 38), (2, 19)

Therefore, the factor pairs of 38 are:
(1, 38) and (2, 19)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the distinct pairs of factors of 93, we need to find all the pairs of numbers that multiply to give 93.

First, let's list out all the factors of 93:
1, 3, 31, 93

Now, we can pair up these factors to form distinct pairs:

1 Ã— 93
3 Ã— 31

Note that we don't need to include the pair 93 Ã— 1 since it's the same as 1 Ã— 93.

Therefore, the distinct pairs of factors that can multiply to give the number 93 are:
1 Ã— 93
3 Ã— 31
