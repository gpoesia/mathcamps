Given information:
- Maria was driving at an average speed of 11.0 miles per hour.
- Maria drove for 6.7 hours in the first stretch.
- Maria drove for an additional 4.3 miles in the second stretch.

Step 1: Find the distance Maria covered in the first stretch.
Distance = Speed Ã— Time
Distance = 11.0 miles per hour Ã— 6.7 hours
Distance = 73.7 miles

Step 2: Find the total distance Maria covered by adding the distances from both stretches.
Total distance = Distance in the first stretch + Distance in the second stretch

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the length and width of the garden after the extension, and then calculate the area using the formula: Area = length Ã— width.

Given information:
- The original garden is 3 meters wide.
- Eva extends the garden by 22.6 meters.
- After the extension, the length of the garden is equal to the width of the original garden times the total length after the extension.

Step 1: Find the total length of the garden after the extension.
Let the total length after the extension be x meters.
According to the given condition, x = 3 Ã— x (since the length is equal to the width of the original garden times the total length after the extension).
x = 3x
x - 3x = 0
-2x = 0
x = 0

Since the length cannot be zero, we need to consider the original width (3 meters) and the extension (22.6 meters).
Total length after the extension = Original width + Extension
Total length after the extension = 3 meters + 22.6 meters = 25.6 meters

Step 2: Find the width of the garden after the extension.
Width after the extension = Original width = 3 meters

Step 3: Calculate the area of the garden after the extension.
Area = Length Ã— Width
Area = 25.6 meters Ã— 3 meters
Area = 76.8 square meters

Therefore, the total area of Eva's garden after the extension is 76.8 square meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the length and width of the garden after the extension, and then calculate the area using the formula: Area = length Ã— width.

Given information:
- The original garden is 16 meters wide.
- Eva extends the garden by 22.6 meters.
- After the extension, the length of the garden is equal to the width of the original garden times the total length after the extension.

Step 1: Find the total length of the garden after the extension.
Let the total length after the extension be x meters.
According to the given condition, x = 16 Ã— x (since the length is equal to the width of the original garden times the total length after the extension).
x = 16x
x - 16x = 0
-15x = 0
x = 0

Since the length cannot be zero, we need to consider the original width (16 meters) and the extension (22.6 meters).
Total length after the extension = Original width + Extension
Total length after the extension = 16 meters + 22.6 meters = 38.6 meters

Step 2: Find the width of the garden after the extension.
Width after the extension = Original width = 16 meters

Step 3: Calculate the area of the garden after the extension.
Area = Length Ã— Width
Area = 38.6 meters Ã— 16 meters
Area = 617.6 square meters

Therefore, the total area of Eva's garden after the extension is 617.6 square meters.

Given information:
- Salary earned for 1 hour of work = $13
- Individual donations = $7

Step 1: Find the total amount of money you have after receiving your salary.
Total amount = Salary earned
Total amount = $13

Step 2: Subtract the individual donations from the total amount.
Amount remaining after subtracting donations = Total amount - Individual donations
Amount remaining after subtracting donations = $13 - $7
Amount remaining after subtracting donations = $6

Therefore, after receiving your salary of $13 and subtracting the individual donations of $7, you will have $6 remaining.

Given:
- The vehicle travels 367.8 miles on a full tank of gas.
- The full tank now holds 20 gallons of gas (instead of 15 gallons).

To find the miles per gallon, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the number of gallons in the full tank.

Miles per gallon = Total distance traveled / Number of gallons in the full tank
Miles per gallon = 367.8 miles / 20 gallons

Given:
- The drone flies at a constant speed of 7.8 km per hour.
- The drone flies for 24 hours without stopping.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in 24 hours.
Distance traveled in 24 hours = Speed Ã— Time
Distance traveled in 24 hours = 7.8 km/hour Ã— 24 hours
Distance traveled in 24 hours = 187.2 km

Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled by adding the additional 31 km.
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled in 24 hours + Additional distance
Total distance traveled = 187.2 km + 31 km

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate the total amount of money Emily has with the corrected allowance amount.

Given information:
- Emily saved $9.12 from doing household chores.
- Emily's mother gave her $47.00 as a monthly allowance (corrected amount).

Step 1: Add the amount saved from household chores and the corrected monthly allowance.
Amount saved from household chores + Corrected monthly allowance = Total amount of money Emily has
$9.12 + $47.00 = $56.12

Therefore, with the corrected allowance amount of $47.00, Emily now has a total of $56.12.

Given information:
- James had $24.31 in his wallet.

Step 1: Find the amount of the gift from his grandmother.

* Harrison originally had $43 in his bank account
* He received a cash gift from his relatives
* The cash gift amount is $38.32 more than the original amount he had ($43)
* His grandmother did not give him an extra $43

To find the new amount in his account, we need to:
1. Calculate the amount of the cash gift from his relatives
2. Add the cash gift amount to his original $43

Step 1: Calculate the cash gift amount
Cash gift amount = Original amount ($43) + $38.32
Cash gift amount = $43 + $38.32
Cash gift amount = $81.32

Step 2: Calculate the new amount in his account
New amount = Original amount + Cash gift amount
New amount = $43 + $81.32
New amount = $124.32

Total amount to save = $984.4

Step 2: Find the amount of money David needs to save in addition to his initial $28.
Additional amount to save = Total amount to save - Initial amount
Additional amount to save = $984.4 - $28
Additional amount to save = $956.4

Step 3: Find the amount of money David should save each week.
Amount to save each week = Additional amount to save / Number of weeks
Amount to save each week = $956.4 / 23

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Zara would save after 17 weeks with her adjusted saving plan of $22 per week.

Given information:
- Zara planned to save $22 every week.
- Zara saved money for 17 weeks.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Zara saved in one week with the adjusted plan.
Amount saved in one week = $22

Step 2: Find the total amount of money Zara saved in 17 weeks with the adjusted plan.
Total amount saved = Amount saved in one week Ã— Number of weeks
Total amount saved = $22 Ã— 17

Given information:
- Samuel has a total of 176 liters of paint.
- He wants to distribute the paint evenly into 8 barrels.

Step 1: Find the amount of paint in each barrel by dividing the total amount of paint by the number of barrels.
Amount of paint in each barrel = Total amount of paint / Number of barrels
Amount of paint in each barrel = 176 liters / 8 barrels
Amount of paint in each barrel = 22 liters

Therefore, when Samuel distributes the 176 liters of paint evenly into 8 barrels, there will be 22 liters of paint in each barrel.

Now, we need to find the total amount of paint required to fill 43 barrels with the same quantity of paint as before.

Given information:
- Each barrel contains 22 liters of paint.
- Samuel wants to fill 43 barrels.

Step 1: Find the total amount of paint required by multiplying the number of barrels by the amount of paint in each barrel.
Total amount of paint required = Number of barrels Ã— Amount of paint in each barrel
Total amount of paint required = 43 barrels Ã— 22 liters
Total amount of paint required = 946 liters

Therefore, if Samuel decides to fill 43 barrels with the same quantity of paint as before, he will need a total of 946 liters of paint.

Given information:
- Samuel has a total of 176 liters of paint.
- He wants to distribute the paint evenly into 29 barrels.

Step 1: Find the amount of paint in each barrel by dividing the total amount of paint by the number of barrels.
Amount of paint in each barrel = Total amount of paint / Number of barrels
Amount of paint in each barrel = 176 liters / 29 barrels
Amount of paint in each barrel = 6.0689... liters

Since we cannot have a fractional amount of liters in each barrel, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Amount of paint in each barrel = 6 liters

Therefore, if Samuel distributes the 176 liters of paint evenly into 29 barrels, there will be 6 liters of paint in each barrel.

Given information:
- Mark bought 29 shirts.
- Each shirt costs $17.
- He got a $1 discount on the total cost.

Step 1: Find the total cost of the shirts without the discount.
Total cost without discount = Number of shirts Ã— Cost per shirt
Total cost without discount = 29 Ã— $17
Total cost without discount = $493

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the total cost without discount.
Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount
Total cost with discount = $493 - $1
Total cost with discount = $492

- He bought a tie that cost $6.62.

Step 1: Find the total cost by adding the cost of the tie to the cost of the shirts.
Total cost = Cost of the shirts + Cost of the tie
Total cost = $492 + $6.62
Total cost = $498.62

- Each shirt costs $17.
- He got a $1 discount on the total cost.

Step 1: Find the total cost of the shirts without the discount.
Total cost without discount = Number of shirts Ã— Cost per shirt
Total cost without discount = 39 Ã— $17
Total cost without discount = $663

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the total cost without discount.
Total cost with discount = Total cost without discount - Discount
Total cost with discount = $663 - $1
Total cost with discount = $662

- Sarah also bought a board game that costs $30.30.

Step 1: Calculate the final total cost by adding the cost of the board game to the initial total cost.
Final total cost = Initial total cost + Cost of the board game
Final total cost = $260.91 + $30.30 = $291.21

Step 1: Find the total amount of money Susan has after adding the money she found in her desk drawer to the money in her purse.
Money in her purse + Money found in desk drawer = Total money after adding the found money
$11 + $6 = $17

Step 2: Find the total amount of money Susan has after adding the money she earned from doing chores.
Total money after adding the found money + Money earned from chores = Total money Susan has now
$17 + $23 = $40

Therefore, with the revised information, Susan has $40 now.

Given information:
- Susan has $46 in her wallet initially.
- Susan spends $45 on a new toy robot.

Step 1: Subtract the amount spent on the toy robot from the initial amount in her wallet.
Amount of money left = Initial amount - Amount spent
Amount of money left = $46 - $45
Amount of money left = $1

Therefore, after spending $45 on the new toy robot, Susan has $1 left in her wallet.

Given information:
- Susan initially had $46 in her wallet.
- After spending $45 on a toy robot, she had $1 left.
- Susan's mother gave her the same amount as she initially had ($46).

Step 1: Find the amount of money Susan had after spending $45 on the toy robot.
Amount of money left after spending $45 = $46 - $45 = $1

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Susan has after receiving the additional money from her mother.
Total amount of money = Amount of money left + Additional money received from her mother
Total amount of money = $1 + $46
Total amount of money = $47

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate with the new information.

Given information:
- Sarah had $38.45 in her savings account initially.
- She added $31 to her savings account (instead of $39).
- She received a gift of $44.5.

Step 1: Add the initial amount and the additional amount she added.
Initial amount + Additional amount = $38.45 + $31 = $69.45

Step 2: Add the gift amount to the result from Step 1.
Total amount = Amount from Step 1 + Gift amount
Total amount = $69.45 + $44.5 = $113.95

Therefore, with the updated information, Sarah now has a total of $113.95 in her savings account.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of gas consumption per hour and then multiply it by the given time of 30 hours.

Given information:
- The car consumes 615 liters of gas every 41 hours.

Step 1: Find the rate of gas consumption per hour.
Rate of gas consumption per hour = Total gas consumption / Total time
Rate of gas consumption per hour = 615 liters / 41 hours
Rate of gas consumption per hour = 15 liters per hour

Step 2: Calculate the gas consumption in 30 hours.
Gas consumption in 30 hours = Rate of gas consumption per hour Ã— Time in hours
Gas consumption in 30 hours = 15 liters per hour Ã— 30 hours
Gas consumption in 30 hours = 450 liters

Therefore, the car will consume 450 liters of gas in 30 hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of gas consumed in 30 hours and then subtract the amount of gas lost due to the leak.

Given information:
- The car consumes 615 liters of gas every 41 hours.
- The car has consumed gas for 30 hours.
- The car lost 46.33 liters of gas due to a leak.

Step 1: Find the amount of gas consumed in 30 hours.
Rate of gas consumption per hour = 615 liters / 41 hours = 15 liters per hour
Gas consumption in 30 hours = Rate of gas consumption per hour Ã— Time in hours
Gas consumption in 30 hours = 15 liters per hour Ã— 30 hours = 450 liters

Step 2: Subtract the amount of gas lost due to the leak from the gas consumed in 30 hours.
Gas remaining in the car = Gas consumption in 30 hours - Gas lost due to the leak
Gas remaining in the car = 450 liters - 46.33 liters
Gas remaining in the car = 403.67 liters

Therefore, 403.67 liters of gas remain in the car after consuming gas for 30 hours and losing 46.33 liters due to a leak.

Given information:
- The car consumes 615 liters of gas every 23 hours.

Step 1: Find the new rate of gas consumption per hour.
New rate of gas consumption per hour = Total gas consumption / Total time
New rate of gas consumption per hour = 615 liters / 23 hours
New rate of gas consumption per hour = 26.74 liters per hour (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Calculate the gas consumption in 30 hours with the new rate.
Gas consumption in 30 hours = New rate of gas consumption per hour Ã— Time in hours
Gas consumption in 30 hours = 26.74 liters per hour Ã— 30 hours
Gas consumption in 30 hours = 802.2 liters

Given information:
- Emma had $38 in her wallet initially.
- After buying the book, she had $32.6 left.

Step 1: Subtract the amount of money left after buying the book from the initial amount of money.
Cost of the book = Initial amount of money - Amount of money left after buying the book
Cost of the book = $38 - $32.6

Given information:
- Stacey spent $20 on books.
- Stacey spent $35 on school supplies.

Step 1: Find Stacey's total earlier expenses.
Total earlier expenses = Cost of books + Cost of school supplies
Total earlier expenses = $20 + $35 = $55

Step 2: Find the cost of the backpack.
Cost of the backpack = Total earlier expenses + $41
Cost of the backpack = $55 + $41 = $96

Step 3: Find the total amount of money Stacey spent.
Total amount spent = Total earlier expenses + Cost of the backpack
Total amount spent = $55 + $96 = $151

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's look at the information we have:
* Joe had $42.9 initially
* He spent $34, leaving him with $8.9
* The toy costs $35.44

To find how much more money Joe needs, we need to subtract the amount he has left ($8.9) from the cost of the toy ($35.44).

Cost of the toy - Amount Joe has left = Amount more needed
$35.44 - $8.9 = $26.54

Therefore, Joe needs $26.54 more to buy the toy.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem.

Given information:
- Joe originally had $43 in his wallet.
- Joe spent $34.

To find the amount of money Joe has left in his wallet, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the initial amount he had.

Step 1: Subtract the amount spent from the initial amount.
Amount left in Joe's wallet = Initial amount - Amount spent
Amount left in Joe's wallet = $43 - $34
Amount left in Joe's wallet = $9

Therefore, if Joe originally had $43 in his wallet and spent $34, he would have $9 left in his wallet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the monthly installment for the car payment and then add the car insurance cost to it.

Given information:
- Cost of the car = $303.5756
- Number of monthly installments = 19.51
- Car insurance cost = $41.35

Step 1: Find the monthly installment for the car payment.
Monthly installment for the car = Cost of the car / Number of monthly installments
Monthly installment for the car = $303.5756 / 19.51
Monthly installment for the car = $15.55 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Calculate the total monthly payment for the car and insurance.
Total monthly payment = Monthly installment for the car + Car insurance cost
Total monthly payment = $15.55 + $41.35
Total monthly payment = $56.90

Therefore, your total monthly payment for your car and insurance is $56.90.

Given information:
- Cost of the car = $41

- Car insurance cost = $41.35

Step 1: Find the monthly installment for the car payment.
Monthly installment for the car = Cost of the car / Number of monthly installments
Monthly installment for the car = $41 / 19.51
Monthly installment for the car = $2.10 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Calculate the total monthly payment for the car and insurance.
Total monthly payment = Monthly installment for the car + Car insurance cost
Total monthly payment = $2.10 + $41.35
Total monthly payment = $43.45

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate with the updated information.

Given information:
- John originally had $32 in his wallet.
- He bought a new book that cost $18.

Step 1: Subtract the cost of the book from the initial amount of money in John's wallet.
Amount of money left = Initial amount of money - Cost of the book
Amount of money left = $32 - $18
Amount of money left = $14

Therefore, after buying the new book that cost $18, John has $14 left in his wallet.

Step 1: Find the total cost before applying the discount coupon.
Total cost before discount = Cost of one bottle Ã— Number of bottles
Total cost before discount = $16.01 Ã— 17
Total cost before discount = $272.17

Step 2: Apply the discount coupon to the total cost.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given information:
- John initially had $31 in his savings account.
- John's mom gives him an additional $3 after doing chores.

To find the total amount of money John has in his savings account, we need to add the initial amount to the additional amount given by his mom.

Step 1: Add the initial amount to the additional amount.
John's initial savings + Additional money from mom = Total amount in savings account
$31 + $3 = $34

Therefore, after receiving the additional $3 from his mom, John now has $34 in his savings account.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money John has in his wallet after adding the found money and the money from the envelope, and then calculate the cost of the 17 vintage comic books.

Given information:
- John initially has $19 in his wallet.
- He finds $5 on the street and adds it to his wallet.
- He discovers an envelope with $27.97 and adds it to his wallet.
- He buys 17 vintage comic books, each costing the total amount he currently has in his wallet.

Step 1: Find the total amount of money John has in his wallet after adding the found money and the money from the envelope.
Initial amount in wallet = $19
Found money = $5
Money from envelope = $27.97
Total amount in wallet = $19 + $5 + $27.97 = $51.97

Step 2: Calculate the cost of each vintage comic book.
Cost of each comic book = Total amount in wallet / 17 comic books
Cost of each comic book = $51.97 / 17 = $3.06

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 17 vintage comic books.
Total cost = Cost of each comic book Ã— Number of comic books
Total cost = $3.06 Ã— 17 = $52.02

Therefore, John spends a total of $52.02 on the 17 vintage comic books.

Given information:
- John initially has $35.6 in his wallet.
- He spends $32 to buy a chocolate bar.
- He receives $46.3 from his friend.
- His grandmother gives him an additional $12.9.

Step 1: Calculate John's wallet balance after buying the chocolate bar.
Initial balance - Cost of chocolate bar = New balance
$35.6 - $32 = $3.6

Step 2: Calculate John's wallet balance after receiving money from his friend.
New balance + Money received from friend = Updated balance
$3.6 + $46.3 = $49.9

Step 3: Calculate John's final wallet balance after receiving money from his grandmother.

Given information:
- John initially has $35.6 in his wallet.

- His grandmother gives him an additional $12.9.

Step 1: Calculate John's wallet balance after buying the item.

43 hours = 43 Ã— 60 minutes = 2,580 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled using the formula: Distance = Speed Ã— Time
Distance = 6.4 miles/hour Ã— (2,580 minutes / 60 minutes/hour)

* Each movie ticket originally cost $18.49
* For each ticket, Joseph bought a VIP experience that costs $14.30 extra

To find the new cost of each movie ticket including the VIP experience, we need to add the original cost and the VIP experience cost.

Original cost of one movie ticket: $18.49
Cost of VIP experience for one ticket: $14.30

New cost of one movie ticket with VIP experience:
= Original cost + VIP experience cost

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the fruits and then add the cost of the snacks.

Given information:
- The customer bought 34.2 pounds of fruits.
- The cost of each pound of fruits is $11.01.
- The customer spent an extra $7 on snacks.

Step 1: Find the cost of the fruits.
Cost of fruits = Cost per pound Ã— Number of pounds
Cost of fruits = $11.01 Ã— 34.2 pounds
Cost of fruits = $376.14

Step 2: Find the total cost by adding the cost of fruits and the cost of snacks.
Total cost = Cost of fruits + Cost of snacks
Total cost = $376.14 + $7
Total cost = $383.14

Therefore, the customer spent a total of $383.14 on fruits and snacks.

- The car travels for 3.6 hours, covering a distance of 172.8 km.
- After traveling for 3.6 hours, the car continues to travel for another 30.0 km.

To find the total distance traveled, we need to add the distance covered in the first 3.6 hours and the additional distance traveled.

Distance covered in the first 3.6 hours = 172.8 km
Additional distance traveled = 30.0 km

Total distance traveled = Distance covered in the first 3.6 hours + Additional distance traveled
Total distance traveled = 172.8 km + 30.0 km
Total distance traveled = 202.8 km

Given information:
- The cyclist pedaled for a total of 50.0 kilometers.
- Before taking a break, the cyclist had covered 38.4 kilometers.

Step 1: Find the distance the cyclist pedaled after resuming from the break.
Total distance pedaled - Distance pedaled before the break = Distance pedaled after the break
50.0 kilometers - 38.4 kilometers = Distance pedaled after the break

Distance pedaled after the break = 50.0 kilometers - 38.4 kilometers
Distance pedaled after the break = 11.6 kilometers

Therefore, the cyclist pedaled 11.6 kilometers after resuming from the break.

Given information:
- The cyclist repeats the same cycle for 7 days.
- The distance pedaled after resuming from the break is 11.6 kilometers per day.

To find the total distance covered after resuming from the break over 7 days, we need to multiply the daily distance by the number of days.

Total distance covered after resuming from the break = Distance pedaled after the break per day Ã— Number of days
Total distance covered after resuming from the break = 11.6 kilometers Ã— 7 days
Total distance covered after resuming from the break = 81.2 kilometers

Therefore, the cyclist covers a total distance of 81.2 kilometers after resuming from the break over 7 days.

- The cyclist pedals for a total of 50.0 kilometers each day.
- The cyclist takes a break after covering 40 kilometers.

Step 1: Find the distance the cyclist pedals after resuming from the break each day.
Total distance pedaled - Distance pedaled before the break = Distance pedaled after the break
50.0 kilometers - 40 kilometers = Distance pedaled after the break

Distance pedaled after the break = 50.0 kilometers - 40 kilometers
Distance pedaled after the break = 10 kilometers

Therefore, the cyclist pedals 10 kilometers after resuming from the break each day.

Given information:
- Mia had $35 saved from her birthday (instead of $41).
- Mia earned an additional $24.7 from babysitting.

Step 1: Add the amount saved from her birthday and the amount earned from babysitting.
Amount saved from birthday + Amount earned from babysitting = Total amount of money
$35 + $24.7 = $59.7

Therefore, with the updated amount of $35 saved from her birthday and the $24.7 earned from babysitting, Mia now has a total of $59.7.

Given information:
- Mandy saved $29.7 from her part-time job.
- Mandy's father gave her an additional $12.6.

Step 1: Add the two amounts together.
Mandy's total money = Money saved from part-time job + Money given by father
Mandy's total money = $29.7 + $12.6
Mandy's total money = $42.3

Therefore, Mandy has a total of $42.3 now.

Given information:
- Mandy had a total of $42.3 before buying the book.
- The cost of the book is $19.79.

Step 1: Subtract the cost of the book from Mandy's total money.
Money left after buying the book = Mandy's total money - Cost of the book
Money left after buying the book = $42.3 - $19.79
Money left after buying the book = $22.51

Given information:
- The bakery makes 10 loaves of bread every hour.

Step 1: Find the number of loaves of bread made per hour.
Number of loaves of bread made per hour = 10 loaves

Step 2: Find the total number of loaves of bread made in 36 hours.
Total number of loaves of bread made = Number of loaves of bread made per hour Ã— Number of hours the oven is working
Total number of loaves of bread made = 10 loaves Ã— 36 hours
Total number of loaves of bread made = 360 loaves

Therefore, the bakery makes 360 loaves of bread when the oven is working continuously for 36 hours.

Step 1: Find the total number of loaves of bread made.
Total number of loaves of bread made = 360 loaves

Step 2: Find the number of loaves of bread left after donating 45 loaves.
Number of loaves of bread left = Total number of loaves of bread made - Number of loaves donated
Number of loaves of bread left = 360 loaves - 45 loaves

Step 1: Find the number of loaves of bread made per hour with the increased efficiency.
Number of loaves of bread made per hour = 21 loaves

Step 2: Find the total number of loaves of bread made in 36 hours with the increased efficiency.
Total number of loaves of bread made = Number of loaves of bread made per hour Ã— Number of hours the oven is working

- John's grandmother gave him $38.9 for his birthday.

Step 1: Find the total amount of money John has after receiving the birthday gift.
John's total money = Money in piggy bank + Money received from grandmother
John's total money = $30.02 + $38.9
John's total money = $68.92

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money John will have if he saves up six times the amount he has now.
Amount of money after saving six times = John's total money Ã— 7
Amount of money after saving six times = $68.92 Ã— 7

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's look at the new scenario:

Given information:
- You have already finished a 23.0-kilometer route.
- Instead of adding 17.2 kilometers, you have a longer route of 48 kilometers.

To find the total travel distance, we need to add the distance you have already traveled (23.0 kilometers) and the longer route distance (48 kilometers).

Step 1: Add the two distances.
Distance already traveled + Longer route distance = Total travel distance
23.0 kilometers + 48 kilometers = 71.0 kilometers

Therefore, if you had a longer route of 48 kilometers before adding it to your already traveled distance of 23 kilometers, your total travel distance would have been 71.0 kilometers.

Given information:
- Bob's speed = 8.0 miles per hour

Given:
- The train travels at a speed of 47.1 miles per hour.
- The train travels for 8 hours.
- The detour reduces the total distance traveled by 21.2 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled before the detour.
Distance before the detour = Speed Ã— Time
Distance before the detour = 47.1 miles per hour Ã— 8 hours
Distance before the detour = 376.8 miles

Step 2: Calculate the final distance traveled after the detour.
Final distance traveled = Distance before the detour - Reduction in distance due to the detour
Final distance traveled = 376.8 miles - 21.2 miles

- Each book cost the same amount as the money he had in his wallet.

Let's assume that the amount of money John had in his wallet is x.

Since each book cost the same amount as the money he had in his wallet, the cost of one book is also x.

To find the total cost of 8 books, we need to multiply the cost of one book by the number of books.

Total cost of 8 books = Cost of one book Ã— Number of books
Total cost of 8 books = x Ã— 8

1. Find the total amount of money Jenny had after receiving the birthday money.
2. Subtract the amount she spent on the book from the total amount.

Given information:
- Jenny had $48.6 in her savings account.
- She received $26 on her birthday.
- She spent $22 on a new book.

Step 1: Find the total amount of money Jenny had after receiving the birthday money.
Initial amount + Birthday money = Total amount
$48.6 + $26 = $74.6

Step 2: Subtract the amount she spent on the book from the total amount.
Total amount - Amount spent on the book = Amount remaining in the savings account
$74.6 - $22 = $52.6

- The car's gas tank indicates that an additional 41 miles can be covered before the gas runs out.

Step 1: Find the distance already traveled.
Distance already traveled = Speed Ã— Time

Total amount = $23.7 + $7.56 = $31.26

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the snack from the total amount
Total amount: $31.26

To find out how much more money Jerry needs to buy the book, we need to subtract the amount he has from the cost of the book.

Cost of the book: $36
Amount Jerry has: $26.76

Amount needed = Cost of the book - Amount Jerry has

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the clothing Jake bought and add the cost of the hat.

Given information:
- The price of each shirt is $33.
- Jake bought 2.4 times the amount of clothing.
- The cost of the hat is $19.53.

Step 1: Find the cost of the clothing Jake bought.
Cost of one shirt = $33
Total cost of clothing = Cost of one shirt Ã— 2.4
Total cost of clothing = $33 Ã— 2.4
Total cost of clothing = $79.20

Step 2: Find the total cost by adding the cost of the hat.
Total cost = Total cost of clothing + Cost of the hat
Total cost = $79.20 + $19.53
Total cost = $98.73

Therefore, Jake spent a total of $98.73 at the boutique for the clothing and the hat.

- Her grandmother gifted her $36.0.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Sarah has after adding the money from her neighbor to her initial savings.
Initial savings + Money from neighbor = Amount after adding money from neighbor

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the amount of money Mason had saved up from his previous week's allowance, the extra money he earned by doing extra house chores this week, and the gift money from his grandma.

Given information:
- Mason had saved up $34 from his previous week's allowance.
- Mason earned an extra $31.4 by doing some extra house chores this week.
- Mason's grandma gave him another $27.4 as a gift.

Step 1: Add the amount of money Mason had saved up, the extra money he earned, and the gift money from his grandma.
Amount of money Mason had saved up + Extra money earned + Gift money from grandma = Total money Mason has now
$34 + $31.4 + $27.4 = $92.8

Therefore, Mason has a total of $92.8 now.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to subtract the amount of money Rachel spent on the new toy from the initial amount of money she had.

Given information:
- Rachel had $48.
- Rachel spent $5.5 on a new toy.

Step 1: Subtract the amount spent on the new toy from the initial amount of money Rachel had.
Initial amount of money - Amount spent on the new toy = Amount of money left
$48 - $5.5 = $42.5

Therefore, Rachel has $42.5 left after buying the new toy.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the additional amount of money Rachel's mom gave her to the amount of money she had left after her purchase.

Given information:
- Rachel had $42.5 left after her purchase.

Step 1: Add the additional amount of money to the amount of money Rachel had left.
Amount of money left after purchase + Additional amount of money given = Total amount of money Rachel has now
$42.5 + $23 = $65.5

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step:

Given:
- Rachel initially had $48.
- The toy cost $45 instead of $5.5.

To find the amount of money Rachel would have left after purchasing the toy, we need to subtract the cost of the toy from the initial amount of money she had.

Step 1: Subtract the cost of the toy from the initial amount of money Rachel had.
Initial amount of money - Cost of the toy = Amount of money left
$48 - $45 = $3

Therefore, if the toy cost $45, Rachel would have $3 left after her purchase.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the number of days.

Given information:
- The cyclist travels 506 kilometers in total.
- The cyclist travels for 11 days.

Step 1: Divide the total distance by the number of days.
Distance traveled per day = Total distance / Number of days
Distance traveled per day = 506 kilometers / 11 days
Distance traveled per day = 46 kilometers

Therefore, the cyclist travels 46 kilometers each day.
