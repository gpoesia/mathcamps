        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the result of 1 raised to the power of 2, we need to follow the rules of exponents.

When the base is 1 and the exponent is any positive integer, the result is always 1.

1^2 means 1 Ã— 1 = 1

Therefore, the result of 1 raised to the power of 2 is 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* We have 8 groups of spiders
* Each group has a &quot;power of 2&quot;

The &quot;power of 2&quot; means:
* Group 1 has 2^0 = 1 spider
* Group 2 has 2^1 = 2 spiders
* Group 3 has 2^2 = 4 spiders
* Group 4 has 2^3 = 8 spiders
* Group 5 has 2^4 = 16 spiders
* Group 6 has 2^5 = 32 spiders
* Group 7 has 2^6 = 64 spiders
* Group 8 has 2^7 = 128 spiders

To find the total number of spiders, we sum up the spiders in each group:
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255

Therefore, the result if we have 8 groups of spiders, each group having a power of 2, is 255 spiders.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's consider 6 raised to the power of 2 instead.

To calculate any number raised to the power of 2, we need to multiply that number by itself once.

6 Ã— 6 = 36

Therefore, the result of 6 raised to the power of 2 is 36.

When we raise a number to the power of 2, it means we are multiplying that number by itself once.
