        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the initial number of guests and the additional guests that joined later.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 66 teenagers and 6 adults attending the party.
- Later on, the number of guests increased by 62.
- Near the end, an additional group of 52 people joined the party.

Step 1: Find the initial number of guests.
Initial number of guests = Number of teenagers + Number of adults
Initial number of guests = 66 + 6 = 72 people

Step 2: Find the total number of additional guests.
Total additional guests = Guests who joined later + Additional group near the end
Total additional guests = 62 + 52 = 114 people

Step 3: Find the total number of people who attended the party.
Total number of people = Initial number of guests + Total additional guests
Total number of people = 72 + 114 = 186 people

Therefore, 186 people attended the party in total.

            Following the party, the hosts want to estimate the total attendance for both the party and its pre-party. At the pre-party, the original group of teenagers and adults also attended (66 teenagers and 6 adults). How many people attended both events in total?

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of people who attended both the pre-party and the party.

Given information:
- At the pre-party, there were 66 teenagers and 6 adults (same as the initial group at the party).
- At the party, there were initially 66 teenagers and 6 adults.
- Later on, the number of guests at the party increased by 62.
- Near the end of the party, an additional group of 52 people joined.

Step 1: Find the total number of people who attended the pre-party.
Total people at the pre-party = Number of teenagers + Number of adults
Total people at the pre-party = 66 + 6 = 72 people

Step 2: Find the total number of people who attended the party (from the previous question).
Total people at the party = 186 people

Step 3: Find the total number of people who attended both events.
Total people at both events = Total people at the pre-party + Total people at the party
Total people at both events = 72 + 186 = 258 people

Note: We don't need to subtract the initial group of 66 teenagers and 6 adults from the total, as they attended both events.

Therefore, 258 people attended both the pre-party and the party in total.

Given information:
- Tom initially has 11 hats.
- Tom buys a box of hats that contains 42 more hats.

Step 1: Find the total number of hats Tom has after buying the box of hats.
Total number of hats = Initial number of hats + Number of hats in the box

Given information:
- Tom originally had 8 hats.
- Tom buys a box of hats that contains 42 more hats.

Step 1: Find the total number of hats Tom has after buying the box of hats.
Total number of hats = Initial number of hats + Number of hats in the box
Total number of hats = 8 + 42
Total number of hats = 50

Therefore, if Tom originally had 8 hats and then bought the box of 42 hats, he would now have 50 hats.

Step 1: Find the total number of beach balls by adding the number of beach balls inflated by both participants.
Total number of beach balls = Number of beach balls inflated by the first participant + Number of beach balls added by the second participant

Given:
- Initially, there were 153 beach balls at the beach party.
- The latecomers brought 96 more beach balls.

To find the total number of beach balls after the latecomers added their beach balls, we need to add the initial number of beach balls and the number of beach balls brought by the latecomers.

Step 1: Add the initial number of beach balls and the number of beach balls brought by the latecomers.
Total number of beach balls = Initial number of beach balls + Number of beach balls brought by the latecomers
Total number of beach balls = 153 + 96
Total number of beach balls = 249

Step 1: Find the total number of people after the additional 20 adults arrived.
Total people after 20 adults arrived = Initial adults + Initial children + Additional adults
Total people after 20 adults arrived = 74 + 58 + 20 = 152 people

Step 2: Find the total number of people after the bus with 65 more people arrived.
Total people after the bus arrived = Total people after 20 adults arrived + People from the bus

Step 1: Find the total distance traveled by the boat.
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled west + Distance traveled during the detour + Distance traveled after the detour
Total distance traveled = 43 squids + 25 squids + 33 squids

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we found that the boat had traveled a total of 101 squids from the starting point on the East Coast.

Given information:
- The boat has already traveled 101 squids from the starting point on the East Coast.
- The boat continues its journey and travels for another 83 squids.

To find the total distance traveled from the starting point on the East Coast, we need to add the additional distance traveled to the previous total distance.

Step 1: Calculate the new total distance traveled from the starting point.
New total distance traveled = Previous total distance traveled + Additional distance traveled
New total distance traveled = 101 squids + 83 squids
New total distance traveled = 184 squids

Therefore, after continuing its journey for an additional 83 squids, the boat has traveled a total of 184 squids from the starting point on the East Coast.

            Let's revisit the previous scenario. Suppose that the boat started on the East Coast and initially traveled 43 squids west, then took a detour that was only 25 squids long. But instead of moving an additional 33 squids as before, this time, it only travels another 30 squids. Now, how far, in squids, has the boat traveled from the starting point of the East Coast?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's revisit the scenario with the new information.

Given information:
- The boat starts on the east coast.
- The boat travels 43 squids (miles) west.
- The boat takes a detour for 25 squids.
- The boat travels another 30 squids after the detour.

Step 1: Find the total distance traveled by the boat.
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled west + Distance traveled during the detour + Distance traveled after the detour
Total distance traveled = 43 squids + 25 squids + 30 squids
Total distance traveled = 98 squids

Therefore, the total distance traveled by the boat from the starting point on the east coast is 98 squids.

Given information:
- The total length of fish caught today on the lake was 90 inches.
- On the way back to shore, he caught 14 more inches of fish.
- He caught a total of 56 inches of fish yesterday.
- Before going home, he caught an additional 46 inches of fish from the dock.

Step 1: Find the total length of fish caught today.
Length of fish caught on the lake + Length of fish caught on the way back to shore
Total length of fish caught today = 90 inches + 14 inches = 104 inches

Step 2: Find the total length of fish caught overall.
Total length of fish caught = Total length of fish caught today + Total length of fish caught yesterday + Length of fish caught from the dock
Total length of fish caught = 104 inches + 56 inches + 46 inches = 206 inches

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of beads on the new bracelet.

Given information:
- Jenny starts her day with 29 beads.
- The new bracelet has 73 more beads than she started with.

Step 1: Find the total number of beads Jenny has after getting the new bracelet.
Total number of beads = Initial number of beads + Number of beads on the new bracelet
Total number of beads = 29 + (29 + 73)
Total number of beads = 29 + 102
Total number of beads = 131

Step 2: Find the number of beads on the new bracelet.
Number of beads on the new bracelet = Total number of beads - Initial number of beads
Number of beads on the new bracelet = 131 - 29
Number of beads on the new bracelet = 102

Therefore, the new bracelet has 102 beads.

Given information:
- Whiskers caught 50 mice in a year.
- Velvet caught 89 mice in the same year.

To find the combined number of mice caught by both cats, we need to add the number of mice caught by each cat.

Number of mice caught by Whiskers + Number of mice caught by Velvet = Combined number of mice caught

Substituting the given values:
50 + 89 = 139

Therefore, Whiskers and Velvet caught a combined total of 139 mice in that year.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we found that Whiskers caught 50 mice, and Velvet caught 89 mice, making a combined total of 139 mice caught by both cats.

Now, we are told that Whiskers had a surge in hunting activity and caught an additional amount of mice equal to the combined total previously calculated, which is 139 mice.

To find the total number of mice Whiskers caught by the end of the year, we need to add the initial number of mice caught by Whiskers (50) and the additional number of mice caught during the surge (139).

Total number of mice caught by Whiskers = Initial number of mice caught + Additional number of mice caught during the surge
Total number of mice caught by Whiskers = 50 + 139
Total number of mice caught by Whiskers = 189

Therefore, by the end of the year, Whiskers would have caught a total of 189 mice.

Given information:
- Whiskers caught 4 mice in a year.
- Velvet caught 89 mice in the same year.

To find the combined number of mice caught by both cats, we need to add the number of mice caught by each cat.

Number of mice caught by Whiskers + Number of mice caught by Velvet = Combined number of mice caught

4 + 89 = 93

Therefore, with Whiskers catching 4 mice and Velvet catching 89 mice, they caught a combined total of 93 mice in that year.

Step 1: Find the number of apples Mark's friend gifted him.
Total count after friend's gift = Initial count + 92
Total count after friend's gift = 79 + 92 = 171 apples

Number of apples gifted by friend = Total count after friend's gift - Initial count

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to understand that wind speed is a scalar quantity, which means it has a magnitude but no specific direction associated with it.

Given information:
- The wind speed measured at one location was 93 miles per hour.
- The wind speed measured at another location was exactly the same, which is also 93 miles per hour.

To find the combined wind speed at the two locations, we simply need to add the individual wind speeds together.

Combined wind speed = Wind speed at location 1 + Wind speed at location 2
Combined wind speed = 93 miles per hour + 93 miles per hour
Combined wind speed = 186 miles per hour

Given information:
- The wind speed at the first location was 93 miles per hour.
- The wind speed at the second location was also 93 miles per hour.
- The wind speed at a third location was also 93 miles per hour.

To find the total wind speed recorded across all three locations, we need to add the individual wind speeds together.

Total wind speed = Wind speed at location 1 + Wind speed at location 2 + Wind speed at location 3
Total wind speed = 93 miles per hour + 93 miles per hour + 93 miles per hour
Total wind speed = 279 miles per hour

Therefore, the total wind speed recorded across all three locations is 279 miles per hour.

Given information:
- The wind speed measured at one location was 99 miles per hour.
- The wind speed measured at another location was also 99 miles per hour.

To find the combined wind speed at the two locations, we need to add the individual wind speeds together, just like in the previous problem.

Combined wind speed = Wind speed at location 1 + Wind speed at location 2
Combined wind speed = 99 miles per hour + 99 miles per hour
Combined wind speed = 198 miles per hour

- Initially, the robot travels 10 meters.
- After running the updated programming command, it travels 26 meters more than it originally did.

Step 1: Find the distance the robot travels after running the updated programming command.
Distance traveled after the updated programming command = Initial distance + Additional distance
Distance traveled after the updated programming command = 10 meters + (10 meters + 26 meters)
Distance traveled after the updated programming command = 10 meters + 36 meters
Distance traveled after the updated programming command = 46 meters

Total pieces of cheese = 26 + 4
Total pieces of cheese = 30

Therefore, if Jeremy bought 26 pieces of cheese from the cheese shop and 4 more pieces from the market, he would have a total of 30 pieces of cheese.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of magic jewels in the treasure chest after the magical charm is used.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 84 magic jewels in the treasure chest.
- When the magical charm is used, 83 more magic jewels appear in the chest.

Step 1: Find the number of magic jewels after using the magical charm.
Number of magic jewels after using the charm = Initial number of magic jewels + Number of magic jewels added by the charm
Number of magic jewels after using the charm = 84 + 83
Number of magic jewels after using the charm = 167

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given:
- Initially, there were 84 magic jewels in the treasure chest.
- After using the charm the first time, 83 more magic jewels appeared, making the total 84 + 83 = 167 magic jewels.
- After using the charm the second time, 72 more magic jewels appeared.

To find the total number of magic jewels after using the charm the second time, we need to add the 72 new magic jewels to the existing total.

Step 1: Find the total number of magic jewels after using the charm the first time.
Total magic jewels after using the charm the first time = 167

Step 2: Find the total number of magic jewels after using the charm the second time.
Total magic jewels after using the charm the second time = Total magic jewels after using the charm the first time + Number of magic jewels added by using the charm the second time
Total magic jewels after using the charm the second time = 167 + 72
Total magic jewels after using the charm the second time = 239

Therefore, there are now 239 magic jewels in the treasure chest.

Given information:
- There were 157 rings in the second display case initially.
- A new batch of 84 rings is added to the second display case.

To find the new total number of rings in the second display case, we need to add the number of rings already present in the second display case and the number of rings in the new batch.

Step 1: Calculate the new total number of rings in the second display case.
New total number of rings in the second display case = Number of rings already present + Number of rings in the new batch
New total number of rings in the second display case = 157 + 84
New total number of rings in the second display case = 241

Therefore, after adding the new batch of 84 rings, the new total number of rings in the second display case is 241.

Number of rings in the second display case = 43 + Number of rings in the first display case
Number of rings in the second display case = 43 + 98
Number of rings in the second display case = 141

- The shopkeeper adds 32 more erasers to the inventory.
- A student donates another 24 erasers to the school shop.

Step 1: Find the total number of erasers after adding the new erasers from the shopkeeper.
Total number of erasers after the shopkeeper's addition = Initial number of erasers + Number of erasers added by the shopkeeper
Total number of erasers after the shopkeeper's addition = 74 + 32 = 106

Step 2: Find the total number of erasers after adding the erasers donated by the student.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cameras Michael has after adding the new cameras he won at the auction to his initial collection.

Given information:
- Michael initially had 97 cameras in his collection.
- He won an auction and added 65 more cameras to his collection.

To find the total number of cameras, we need to add the initial number of cameras and the number of cameras he won at the auction.

Total number of cameras = Initial number of cameras + Number of cameras won at the auction
Total number of cameras = 97 + 65
Total number of cameras = 162

Therefore, after winning the auction and adding 65 new cameras to his collection, Michael now has 162 cameras in his collection.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given:
- Initially, Michael had 97 cameras in his collection.
- He won an auction and added 65 more cameras to his collection.
- After the auction, he received a gift of 82 more cameras from a friend.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cameras after winning the auction.
Number of cameras after the auction = Initial number of cameras + Cameras won at the auction
Number of cameras after the auction = 97 + 65 = 162

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cameras after receiving the gift.
Total number of cameras = Number of cameras after the auction + Cameras received as a gift
Total number of cameras = 162 + 82 = 244

Therefore, after receiving the gift of 82 more cameras from his friend, Michael now has a total of 244 cameras in his collection.

Given information:
- Michael originally had 35 cameras in his collection (instead of 97).
- He won an auction and added 65 more cameras to his collection.

To find the total number of cameras after adding the new cameras, we need to add the initial number of cameras and the number of cameras won at the auction.

Total number of cameras = Initial number of cameras + Number of cameras won at the auction
Total number of cameras = 35 + 65
Total number of cameras = 100

Therefore, if Michael originally started off with 35 cameras instead of 97 before he won the auction and received 65 additional cameras, he would have a total of 100 cameras in his collection.

Total students in a day = Total students for Teacher 1 + Total students for Teacher 2
Total students in a day = 43 + 116 = 159 students

Therefore, in this new scenario, these teachers teach a total of 159 students in a day.

Given:
- John initially bought a total of 139 jackets.
- He bought an additional 35 jackets for his family members.

To find the total number of jackets John bought, we need to add the number of jackets he bought initially and the additional jackets he bought for his family.

Step 1: Find the total number of jackets John bought.
Total jackets bought = Initial jackets bought + Additional jackets bought for family
Total jackets bought = 139 + 35
Total jackets bought = 174 jackets

Therefore, John bought a total of 174 jackets after buying the additional 35 jackets for his family members.

Given information:
- John initially bought 59 jackets.
- John then went to another store and bought 83 more jackets.
- Finally, John noticed a stand with discount jackets and purchased 58 more jackets.

To find the total number of jackets John bought, we need to add the number of jackets he bought in each instance.

Step 1: Calculate the number of jackets John bought initially.
Number of jackets bought initially = 59

Step 2: Calculate the number of jackets John bought at the second store.
Number of jackets bought at the second store = 83

Step 3: Calculate the number of jackets John bought from the discount stand.
Number of jackets bought from the discount stand = 58

Step 4: Calculate the total number of jackets John bought by adding the numbers from the previous steps.
Total number of jackets bought = Number of jackets bought initially + Number of jackets bought at the second store + Number of jackets bought from the discount stand
Total number of jackets bought = 59 + 83 + 58 = 200 jackets

Therefore, under the new conditions, John bought a total of 200 jackets.

Step 1: Find the rainfall on Friday.
Rainfall on Friday = Rainfall on Thursday + Increase in rainfall
Rainfall on Friday = 69 mm + 31 mm
Rainfall on Friday = 100 mm

Step 2: Find the total rainfall on Friday and Saturday.
Total rainfall on Friday and Saturday = Rainfall on Friday + Rainfall on Saturday

Step 1: Find the rainfall on Friday.
Rainfall on Friday = Rainfall on Thursday + Increase in rainfall
Rainfall on Friday = 69 mm + 19 mm
Rainfall on Friday = 88 mm

Step 2: Find the total rainfall on Friday and Saturday.
Total rainfall on Friday and Saturday = Rainfall on Friday + Rainfall on Saturday

            What if instead of selling 77 eyeglasses before May, they only sold 44 eyeglasses? How many eyeglasses has the shop sold in total then (including sales in May, June, and the first week of July)?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate the total number of eyeglasses sold by the shop with the new information.

Given information:
- The shop sold 44 eyeglasses before May.
- The shop sold 44 eyeglasses in May.
- The shop sold 84 eyeglasses in June.
- We need to include the sales from the first week of July.

Step 1: Find the total number of eyeglasses sold before July.
Number of eyeglasses sold before May + Number of eyeglasses sold in May + Number of eyeglasses sold in June
= 44 + 44 + 84
= 172 eyeglasses

Step 2: Assume the shop sold the same number of eyeglasses in the first week of July as in May (44 eyeglasses).

Step 3: Find the total number of eyeglasses sold by adding the number of eyeglasses sold before July and the number of eyeglasses sold in the first week of July.
Total number of eyeglasses sold = Number of eyeglasses sold before July + Number of eyeglasses sold in the first week of July
= 172 + 44
= 216 eyeglasses

Therefore, if the shop sold 44 eyeglasses before May, and we include the sales from the first week of July, the total number of eyeglasses sold by the shop is 216.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of tents and the total number of ground mats, and then add them together.

Given information:
- The group collected 8 small tents.
- The group collected 88 large tents.
- The group added 17 medium tents to their collection.
- The group gathered 77 ground mats for the tents.

Step 1: Find the total number of tents.
Total number of tents = Number of small tents + Number of large tents + Number of medium tents
Total number of tents = 8 + 88 + 17
Total number of tents = 113 tents

Step 2: Find the total number of items (tents and ground mats).
Total number of items = Total number of tents + Number of ground mats
Total number of items = 113 + 77
Total number of items = 190 items

Therefore, the group gathered a total of 190 items, including both tents and ground mats, for the camping trip.

- The group collected 9 small tents (instead of 8).
- The group collected 88 large tents (same as before).
- The group added 17 medium tents to their collection (same as before).
- The group gathered 77 ground mats for the tents (same as before).

Step 1: Find the total number of tents.
Total number of tents = Number of small tents + Number of large tents + Number of medium tents
Total number of tents = 9 + 88 + 17
Total number of tents = 114 tents

Step 2: Find the total number of items (tents and ground mats).
Total number of items = Total number of tents + Number of ground mats
Total number of items = 114 + 77
Total number of items = 191 items

- Teddy's dad gave him 64 teddy bears.
- Teddy's mom gave him 60 teddy bears plus the exact number of teddy bears Teddy's dad gave him.
- Teddy's grandma gave him twice the number of teddy bears his mom gave him.

Step 1: Find the number of teddy bears Teddy's mom gave him.
Teddy's mom gave him = 60 + 64 = 124 teddy bears

Step 2: Find the number of teddy bears Teddy's grandma gave him.
Teddy's grandma gave him = 2 Ã— 124 = 248 teddy bears

Given information:
- There are 84 oak trees in the forest.
- The number of pine trees adds 75 more to the total number of trees.

Step 1: Find the number of pine trees.
Number of pine trees = Total number of trees - Number of oak trees
Number of pine trees = (Number of oak trees + 75) - Number of oak trees
Number of pine trees = 75

Step 2: Find the total number of trees in the forest.
Total number of trees = Number of oak trees + Number of pine trees

Now, we are given that the forest officials planted an additional 68 maple trees in the forest.

To find the total number of trees in the forest after planting the maple trees, we need to add the number of maple trees to the existing number of trees.

Total number of trees after planting maple trees = Original number of trees + Number of maple trees planted
Total number of trees after planting maple trees = 159 + 68
Total number of trees after planting maple trees = 227

- Day 2: The boat traveled 92 miles plus the miles it traveled on Day 1.
- Day 3: The boat traveled 61 miles plus the miles it traveled on the previous days.

Step 1: Find the distance traveled on Day 2.
Distance traveled on Day 2 = Distance traveled on Day 1 + 92 miles
Distance traveled on Day 2 = 88 miles + 92 miles = 180 miles

Step 2: Find the distance traveled on Day 3.
Distance traveled on Day 3 = Distance traveled on Day 2 + 61 miles
Distance traveled on Day 3 = 180 miles + 61 miles = 241 miles

Step 3: Find the total distance traveled over the three days.
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled on Day 1 + Distance traveled on Day 2 + Distance traveled on Day 3

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of earrings Jenna has after making the additional earrings for the special event and replenishing her stock.

Given information:
- Jenna initially has 48 earrings in stock.
- She makes an additional 34 earrings for a special event.
- After the event, she makes 24 more earrings to replenish her stock.

Step 1: Find the total number of earrings after making the additional earrings for the special event.
Initial stock + Additional earrings for the special event = Total earrings after the special event
48 + 34 = 82 earrings

Step 2: Find the total number of earrings after replenishing her stock.
Total earrings after the special event + Earrings made to replenish stock = Total earrings after replenishing stock
82 + 24 = 106 earrings

Therefore, Jenna has a total of 106 earrings after making the additional earrings for the special event and replenishing her stock.

- Jenna initially had 48 earrings in stock.
- She made an additional 34 earrings for a special event.
- After the special event, she decided to make 94 more earrings to replenish her stock instead of the initial plan of making 24 earrings.

Step 1: Find the total number of earrings after making the additional earrings for the special event.
Initial stock + Additional earrings for the special event = Total earrings after the special event
48 + 34 = 82 earrings

Step 2: Find the total number of earrings after replenishing her stock with 94 more earrings.
Total earrings after the special event + Earrings made to replenish stock = Total earrings after replenishing stock

Given information:
- In March, 48 babies were born.
- In April, 25 babies were born.

To find the total number of babies born in these two months, we need to add the number of babies born in March and the number of babies born in April.

Total number of babies born = Number of babies born in March + Number of babies born in April
Total number of babies born = 48 + 25
Total number of babies born = 73

Given information:
- In March, 55 babies were born (updated from 48).
- In April, 25 babies were born.

To find the total number of babies born in these two months, we need to add the number of babies born in March and the number of babies born in April.

Total number of babies born = Number of babies born in March + Number of babies born in April
Total number of babies born = 55 + 25
Total number of babies born = 80

Therefore, with the updated information that 55 babies were born in March, the total number of babies born in March and April is 80.

Step 1: Find the total number of drum sets in the store.
Total number of drum sets = Number of drum sets on display + Number of drum sets in the store room
Total number of drum sets = 52 + 1 = 53 drum sets

Step 2: Find the total number of drums in the store.
Total number of drums = Number of single drums
Total number of drums = 46 drums

Step 3: Find the total number of drums and drum sets in the store.
Total number of drums and drum sets = Total number of drum sets + Total number of drums
Total number of drums and drum sets = 53 + 46 = 99

- There is 1 drum set in the store room.
- There are 46 single drums in a different section of the store.

Step 1: Find the total number of single drums in the store.
Total number of single drums = Number of single drums on display + Number of single drums in a different section
Total number of single drums = 52 + 46 = 98 single drums

Step 2: Find the total number of drum sets in the store.
Total number of drum sets = Number of drum sets in the store room
Total number of drum sets = 1 drum set

Step 3: Find the total number of drums and drum sets in the store.

- On the second day, the seller added 22 more boxes to the total from the previous day.
- On the third day, the seller added another 26 boxes to that day's total.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes on the first day.
Number of boxes on the first day = 9 boxes

Step 2: Find the number of boxes on the second day.
Number of boxes on the second day = Number of boxes on the first day + Additional boxes added
Number of boxes on the second day = 9 + 22 = 31 boxes

Step 3: Find the number of boxes on the third day (last day).

Number of clouds formed from the first cloud = 8 + 13 = 21 clouds

Step 2: Find the total number of clouds formed from the second cloud.
Since the second cloud split the same way as the first cloud, the number of clouds formed from the second cloud is also 21.

Step 3: Find the total number of clouds formed from both clouds.
Total number of clouds formed = Number of clouds formed from the first cloud + Number of clouds formed from the second cloud
Total number of clouds formed = 21 + 21 = 42 clouds

Therefore, a total of 42 clouds were formed after the two clouds split.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* Initially, two clouds split into:
    - 8 small clouds and 13 larger clouds from the first cloud
    - 8 small clouds and 13 larger clouds from the second cloud
* So the total number of clouds after the initial split was:
    - 8 + 13 + 8 + 13 = 42 clouds
* Then, the original clouds came back together and formed 91 additional smaller clouds.

To find the total number of clouds now, we need to add the initial 42 clouds to the 91 additional smaller clouds.

Total number of clouds = Initial number of clouds + Additional smaller clouds
Total number of clouds = 42 + 91
Total number of clouds = 133

Therefore, there are now 133 total clouds including the additional smaller clouds formed.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the new information.

Given information:
- Initially, there were two clouds.
- Each of the two clouds split into 43 small clouds and 13 larger clouds.

Step 1: Find the total number of clouds formed from the first cloud.
Number of clouds formed from the first cloud = 43 small clouds + 13 larger clouds
Number of clouds formed from the first cloud = 43 + 13 = 56 clouds

Step 2: Find the total number of clouds formed from the second cloud.
Since the second cloud split in the same way as the first cloud, the number of clouds formed from the second cloud is also 56.

Step 3: Find the total number of clouds formed from both clouds.
Total number of clouds formed = Number of clouds formed from the first cloud + Number of clouds formed from the second cloud
Total number of clouds formed = 56 + 56 = 112 clouds

Therefore, if each of the two clouds split into 43 small clouds and 13 larger clouds, a total of 112 clouds would have formed.

Given information:
- Oliver can currently perform 77 stunts with his skateboard.
- He will learn to perform each stunt in reverse.

Step 1: Find the number of stunts Oliver can perform after learning the reverse stunts.
Number of stunts after learning reverse stunts = Original number of stunts + Number of reverse stunts
Number of reverse stunts = Original number of stunts (since each stunt has a reverse version)
Number of stunts after learning reverse stunts = 77 + 77 = 154

- Oliver learned 27 additional new stunts.

Step 1: Find the total number of stunts Oliver can perform after learning the 27 additional new stunts.
Total number of stunts = Number of stunts after learning reverse stunts + Number of additional new stunts
Total number of stunts = 154 + 27 = 181

Step 2: Since Oliver can perform each new stunt in reverse, we need to add the 27 new stunts again.
Total number of stunts = 181 + 27 = 208

Given:
- Oliver initially learned 61 stunts.
- He can perform each stunt in reverse, effectively creating a new trick.

To calculate the total number of stunts Oliver can perform, we need to consider the original stunts and their reverse versions.

Step 1: Calculate the number of original stunts.
Number of original stunts = 61

Step 2: Calculate the number of reverse stunts.
Number of reverse stunts = Number of original stunts
Number of reverse stunts = 61

Step 3: Calculate the total number of stunts Oliver can perform.
Total number of stunts = Number of original stunts + Number of reverse stunts
Total number of stunts = 61 + 61 = 122

Therefore, after learning 61 stunts and being able to perform each of them in reverse, Oliver can now perform a total of 122 skateboard stunts.

Given information:
- The binoculars increase visibility by 22 degrees in one direction.
- The binoculars increase visibility by 26 degrees in another direction.

To find the total increase in the angle of visibility, we simply need to add the two angles together.

Total increase in the angle of visibility = 22 degrees + 26 degrees
Total increase in the angle of visibility = 48 degrees

Therefore, the total increase in the angle of visibility when both directions are considered is 48 degrees.

Given information:
- The binoculars initially increase visibility by 22 degrees in one direction and 26 degrees in another direction.
- An additional lens is added that further increases the visibility by 76 degrees.

Step 1: Find the total increase in the angle of visibility from the binoculars alone.
Total increase from binoculars = 22 degrees + 26 degrees = 48 degrees

Step 2: Add the increase in visibility from the additional lens to the total increase from the binoculars.
Total increase in the angle of visibility = Total increase from binoculars + Increase from additional lens
Total increase in the angle of visibility = 48 degrees + 76 degrees = 124 degrees

- The binoculars increase visibility by 14 degrees in one direction (instead of 22 degrees).
- The binoculars increase visibility by 26 degrees in another direction (same as before).

To find the total increase in the angle of visibility, we need to add the two angles together.

Total increase in the angle of visibility = Increase in one direction + Increase in another direction
Total increase in the angle of visibility = 14 degrees + 26 degrees
Total increase in the angle of visibility = 40 degrees

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of flowers in Mira's garden after planting the daisies.

Given information:
- Mira has 82 roses in her garden.
- Mira plants 12 additional daisies.

Step 1: Find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and daisies.
Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of daisies
Total number of flowers = 82 + 12
Total number of flowers = 94

Therefore, after planting the daisies, Mira has a total of 94 flowers in her garden.

Given information:
- Mira originally had 88 roses in her garden.
- Mira planted 12 additional daisies.

To find the total number of flowers in Mira's garden after planting the daisies, we need to add the number of roses and daisies.

Step 1: Find the total number of flowers by adding the number of roses and daisies.
Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of daisies
Total number of flowers = 88 + 12
Total number of flowers = 100

Given information:
- The jeweler used 219 gems for the bracelet.
- To make a matching necklace, he added 60 more gems.

To find the total number of gems used for both the bracelet and the necklace, we need to add the number of gems used for the bracelet and the additional gems used for the necklace.

Total number of gems used = Number of gems for the bracelet + Number of gems for the necklace
Total number of gems used = 219 + 60
Total number of gems used = 279 gems

Given information:
- The computer's initial operating power is 96 Watts.
- After an update, the operational power increases by an additional 84 Watts.

Step 1: Add the initial operating power and the additional power after the update.
Initial operating power + Additional power after the update = Computer's operation power after the update

- By the middle of the month, the penguin had as many fish as the initial amount plus 31 more.
- At the end of the month, the penguin had as many fish as the amount he had in the middle of the month and the initial 31 fish.

Step 1: Find the number of fish the penguin had in the middle of the month.
Number of fish in the middle of the month = Initial amount of fish + 31
Number of fish in the middle of the month = 31 + 31 = 62 fish

Step 2: Find the number of fish the penguin had at the end of the month.
Number of fish at the end of the month = Number of fish in the middle of the month + Initial amount of fish
Number of fish at the end of the month = 62 + 31 = 93 fish

- At the beginning of the month, the penguin had 31 fish.
- By the middle of the month, the penguin had as many fish as the initial amount plus 21 more (instead of 31 more).
- At the end of the month, the penguin had as many fish as the amount he had in the middle of the month and the initial 31 fish.

Step 1: Find the number of fish the penguin had in the middle of the month.
Number of fish in the middle of the month = Initial amount of fish + 21
Number of fish in the middle of the month = 31 + 21 = 52 fish

Step 2: Find the number of fish the penguin had at the end of the month.
Number of fish at the end of the month = Number of fish in the middle of the month + Initial amount of fish
Number of fish at the end of the month = 52 + 31 = 83 fish

Step 1: Find the number of cookies Katie baked in the afternoon.
Number of cookies baked in the afternoon = Number of cookies baked in the morning
Number of cookies baked in the afternoon = 34 cookies

Step 2: Find the total number of cookies Katie baked.
Total number of cookies baked = Number of cookies baked in the morning + Number of cookies baked in the afternoon

Number of cookies baked in the afternoon = 23 cookies

Step 2: Find the total number of cookies Katie baked.
Total number of cookies baked = Number of cookies baked in the morning + Number of cookies baked in the afternoon
Total number of cookies baked = 23 + 23

Distance covered in the first two jumps = 31 cm + 31 cm = 62 cm

Step 2: Calculate the distance covered in the third jump.
Distance covered in the third jump = Height of the flower - Height of the leaf
Distance covered in the third jump = 69 cm - 31 cm = 38 cm

Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered by the frog in all three jumps.
Total distance covered = Distance covered in the first two jumps + Distance covered in the third jump
Total distance covered = 62 cm + 38 cm = 100 cm

Therefore, the frog covered a total distance of 100 cm in all three jumps.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Suppose instead of the initial 31 cm, the leaves were only 20 cm above the ground when the frog first started jumping. Given the same jumps as before, how much distance in centimeters would the frog cover then?
        </p>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this case, the initial height of the leaf from the ground is 20 cm instead of 31 cm.

Given information:
- The initial leaf is 20 cm from the ground.
- The frog jumps and reaches an exact same spot on another leaf.

Since the frog reaches the same height on the second leaf, the distance covered by the frog is the sum of the height from the ground to the leaf and the height from the leaf to the ground.

Distance covered = Height from the ground to the leaf + Height from the leaf to the ground
Distance covered = 20 cm + 20 cm
Distance covered = 40 cm

Therefore, if the leaves were 20 cm above the ground, the frog would cover a total distance of 40 cm in its jump.

Given information:
- Olivia wrote 70 words on the first day.
- Olivia wrote 23 words on the second day.
- Isabella wrote 17 words in her assignment.

Step 1: Find the total number of words written by Olivia.
Olivia's total words = Words written on the first day + Words written on the second day
Olivia's total words = 70 + 23
Olivia's total words = 93 words

Step 2: Find the total number of words written by Isabella.
Isabella's total words = 17 words

Step 3: Find the total number of words written by both Olivia and Isabella.
Total words written by Olivia and Isabella = Olivia's total words + Isabella's total words
Total words written by Olivia and Isabella = 93 + 17

Given information:
- Olivia wrote a total of 93 words (70 words on the first day and 23 words on the second day).
- Initially, Isabella wrote 17 words.
- Isabella decided to write an additional 17 words.

Step 1: Find the total number of words written by Isabella after adding the additional 17 words.
Isabella's initial words = 17 words
Additional words written by Isabella = 17 words
Isabella's total words = Initial words + Additional words
Isabella's total words = 17 + 17 = 34 words

Step 2: Find the total number of words written by both Olivia and Isabella after Isabella's additional contribution.
Total words written by Olivia and Isabella = Olivia's total words + Isabella's total words
Total words written by Olivia and Isabella = 93 + 34
Total words written by Olivia and Isabella = 127 words

Therefore, after Isabella's additional contribution of 17 words, the total number of words written by both Olivia and Isabella is 127 words.

- The number of riders picked up during the afternoon route is exactly the same as the morning route.

Step 1: Find the total number of riders picked up during the afternoon route.
Number of riders picked up during the afternoon route = Number of riders picked up during the morning route
Number of riders picked up during the afternoon route = 66

Step 2: Find the total number of riders picked up during both the morning and afternoon routes.
Total riders picked up = Riders picked up during the morning route + Riders picked up during the afternoon route

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pencils after buying the same amount as the initial number of pencils.

Given information:
- You initially have 30 pencils.
- You bought an exact same amount more.

Step 1: Find the number of pencils you bought.
Number of pencils bought = Initial number of pencils
Number of pencils bought = 30 pencils

Step 2: Find the total number of pencils after buying the same amount.
Total number of pencils = Initial number of pencils + Number of pencils bought
Total number of pencils = 30 + 30
Total number of pencils = 60 pencils

Therefore, after buying the same amount of pencils as the initial number, you now have 60 pencils.

Given information:
- Initially, you had 30 pencils.
- You bought an additional 30 pencils, making the total 60 pencils.
- Your friend gifted you 15 more pencils.

To find the total number of pencils you have now, we need to add the number of pencils you had after buying the additional pencils and the number of pencils gifted by your friend.

Step 1: Find the total number of pencils after buying the additional pencils.
Total number of pencils after buying additional pencils = 60 pencils

Step 2: Add the number of pencils gifted by your friend.
Total number of pencils = Total number of pencils after buying additional pencils + Number of pencils gifted by your friend
Total number of pencils = 60 + 15
Total number of pencils = 75 pencils

Therefore, after buying the same amount of additional pencils and receiving 15 more pencils from your friend, you now have a total of 75 pencils.

Number of pencils bought = Initial number of pencils
Number of pencils bought = 80 pencils

Step 2: Find the total number of pencils after buying the same amount.
Total number of pencils = Initial number of pencils + Number of pencils bought

To find the total minutes of TV Peter watched in the whole day, we need to add the additional 92 minutes to the previous total.

Step 1: Find the total minutes of TV Peter watched in the whole day.
Total minutes of TV watched in the whole day = Total minutes from morning and evening + Additional minutes before bedtime
Total minutes of TV watched in the whole day = 177 minutes + 92 minutes

To find the total number of balls Jake has now, we need to add the additional 12 balls to the 138 balls he already had.

Step 1: Add the additional balls to the number of balls Jake already had.
Total number of balls Jake has now = Number of balls Jake had after buying more + Additional balls received as a gift
Total number of balls Jake has now = 138 + 12
Total number of balls Jake has now = 150 balls

- On his way out, the zookeeper realized that he needed to revisit a previously counted section of 72 elephants.

Step 1: Find the total number of elephants counted without considering the double-counting.
Total elephants counted = Elephants in the first section + Elephants in the next section
Total elephants counted = 53 + 71 = 124 elephants

Step 2: Subtract the double-counted section from the total.
Total elephants counted after removing double-counting = Total elephants counted - Double-counted section
Total elephants counted after removing double-counting = 124 - 72 = 52 elephants

Total number of sandwiches = Sarah's sandwiches + Kevin's sandwiches
Total number of sandwiches = 80 + x

Given information:
- Sam's computer initially had 23GB of storage space left.

To find the total storage space now, we need to add the initial storage space left and the additional storage space freed up.

To find the new total number of fish in the tank, we need to add the previous total (96 fish) and the number of fish added (51 fish).

New total number of fish in the tank = Previous total number of fish + Number of fish added
New total number of fish in the tank = 96 + 51

            Bobby goes to the local park and decides to test how high he can swing on three different swings. On the first swing, he goes 56 feet in the air, then comes back down and goes another 53 feet high. On the second swing, he goes as high as he did on the first one plus an additional 5 feet. On the third swing, he challenges himself and goes as high as he did on the second one plus an additional 34 feet. How high did Bobby swing on the third swing?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the height Bobby reached on the second swing and then add 34 feet to it.

Given information:
- On the first swing, Bobby went 56 feet high and then 53 feet high.
- On the second swing, he went as high as he did on the first one plus an additional 5 feet.
- On the third swing, he went as high as he did on the second one plus an additional 34 feet.

Step 1: Find the height Bobby reached on the first swing.
Height on the first swing = Maximum of 56 feet and 53 feet
Height on the first swing = 56 feet

Step 2: Find the height Bobby reached on the second swing.
Height on the second swing = Height on the first swing + 5 feet
Height on the second swing = 56 feet + 5 feet
Height on the second swing = 61 feet

Step 3: Find the height Bobby reached on the third swing.
Height on the third swing = Height on the second swing + 34 feet
Height on the third swing = 61 feet + 34 feet
Height on the third swing = 95 feet

Therefore, Bobby swung 95 feet high on the third swing.

Given information:
- The new score of the letter Z is 90.
- The score of the letter U is still the sum of 31 and the score of Z.

Step 1: Find the new score of the letter U.
New score of the letter U = 31 + New score of the letter Z
New score of the letter U = 31 + 90
New score of the letter U = 121

Therefore, with the new score of the letter Z being 90, the new score of the letter U in the word game is 121.

Given information:
- Mathew has 81 ounces of apple juice initially.
- Mathew adds 99 ounces of orange juice to the apple juice.

To find the total amount of juice, we need to add the amount of apple juice and the amount of orange juice.

Total amount of juice = Amount of apple juice + Amount of orange juice
Total amount of juice = 81 ounces + 99 ounces
Total amount of juice = 81 ounces + 99 ounces
Total amount of juice = 180 ounces

- First increase in viewing distance = 80 meters
- Second increase in viewing distance = 92 meters

Step 1: Calculate the viewing distance after the first increase.
Initial viewing distance + First increase = New viewing distance after first increase
91 meters + 80 meters = 171 meters

Step 2: Calculate the total viewing distance after the second increase.
New viewing distance after first increase + Second increase = Total viewing distance

Step 1: Find the number of keys in the new set.
Number of keys in the new set = Number of keys in the original set + 56
Number of keys in the new set = 42 + 56
Number of keys in the new set = 98 keys

Step 2: Find the total number of keys Bobby has by adding the keys from the original set and the new set.
Total number of keys = Number of keys in the original set + Number of keys in the new set

- The new set of keys has 23 more keys than the original set.
- Bobby's keychain includes both the original set of keys and the new set of keys.

Step 1: Find the number of keys in the new set.
Number of keys in the new set = Number of keys in the original set + 23
Number of keys in the new set = 42 + 23
Number of keys in the new set = 65 keys

Step 2: Find the total number of keys Bobby has by adding the keys from the original set and the new set.
Total number of keys = Number of keys in the original set + Number of keys in the new set
Total number of keys = 42 + 65
Total number of keys = 107 keys

- She gathered 45 more carrots from her farm, making it a total of 90 carrots.
- Jordy buys 4 more carrots from the local market.

To find the total number of carrots Jordy has now, we need to add the number of carrots she bought from the local market to the total number of carrots she had before.

Step 1: Find the total number of carrots Jordy had before going to the local market.
Total number of carrots before going to the market = 90 carrots

Step 2: Find the total number of carrots Jordy has now after buying 4 more carrots from the local market.
Total number of carrots now = Total number of carrots before going to the market + Number of carrots bought from the market
Total number of carrots now = 90 + 4

- The second artist used 67 more strokes than the first artist.
- The third artist doubled the total number of strokes used by the second artist.
- If the first artist had used 81 blue strokes instead of 53 red strokes, the total number of strokes used by the first artist would have been 43 + 81 = 124 strokes.

Step 1: Find the total number of strokes used by the second artist if the first artist had used 81 blue strokes.
Total strokes used by the first artist (with 81 blue strokes) + Additional strokes used by the second artist = Total strokes used by the second artist
124 + 67 = 191 strokes

Step 2: Find the total number of strokes used by the third artist if the first artist had used 81 blue strokes.
Total strokes used by the third artist = 2 Ã— Total strokes used by the second artist
Total strokes used by the third artist = 2 Ã— 191 = 382 strokes

Therefore, if the first artist had used 81 blue strokes instead of 53 red strokes, and keeping all other elements the same, the third artist's painting would have had 382 strokes.

Given information:
- You bought 42 ice cream cones for the first group of friends.
- You bought the same amount of ice cream cones for the second group of friends.

Step 1: Find the number of ice cream cones bought for the second group of friends.
Number of ice cream cones for the second group = Number of ice cream cones for the first group
Number of ice cream cones for the second group = 42 ice cream cones

Step 2: Find the total number of ice cream cones bought for both groups.
Total number of ice cream cones = Number of ice cream cones for the first group + Number of ice cream cones for the second group
Total number of ice cream cones = 42 + 42
Total number of ice cream cones = 84

Therefore, you bought a total of 84 ice cream cones for both groups of friends.

Given information:
- You bought 42 ice cream cones for the first group of friends.
- You bought 42 ice cream cones for the second group of friends.
- You bought ice cream cones for a third group of 59 friends.

Step 1: Find the total number of ice cream cones bought for the first two groups.
Total number of ice cream cones for the first two groups = 42 + 42 = 84 ice cream cones

Step 2: Find the number of ice cream cones bought for the third group of 59 friends.
Number of ice cream cones for the third group = 59 ice cream cones

Step 3: Find the total number of ice cream cones bought for all three groups.
Total number of ice cream cones = Total number of ice cream cones for the first two groups + Number of ice cream cones for the third group
Total number of ice cream cones = 84 + 59
Total number of ice cream cones = 143

Therefore, you have bought a total of 143 ice cream cones for all three groups of friends.

            Mike's left binocular lens can magnify objects from a distance of 30 miles away, and the right lens can magnify objects that are 56 miles away.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum distance that can be magnified by either the binoculars or the telescope, and then add the remaining distances that can be magnified by the other two.

Given information:
- Mike's left binocular lens can magnify objects from a distance of 30 miles away.
- Mike's right binocular lens can magnify objects from a distance of 56 miles away.
- Mike's telescope can magnify objects from a distance of 67 miles away.

Step 1: Find the maximum distance that can be magnified by either the binoculars or the telescope.
Maximum distance = 67 miles (telescope)

Step 2: Add the remaining distances that can be magnified by the binoculars.
Remaining distances = 30 miles (left binocular lens) + 56 miles (right binocular lens)
Remaining distances = 30 miles + 56 miles = 86 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance from which both binoculars and telescope can magnify objects.
Total distance = Maximum distance + Remaining distances
Total distance = 67 miles + 86 miles = 153 miles

Therefore, the total distance from which both Mike's binoculars and telescope can magnify objects is 153 miles.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous problem, we considered the distance that Mike's binocular's two lenses can magnify. Consider now that we made a mistake and that the left lens can actually magnify objects from a distance of 54 miles away instead of 30 miles. Keeping the right lense and the telescope the same at 56 and 67 miles respectively, what would be the new total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate the total distance from which both Mike's binoculars and telescope can magnify objects, considering the updated distance for the left binocular lens.

Given information:
- Mike's left binocular lens can magnify objects from a distance of 54 miles away.
- Mike's right binocular lens can magnify objects from a distance of 56 miles away.
- Mike's telescope can magnify objects from a distance of 67 miles away.

Step 1: Find the maximum distance that can be magnified by either the binoculars or the telescope.
Maximum distance = 67 miles (telescope)

Step 2: Add the remaining distances that can be magnified by the binoculars.
Remaining distances = 54 miles (left binocular lens) + 56 miles (right binocular lens)
Remaining distances = 54 miles + 56 miles = 110 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance from which both binoculars and telescope can magnify objects.
Total distance = Maximum distance + Remaining distances
Total distance = 67 miles + 110 miles = 177 miles

Therefore, with the left binocular lens magnifying objects from a distance of 54 miles away, the new total distance from which both Mike's binoculars and telescope can magnify objects is 177 miles.

- This amount is then topped up by 25 Quiblets to cast the most powerful spell.

Step 1: Find the number of Quiblets required for the slightly stronger spell.
Number of Quiblets for one wand spell + Additional Quiblets for slightly stronger spell
