    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of tomatoes John has after picking them from his garden and his neighbor's garden.

Given information:
- John initially has 2 tomatoes.
- He found the same amount of tomatoes in his garden as he initially had.
- He picked 7 more tomatoes from his neighbor's garden.

Step 1: Find the number of tomatoes John found in his garden.
Number of tomatoes John initially had = 2
Number of tomatoes he found in his garden = Same as the initial amount = 2

Step 2: Find the total number of tomatoes John has after picking from his garden.
Total tomatoes after picking from his garden = Initial tomatoes + Tomatoes from his garden
Total tomatoes after picking from his garden = 2 + 2 = 4

Step 3: Find the total number of tomatoes John has after picking from his neighbor's garden.
Total tomatoes after picking from neighbor's garden = Total tomatoes after picking from his garden + Tomatoes from neighbor's garden
Total tomatoes after picking from neighbor's garden = 4 + 7 = 11

Therefore, John now has 11 tomatoes.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's continue with the scenario where John initially had 2 tomatoes and found the same amount in his garden, but this time he picked 14 more tomatoes from his neighbor's garden.

Given information:
- John initially had 2 tomatoes.
- He found the same amount of tomatoes in his garden as he initially had, which is 2 tomatoes.
- He picked 14 more tomatoes from his neighbor's garden.

Step 1: Find the number of tomatoes John has after picking from his garden.
Total tomatoes after picking from his garden = Initial tomatoes + Tomatoes from his garden
Total tomatoes after picking from his garden = 2 + 2 = 4

Step 2: Find the total number of tomatoes John has after picking from his neighbor's garden.
Total tomatoes after picking from neighbor's garden = Total tomatoes after picking from his garden + Tomatoes from neighbor's garden
Total tomatoes after picking from neighbor's garden = 4 + 14 = 18

Therefore, with the updated scenario, John now has 18 tomatoes.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total mass of the two rocket fuels combined.

Given information:
- Mass of Rocket Fuel A = 8 kg
- Mass of Rocket Fuel B = 7 kg

To find the total mass, we need to add the masses of Rocket Fuel A and Rocket Fuel B.

Total mass = Mass of Rocket Fuel A + Mass of Rocket Fuel B
Total mass = 8 kg + 7 kg
Total mass = 15 kg

Therefore, the total amount of rocket fuel is 15 kg.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total mass of the rocket fuel mixture after adding Rocket Fuel C.

Given information:
- Initial total mass of the rocket fuel mixture = 15 kg (from the previous problem)
- Mass of Rocket Fuel C added = 5 kg

To find the new total mass, we need to add the mass of Rocket Fuel C to the initial total mass.

New total mass = Initial total mass + Mass of Rocket Fuel C
New total mass = 15 kg + 5 kg
New total mass = 20 kg

Therefore, after adding Rocket Fuel C, the total amount of rocket fuel in the mixture is 20 kg.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* Initially, Randy combined 7 kg of Rocket Fuel A and 7 kg of Rocket Fuel B
* We need to find the total amount of rocket fuel before adding Rocket Fuel C

To find the total, we add the masses of Rocket Fuel A and Rocket Fuel B:
* Mass of Rocket Fuel A = 7 kg
* Mass of Rocket Fuel B = 7 kg
* Total mass = Mass of Rocket Fuel A + Mass of Rocket Fuel B
* Total mass = 7 kg + 7 kg
* Total mass = 14 kg

Therefore, before adding Rocket Fuel C, the total amount of rocket fuel would be 14 kg.

Given information:
- James initially had 7 chairs in his living room.
- He added 11 more chairs for a family gathering.

To find the total number of chairs, we need to add the initial number of chairs and the number of chairs added.

Total number of chairs = Initial number of chairs + Number of chairs added
Total number of chairs = 7 + 11
Total number of chairs = 18

Therefore, James has a total of 18 chairs in his living room now.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this problem, we need to find the total number of chairs in James's living room after adding one more chair.

Given:
- Initially, James had 7 chairs in his living room.
- He added 11 more chairs for the family gathering, making the total 18 chairs.
- After the family gathering, James decided to add one more chair as a special spot for him to sit and read.

To calculate the new total number of chairs, we need to add the one extra chair to the previous total.

Previous total number of chairs = 18
Number of chairs added = 1

New total number of chairs = Previous total number of chairs + Number of chairs added
New total number of chairs = 18 + 1
New total number of chairs = 19

Therefore, there are now 19 chairs in James's living room.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* Initially, Officer Johnson was supposed to check a total of 19 locations (10 already checked + 9 more to check)
* Now, he is informed that there is an additional location he needs to patrol
* To find the new total, we take the initial total and add 1 for the additional location:
    * New total = Initial total + 1
    * New total = 19 + 1
    * New total = 20

Therefore, with the additional location, Officer Johnson now needs to check a total of 20 locations.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's revisit the problem with the new information.

Given information:
- Officer Johnson was initially supposed to check 1 location.
- Over the next hour, he is supposed to check 9 more locations.

To find the total number of locations Officer Johnson is supposed to check, we need to add the initial number of locations and the number of locations to be checked in the next hour.

Step 1: Find the total number of locations Officer Johnson is supposed to check.
Total locations = Initial number of locations + Locations to be checked in the next hour
Total locations = 1 + 9
Total locations = 10

Therefore, with the new information, Officer Johnson is supposed to check a total of 10 locations.

Given information:
- The distance from the starting point to the first landmark is 3 km.
- The distance from the first landmark to the second landmark is 17 km.

To find the total distance, we need to add the distance from the starting point to the first landmark and the distance from the first landmark to the second landmark.

Total distance = Distance from starting point to first landmark + Distance from first landmark to second landmark
Total distance = 3 km + 17 km
Total distance = 20 km

Therefore, Emily planned to cover a total distance of 20 km between the two landmarks.

Given:
- Miny starts with 1 magical stone.
- At the fairy party, she receives 11 additional magical stones, represented by the variable b.
- After the party, she collects 2 more stones on her way home.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stones Miny has after the fairy party.
Number of stones after the party = Initial number of stones + Stones received at the party
Number of stones after the party = 1 + b
Number of stones after the party = 1 + 11 = 12

Step 2: Calculate the total number of stones Miny has after collecting 2 more stones on her way home.
Total number of stones = Number of stones after the party + Stones collected on the way home
Total number of stones = 12 + 2 = 14

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's consider the new information:
* Initially, there was 1 T-Rex exhibit
* There was 1 Brachiosaurus exhibit

To find the total number of dinosaur exhibits before the Pterodactyl exhibits were added, we need to add the number of T-Rex exhibits and the number of Brachiosaurus exhibits.

Total number of dinosaur exhibits before Pterodactyl exhibits were added
= Number of T-Rex exhibits + Number of Brachiosaurus exhibits
= 1 + 1
= 2

Given information:
- Derek initially has 10 toy cars at home.
- Derek buys 6 more toy cars from the store.

To find the total number of toy cars, we need to add the number of toy cars he had initially and the number of toy cars he bought from the store.

Total number of toy cars = Initial number of toy cars + Number of toy cars bought from the store
Total number of toy cars = 10 + 6
Total number of toy cars = 16

- Derek bought 6 more toy cars from the store.
- Jake brings 1 more toy car to play with.

Step 1: Find the total number of toy cars Derek has after buying from the store.
Total number of toy cars Derek has = Initial number of toy cars + Number of toy cars bought from the store
Total number of toy cars Derek has = 10 + 6 = 16

Step 2: Find the total number of toy cars after Jake brings 1 more toy car.
Total number of toy cars = Total number of toy cars Derek has + Number of toy cars Jake brings
Total number of toy cars = 16 + 1 = 17

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate with the new information.

Given information:
- Derek initially has 8 toy cars at home.
- Derek buys 6 more toy cars from the store.

To find the total number of toy cars, we need to add the number of toy cars he had initially and the number of toy cars he bought from the store.

Total number of toy cars = Initial number of toy cars + Number of toy cars bought from the store
Total number of toy cars = 8 + 6
Total number of toy cars = 14

Given information:
- John initially had 6 logs in the fireplace.
- He added 6 more logs to keep the fire going.

To find the total number of logs, we need to add the initial number of logs and the number of logs added.

Given:
- Initially, there were 6 logs in the fireplace.
- John added 6 more logs, making it 12 logs in the fireplace.
- After some time, John added 4 more logs.

To find the total number of logs now, we need to add the 4 new logs to the previous total of 12 logs.

Total number of logs = Previous total + Number of logs added
Total number of logs = 12 + 4
Total number of logs = 16

Therefore, after adding 4 more logs, there are now 16 logs in the fireplace.

Given information:
- There are 16 dogs living in different houses in the neighborhood.
- One of the houses has 3 dogs.

Since we know that there are 16 dogs in total, and one house has 3 dogs, we can subtract 3 from 16 to find the number of dogs in the remaining houses.

Number of dogs in the remaining houses = Total dogs - Dogs in the house with 3 dogs
Number of dogs in the remaining houses = 16 - 3 = 13

Now, we can add the dogs in the house with 3 dogs to the dogs in the remaining houses to find the total number of dogs in the neighborhood.

Total dogs in the neighborhood = Dogs in the remaining houses + Dogs in the house with 3 dogs
Total dogs in the neighborhood = 13 + 3 = 16

- Quinn gave Sam 11 more bottles of water.
- So, after receiving bottles from Quinn, Sam had 6 + 11 = 17 bottles of water.
- Now, Sam's girlfriend gives him 1 more bottle of water.

To find the total number of bottles Sam has now, we need to add the 1 bottle from his girlfriend to the 17 bottles he already had.

Total number of bottles = Number of bottles Sam had after receiving from Quinn + Number of bottles received from his girlfriend
Total number of bottles = 17 + 1
Total number of bottles = 18

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of sharks observed by the researcher during the whole day.

Given information:
- The researcher observed 9 sharks during the morning expedition.
- The researcher observed 11 more sharks during the afternoon expedition.

To find the total number of sharks observed, we need to add the number of sharks observed in the morning and afternoon expeditions.

Total number of sharks observed = Number of sharks observed in the morning + Number of sharks observed in the afternoon
Total number of sharks observed = 9 + 11
Total number of sharks observed = 20

Therefore, the researcher observed a total of 20 sharks during the whole day.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the initial number of stones the princess had.
   Initial number of stones = 2

2. Find the number of stones after the wizard doubled them.
   Number of stones after doubling = 2 × 2 = 4

3. Find the number of stones after the princess found 11 more stones.
   Number of stones after finding 11 more = 4 + 11 = 15

Therefore, the princess now has 15 magical stones.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's continue from where we left off.

Previously, we found that after finding 11 more stones, the princess had:
Number of stones = 4 (after doubling) + 11 (found stones) = 15

Now, the fairy presents her with 3 more magical stones.

So, we need to add 3 to the previous total:
Number of stones after the fairy's gift = 15 + 3 = 18

Therefore, the total number of magical stones the princess has now is 18.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate with the new information:

1. The princess initially had 2 magical stones.
2. The wizard doubled the amount, so she had 2 x 2 = 4 stones.
3. Instead of finding 11 more stones, she actually found 15 more stones.
4. So the total number of stones now is:
   Number of stones after the wizard doubled them + Number of stones found
   = 4 + 15
   = 19

Therefore, with the new information that she found 15 stones instead of 11, the princess now has 19 magical stones.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* Originally, there were 15 giraffes in the zoo
* The zoo brought in 3 more giraffes

To find the new total, we add the original number of giraffes to the number of new giraffes:

Original number of giraffes + Number of new giraffes = New total number of giraffes
15 + 3 = 18

Therefore, after bringing in 3 more giraffes, there are now 18 giraffes in the zoo in total.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given information:
- There are 5 giraffes in one area.
- There are 7 giraffes in another area.

To find the total number of giraffes in the zoo, we need to add the number of giraffes in the two areas.

Step 1: Add the number of giraffes in the two areas.
Number of giraffes in the first area + Number of giraffes in the second area = Total number of giraffes in the zoo
5 + 7 = 12

Therefore, if the zoo originally had 5 giraffes in one area and 7 giraffes in the other area, there would be a total of 12 giraffes in the zoo.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the number of coins Draco found in the cave and the number of coins he found in the forest.

Given information:
- Draco found 13 coins in a cave.
- Draco found 5 more coins in the forest.

Step 1: Add the number of coins found in the cave and the forest.
Number of coins found in the cave + Number of coins found in the forest = Total number of coins gathered

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given information:
- Draco found 3 coins in the cave.
- Draco found 5 more coins in the forest.

To find the total number of coins Draco gathered, we need to add the number of coins found in the cave and the number of coins found in the forest.

Step 1: Add the number of coins found in the cave and the forest.
Number of coins found in the cave + Number of coins found in the forest = Total number of coins gathered
3 + 5 = 8

Therefore, with the updated information, Draco gathered a total of 8 gold coins.

Total number of puzzle pieces = Initial number of puzzle pieces + Number of puzzle pieces given by his brother
Total number of puzzle pieces = 1 + 19
Total number of puzzle pieces = 20

Given information:
- Stella initially has 5 erasers.
- Stella buys 1 more eraser.

Step 1: Find the number of erasers Stella has after buying 1 more.
Number of erasers after buying 1 more = Initial number of erasers + Number of erasers bought
Number of erasers after buying 1 more = 5 + 1
Number of erasers after buying 1 more = 6

Therefore, after buying 1 more eraser, Stella now has 6 erasers.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* Initially, Stella had 5 erasers
* She bought 1 more eraser, so she had 6 erasers
* Now, her best friend gifted her 12 more erasers

To find the total number of erasers Stella has now, we need to add the number of erasers she had previously (6) to the number of erasers gifted to her (12).

Total number of erasers = Previous number of erasers + Number of erasers gifted
Total number of erasers = 6 + 12
Total number of erasers = 18

Therefore, after receiving the gift of 12 erasers from her best friend, Stella now has a total of 18 erasers.

Step 1: Find the total number of doors after building the first 9 additional doors.
Total number of doors after building 9 doors = Initial number of doors + First additional doors built
Total number of doors after building 9 doors = 4 + 9 = 13 doors

Step 2: Find the total number of doors after building the second set of 6 additional doors.
Total number of doors after building 6 more doors = Total number of doors after building 9 doors + Second additional doors built
Total number of doors after building 6 more doors = 13 + 6 = 19 doors

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the number of logs already in the fireplace after George added his logs, and the number of logs added by Kim.

Given information:
- After George added 9 logs, there were 11 logs in the fireplace.
- Kim adds 7 more logs to the fire.

Step 1: Find the total number of logs in the fireplace after Kim adds her logs.
Total number of logs = Number of logs after George added his logs + Number of logs added by Kim
Total number of logs = 11 + 7
Total number of logs = 18

Therefore, there are now 18 logs in total in the fireplace after Kim adds her logs.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the new information.

Given information:
- Initially, George added 10 logs to the fireplace.
- Then, George added 9 more logs to the fireplace.

Step 1: Find the total number of logs in the fireplace after the first addition.
Number of logs after the first addition = 10 logs

Step 2: Find the total number of logs in the fireplace after the second addition.
Number of logs after the second addition = Number of logs after the first addition + Number of logs added
Number of logs after the second addition = 10 + 9
Number of logs after the second addition = 19 logs

Therefore, in this scenario, there would have been a total of 19 logs in the fireplace.

Given information:
- The robot initially has 8 gears for moving.
- The manufacturer adds 4 more gears to improve its functionality.

To find the total number of gears, we need to add the initial number of gears and the number of gears added.

Total number of gears = Initial number of gears + Number of gears added
Total number of gears = 8 + 4
Total number of gears = 12

Therefore, after adding 4 more gears, the robot now has 12 gears.

Given information:
- Samantha has 5 tent poles.
- She needs an equal number of tent poles for her friend's tent.

Since Samantha needs an equal number of tent poles for her friend's tent, we can double the number of tent poles she already has.

Step 1: Find the number of tent poles needed for Samantha's friend's tent.
Number of tent poles needed for Samantha's friend's tent = Number of tent poles Samantha has
Number of tent poles needed for Samantha's friend's tent = 5

Step 2: Find the total number of tent poles needed for both tents.
Total number of tent poles needed = Number of tent poles Samantha has + Number of tent poles needed for Samantha's friend's tent

- After setting up both tents, she needs another set of 5 poles for a small storage tent.

Step 1: Find the number of tent poles needed for Samantha's tent and her friend's tent.
Number of tent poles needed for Samantha's tent = 5
Number of tent poles needed for her friend's tent = 5 (equal to Samantha's tent)
Total number of tent poles needed for both tents = 5 + 5 = 10

Step 2: Find the total number of tent poles needed, including the small storage tent.
Total number of tent poles needed = Number of tent poles needed for both tents + Number of tent poles needed for the small storage tent
Total number of tent poles needed = 10 + 5

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's consider the new scenario.

Given information:
- Sally initially starts with 1 snowball.
- John adds 11 snowballs to Sally's collection.

To find the total number of snowballs Sally has, we need to add the number of snowballs she started with and the number of snowballs John added.

Step 1: Add the number of snowballs Sally started with and the number of snowballs John added.
Sally's initial snowballs + John's added snowballs = Total number of snowballs
1 + 11 = 12

Therefore, if Sally initially started with 1 snowball and John added 11 snowballs to her collection, Sally would have a total of 12 snowballs for the snowball fight.

To find the total number of houses Max has now, we need to add the initial number of houses he had and the number of houses he inherited.

Step 1: Find the total number of houses Max has after inheriting the additional houses.
Total number of houses = Initial number of houses + Number of inherited houses
Total number of houses = 1 + 13

To find the total number of soccer cards Tommy has now, we need to add the number of cards Lucy gave him to the number of cards he already had.

Step 1: Find the total number of soccer cards Tommy has after receiving the cards from Lucy.
Total number of soccer cards = Number of soccer cards Tommy had before + Number of cards Lucy gave him
Total number of soccer cards = 14 + 4

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of apples Lisa has after starting with 1 apple, picking 6 more apples from her garden, and her mother bringing home 10 more apples.

Given information:
- Lisa started the day with 1 apple.
- Lisa picked 6 more apples from her garden.
- Lisa's mother brought home 10 more apples.

Step 1: Find the total number of apples Lisa has after picking 6 more apples from her garden.
Total number of apples after picking from the garden = Number of apples she started with + Number of apples picked from the garden
Total number of apples after picking from the garden = 1 + 6 = 7 apples

Step 2: Find the total number of apples Lisa has after her mother brought home 10 more apples.
Total number of apples = Number of apples after picking from the garden + Number of apples brought home by her mother

Given information:
- Peter originally had 6 candles.
- Mary gave him 5 more candles as a gift.

To find the total number of candles Peter has now, we need to add the number of candles he originally had to the number of candles he received as a gift.

Step 1: Find the total number of candles Peter has now.
Total number of candles = Initial number of candles + Number of candles received as a gift
Total number of candles = 6 + 5
Total number of candles = 11

Given information:
- The wizard casts the spell twice.
- Each time the spell is cast, it summons 4 mystical eagles.

Step 1: Find the number of mystical eagles summoned by the first spell.
Number of mystical eagles summoned by the first spell = 4

Step 2: Find the number of mystical eagles summoned by the second spell.
Number of mystical eagles summoned by the second spell = 4

Step 3: Find the total number of mystical eagles summoned by adding the number of eagles summoned by both spells.
Total number of mystical eagles summoned = Number of eagles summoned by the first spell + Number of eagles summoned by the second spell
Total number of mystical eagles summoned = 4 + 4 = 8

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* Initially, the wizard summoned 8 mystical eagles (from casting the spell twice, with each spell summoning 4 eagles)
* After the first round, the wizard cast two more spells
* Each of these two additional spells summoned 4 mystical eagles

To find the total number of mystical eagles summoned, we need to add the number of eagles summoned by the two new spells to the initial 8 eagles.

Number of eagles summoned by the first new spell = 4
Number of eagles summoned by the second new spell = 4

Total number of new eagles summoned = 4 + 4 = 8

Total number of mystical eagles summoned = Initial number of eagles + Number of new eagles
Total number of mystical eagles summoned = 8 + 8 = 16

Therefore, after the first round of the magic duel and casting two more spells, the wizard has summoned a total of 16 mystical eagles.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of gemstones Tommy has after receiving the additional gemstones from his teacher.

Given information:
- Initially, Tommy had 15 gemstones.
- His teacher gave him 5 more gemstones as a reward.

Step 1: Find the number of gemstones Tommy had initially.
Number of gemstones initially = 15

Step 2: Find the number of gemstones Tommy received from his teacher.
Number of gemstones received from the teacher = 5

Step 3: Find the total number of gemstones Tommy has now.
Total number of gemstones = Number of gemstones initially + Number of gemstones received from the teacher

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the new information.

Given information:
- Tommy initially found one precious gemstone on his way to school.
- Later, he found a treasure chest containing 19 gemstones.

Step 1: Find the number of gemstones Tommy had initially.
Number of gemstones initially = 1

Step 2: Find the number of gemstones Tommy found in the treasure chest.
Number of gemstones in the treasure chest = 19

Step 3: Find the total number of gemstones Tommy has now.
Total number of gemstones = Number of gemstones initially + Number of gemstones in the treasure chest
Total number of gemstones = 1 + 19
Total number of gemstones = 20

Therefore, if Tommy initially found one gemstone and then found a treasure chest containing 19 gemstones, he would have a total of 20 gemstones.

Given:
- The company originally produced 2 packs in the morning and 6 packs in the afternoon, which is a total of 8 packs per day.
- They will now produce an additional 8 packs in the evening.

To find the new total daily production, we need to add the original daily production to the additional evening production.

Step 1: Find the original daily production.
Original daily production = Morning production + Afternoon production
Original daily production = 2 packs + 6 packs
Original daily production = 8 packs

Step 2: Find the new total daily production by adding the additional evening production.
New total daily production = Original daily production + Additional evening production
New total daily production = 8 packs + 8 packs
New total daily production = 16 packs

Therefore, after increasing production by 8 extra packs in the evening, the marshmallow making company would produce a total of 16 packs of marshmallows daily.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of packs of marshmallows produced in the morning and afternoon with the new afternoon production.

Given information:
- The company produces 2 packs of marshmallows in the morning (unchanged).
- The company now produces 15 packs of marshmallows in the afternoon (instead of 6).

Step 1: Find the number of packs produced in the morning.
Number of packs produced in the morning = 2 packs (unchanged)

Step 2: Find the number of packs produced in the afternoon with the new production.
Number of packs produced in the afternoon = 15 packs

Step 3: Find the total number of packs produced in a day with the new afternoon production.
Total number of packs produced in a day = Number of packs produced in the morning + Number of packs produced in the afternoon
Total number of packs produced in a day = 2 packs + 15 packs
Total number of packs produced in a day = 17 packs

Therefore, with the new afternoon production of 15 packs, the marshmallow making company now produces 17 packs of marshmallows in a day, including their morning and afternoon production.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given information:
- Ella the monkey originally had 6 bananas.
- Ella found 13 more bananas in the jungle.

To find the total number of bananas Ella has, we need to add the number of bananas she originally had with the number of bananas she found in the jungle.

Step 1: Add the number of bananas Ella originally had with the number of bananas she found in the jungle.
Number of bananas Ella originally had + Number of bananas she found in the jungle = Total number of bananas Ella has now
6 + 13 = 19

Therefore, if Ella the monkey originally had 6 bananas before she found 13 more in the jungle, she would have a total of 19 bananas.

Given information:
- Marie initially had 8 ice skates in her collection.
- She received 7 more ice skates from the sports fair.
- After that, she received 3 more ice skates as a gift.

Step 1: Find the total number of ice skates after receiving the 7 ice skates from the sports fair.
Total number of ice skates after the sports fair = Initial number of ice skates + Number of ice skates received from the sports fair
Total number of ice skates after the sports fair = 8 + 7 = 15

Step 2: Find the total number of ice skates after receiving the 3 ice skates as a gift.
Total number of ice skates after the gift = Total number of ice skates after the sports fair + Number of ice skates received as a gift

Given information:
- Emily originally has 6 stuffed animals.
- She receives 14 more stuffed animals after her birthday party.

To find the total number of stuffed animals, we need to add the original number of stuffed animals to the number of new stuffed animals she received.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cars Ben has after buying 14 more cars.

Given information:
- Ben initially owns 4 cars.
- Ben buys 14 more cars.

Step 1: Find the total number of cars Ben has after buying the additional cars.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given:
- Initially, Ben had 4 cars.
- He bought 14 more cars, so he had 4 + 14 = 18 cars.
- He received another car as a gift from his friend.

To find the total number of cars Ben has now, we need to add the gifted car to the existing number of cars.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cars Ben had after buying 14 more cars.
Number of cars after buying 14 more = 4 + 14 = 18 cars

Step 2: Add the gifted car to the existing number of cars.
Total number of cars = Number of cars after buying 14 more + Gifted car
Total number of cars = 18 + 1 = 19 cars

Therefore, after receiving the gifted car from his friend, Ben now has a total of 19 cars in his collection.

To find the total number of jackets John has now, we need to add the number of jackets he initially had and the number of jackets he received as a gift.

Total number of jackets = Initial number of jackets + Number of jackets received as a gift
Total number of jackets = 12 + 4

To find the total number of snowballs, we need to add the number of snowballs used by Thomas and the number of decorative snowballs added by Lucy.

Total number of snowballs = Number of snowballs used by Thomas + Number of decorative snowballs added by Lucy

* The firefighter initially climbed a total distance of 18 feet to reach the people (from the previous question)
* After rescuing the people, he needs to go an additional distance equal to his own height (which is 2 feet) to get them onto a safe platform

To find the total distance the firefighter has traveled, we need to add the initial distance climbed (18 feet) and the additional distance to the safe platform (2 feet).

Total distance traveled = Initial distance climbed + Additional distance to safe platform
Total distance traveled = 18 feet + 2 feet
Total distance traveled = 20 feet

Therefore, the total distance the firefighter has traveled after rescuing the people and getting them onto a safe platform is 20 feet.

- The distance between the window and the people he needs to rescue is 13 feet (updated from 11 feet).

Step 1: Find the distance from the ground to the window.
Distance from the ground to the window = 5 feet + 2 feet (firefighter's height)
Distance from the ground to the window = 7 feet

Step 2: Find the total distance the firefighter needs to climb.
Total distance to climb = Distance from the ground to the window + Distance between the window and the people
Total distance to climb = 7 feet + 13 feet

    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this scenario, the only change is that Rebecca initially had 12 dolls instead of 10.

Given information:
- Rebecca initially has 12 dolls.
- Erica brings 6 of her own dolls.
- Erica also brings 2 additional dolls that she got as a gift.

Step 1: Find the total number of dolls Erica has.
Erica's dolls = Erica's own dolls + Additional dolls she got as a gift
Erica's dolls = 6 + 2 = 8 dolls

Step 2: Find the total number of dolls Rebecca and Erica have together.
Total dolls = Rebecca's initial dolls + Erica's dolls
Total dolls = 12 + 8 = 20 dolls

Therefore, if Rebecca initially had 12 dolls, they would be playing with a total of 20 dolls.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of performers that have been in the ring.

Given information:
- There are 4 elephants performing at the circus.
- After the elephants finish their performance, 1 clown comes into the ring.

Step 1: Find the number of performers initially in the ring.
Number of performers initially in the ring = Number of elephants
Number of performers initially in the ring = 4

Step 2: Find the number of performers after the clown enters the ring.
Number of performers after the clown enters the ring = Number of performers initially in the ring + Number of clowns
Number of performers after the clown enters the ring = 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, a total of 5 performers have been in the ring.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of bottles of milk Jeremy has after his mother buys additional bottles.

Given information:
- Jeremy initially has 5 bottles of milk in his fridge.
- Jeremy's mother buys 11 additional bottles of milk.

To find the total number of bottles, we need to add the initial number of bottles to the number of bottles bought.

Total number of bottles = Initial number of bottles + Number of bottles bought
Total number of bottles = 5 + 11
Total number of bottles = 16

Therefore, Jeremy now has 16 bottles of milk.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's take this step-by-step:
* Initially, Jeremy had 5 bottles of milk
* His mother bought 11 more bottles
* So after his mother's shopping, he had 5 + 11 = 16 bottles
* Then his friend brought over 3 more bottles
* So the new total is the previous total (16) plus the 3 bottles his friend brought
* 16 + 3 = 19

Therefore, after his friend's visit, Jeremy now has 19 bottles of milk.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of new insect species Liam discovered and then add it to the number of butterfly and bird species, and finally add the 10 more unique species he encountered later.

Given information:
- Liam found 2 new species of butterflies.
- Liam found 3 new species of birds.
- Liam discovered as many new insect species as the total number of bird and butterfly species combined.
- Liam encountered 10 more unique species later in the day.

Step 1: Find the total number of bird and butterfly species.
Total number of bird and butterfly species = 2 (butterflies) + 3 (birds) = 5 species

Step 2: Find the number of new insect species Liam discovered.
Number of new insect species = Total number of bird and butterfly species = 5 species

Step 3: Find the total number of species Liam discovered before encountering the 10 more unique species.
Total species before the 10 more unique species = Number of butterfly species + Number of bird species + Number of insect species
Total species before the 10 more unique species = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 species

Step 4: Find the total number of species Liam discovered during his day at the park.
Total species discovered = Total species before the 10 more unique species + 10 more unique species
Total species discovered = 10 + 10 = 20 species

Therefore, Liam discovered a total of 20 species during his day at the park.

- On the previous trip, Liam found 3 new species of birds.
- On the previous trip, Liam discovered as many new insect species as the total number of bird and butterfly species combined.
- On the second day, Liam encountered 4 more unique species.

Step 1: Find the total number of bird and butterfly species on the previous trip.
Total number of bird and butterfly species = 2 (butterflies) + 3 (birds) = 5 species

Step 2: Find the number of new insect species Liam discovered on the previous trip.
Number of new insect species = Total number of bird and butterfly species = 5 species

Step 3: Find the total number of species Liam discovered on the previous trip.
Total species on the previous trip = Number of butterfly species + Number of bird species + Number of insect species
Total species on the previous trip = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 species

Step 4: Find the total number of species Liam discovered during his second day at the park.
Total species discovered on the second day = Total species on the previous trip + 4 more unique species

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the number of cards Mike initially had to the number of cards he found on the ground.

Given information:
- Mike has 19 playing cards in his collection.
- Mike finds one more card on the ground.

Step 1: Find the number of cards Mike found on the ground.
Number of cards found on the ground = 1

Step 2: Find the total number of cards Mike has now.
Total number of cards = Initial number of cards + Number of cards found on the ground
Total number of cards = 19 + 1
Total number of cards = 20

Therefore, Mike now has 20 cards in his collection.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this new problem.

Given information:
- Mike initially had 2 playing cards in his collection.
- Mike found one more card on the ground.

Step 1: Find the number of cards Mike found on the ground.
Number of cards found on the ground = 1

Step 2: Find the total number of cards Mike has now.
Total number of cards = Initial number of cards + Number of cards found on the ground
Total number of cards = 2 + 1
Total number of cards = 3

Therefore, if Mike initially had 2 playing cards and then found one more card on the ground, he would now have 3 cards in his collection.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the number of leaves blown off the tree in each instance.

Given information:
- The first gust of wind blew off 1 leaf.
- The second gust of wind blew off 2 leaves.

Step 1: Find the total number of leaves blown off the tree.
Total leaves blown off = Leaves blown off in the first gust + Leaves blown off in the second gust
Total leaves blown off = 1 + 2
Total leaves blown off = 3

Therefore, the wind blew off a total of 3 leaves from the tree.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* First gust of wind blew off 1 leaf
* Second gust of wind blew off 2 more leaves
* Third (stronger) gust of wind blew off 9 more leaves

To find the total number of leaves blown off, we need to add up the leaves from each gust:

Leaves blown off in first gust: 1
Leaves blown off in second gust: 2
Leaves blown off in third gust: 9

Total leaves blown off = 1 + 2 + 9
                     = 12

Therefore, the total number of leaves blown off the tree by the wind is 12.

Given information:
- The wizard initially had 7 potions in his pantry.
- After brewing for a day, he has 13 more potions than before.

Step 1: Find the number of potions the wizard brewed during the day.
Number of potions brewed = 13 (since he has 13 more potions than before)

Step 2: Find the total number of potions the wizard has now.
Total number of potions = Initial number of potions + Number of potions brewed
Total number of potions = 7 + 13
Total number of potions = 20

Given information:
- The wizard initially had 3 potions in his pantry.

Step 1: Find the number of potions the wizard brewed during the day.
Number of potions brewed = 13 (since he has 13 more potions than before)

Step 2: Find the total number of potions the wizard has now.
Total number of potions = Initial number of potions + Number of potions brewed
Total number of potions = 3 + 13
Total number of potions = 16

Therefore, if the wizard had only 3 potions initially and brewed the same amount (13 more potions), he would now have 16 potions in his pantry.

- George then bought 4 more gallons of paint.

Step 1: Find the amount of paint George had after receiving the additional paint from Larry.
George's initial amount of paint + Additional paint from Larry = Total amount of paint after receiving additional paint
2 gallons + 2 gallons = 4 gallons

Step 2: Find the total amount of paint George has after buying 4 more gallons.
Total amount of paint after receiving additional paint + Amount of paint bought = Total amount of paint

- George then bought 7 more gallons of paint.

Step 1: Find the amount of paint George had after receiving the additional paint from Larry.
George's initial amount of paint + Additional paint from Larry = Total amount of paint after receiving additional paint
2 gallons + 2 gallons = 4 gallons

Step 2: Find the total amount of paint George has after buying 7 more gallons.
Total amount of paint after receiving additional paint + Amount of paint bought = Total amount of paint

To find the total number of tomatoes Ramesh has now, we need to add the number of tomatoes he already had to the number of tomatoes his mom gave him.

Step 1: Find the number of tomatoes Ramesh had initially.
Number of tomatoes Ramesh had initially = 2

Step 2: Find the number of tomatoes Ramesh's mom gave him.
Number of tomatoes Ramesh's mom gave him = 16

Step 3: Find the total number of tomatoes Ramesh has now.
Total number of tomatoes Ramesh has now = Number of tomatoes Ramesh had initially + Number of tomatoes Ramesh's mom gave him
Total number of tomatoes Ramesh has now = 2 + 16 = 18

Number of tomatoes Ramesh has initially = 4

Step 2: Find the number of tomatoes Suresh gives to Ramesh.
Number of tomatoes Suresh gives to Ramesh = 1

Step 3: Find the total number of tomatoes Ramesh has now.
Total number of tomatoes Ramesh has now = Number of tomatoes Ramesh has initially + Number of tomatoes Suresh gives to Ramesh

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the new values.

Given information:
- The farmer originally had 9 cows.
- The neighbor gifted the farmer 2 more cows.

Step 1: Add the number of cows the farmer originally had with the number of cows gifted by the neighbor.
Number of cows the farmer now has = Initial number of cows + Number of cows gifted
Number of cows the farmer now has = 9 + 2
Number of cows the farmer now has = 11

Therefore, with the new values, the farmer now has a total of 11 cows.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the number of cookies Liam baked in the morning and the number of cookies he baked in the evening.

Given information:
- Liam baked 4 cookies in the morning.
- Liam baked 10 more cookies in the evening.

Step 1: Find the total number of cookies Liam baked.
Total number of cookies = Number of cookies baked in the morning + Number of cookies baked in the evening
Total number of cookies = 4 + 10
Total number of cookies = 14

Therefore, Liam baked a total of 14 cookies.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's take the previous information and add the new detail.

Previously, Liam had baked:
- 4 cookies in the morning
- 10 cookies in the evening
- Total of 14 cookies

Now, Liam baked 2 more cookies as a midnight snack.

To find the new total, we add the 2 new cookies to the previous total:
Previous total: 14 cookies
New cookies baked: 2 cookies
New total = 14 + 2 = 16 cookies

Therefore, after baking the midnight snack cookies, Liam has baked a total of 16 cookies.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of parts Dr. Fusion has after receiving the second shipment.

Given information:
- Dr. Fusion initially had 7 parts for building the rocket.
- He received another shipment with 7 more parts.

To find the total number of parts, we need to add the initial number of parts and the number of parts received in the second shipment.

Total number of parts = Initial number of parts + Number of parts received in the second shipment
Total number of parts = 7 + 7
Total number of parts = 14

Therefore, Dr. Fusion has a total of 14 parts for his rocket now.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* Initially, Dr. Fusion had 7 parts
* He received another shipment of 7 parts, so he had 7 + 7 = 14 parts
* Now, he receives an extra 5 parts

To find the total number of parts he has now, we need to add the extra 5 parts to the 14 parts he already had:

Total parts = Parts he had before + Extra parts received
Total parts = 14 + 5
Total parts = 19

Therefore, after receiving the extra 5 parts, Dr. Fusion now has a total of 19 parts for his rocket.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">In this problem, we need to find the total number of parts Dr. Fusion would have if he started with 7 rocket parts and added 5 more parts.

Given information:
- Dr. Fusion initially had 7 rocket parts.
- He added 5 more parts.

To find the total number of parts, we need to add the initial number of parts and the number of parts added.

Total number of parts = Initial number of parts + Number of parts added
Total number of parts = 7 + 5
Total number of parts = 12

Therefore, if Dr. Fusion had originally started with 7 rocket parts and added 5 more parts, he would have a total of 12 parts for his rocket now.

Given information:
- Timmy initially has 4 giraffes.
- He gets the same amount of giraffes he already had.
- He then adds the amount of giraffes he originally had.

Step 1: Find the number of giraffes Timmy gets.
Number of giraffes Timmy gets = Number of giraffes he initially had
Number of giraffes Timmy gets = 4 giraffes

Step 2: Find the total number of giraffes after getting the same amount.
Total number of giraffes = Initial number of giraffes + Number of giraffes he gets
Total number of giraffes = 4 + 4 = 8 giraffes

Step 3: Add the amount of giraffes he originally had to the total.
Final number of giraffes = Total number of giraffes + Initial number of giraffes
Final number of giraffes = 8 + 4 = 12 giraffes

Therefore, Timmy now has 12 giraffes.
