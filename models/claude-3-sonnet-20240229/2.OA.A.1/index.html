        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of roller skates that are not for children, which will be the number of roller skates for adults.

Given information:
- Harvey has a total of 70 roller skates in his shop.
- 42 of those roller skates are for children.

Step 1: Find the number of roller skates that are not for children.
Total number of roller skates - Number of roller skates for children = Number of roller skates for adults
70 - 42 = 28

Therefore, Harvey has 28 roller skates for adults in his shop.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the initial number of dogs and the number of dogs remaining after the relocation.

Given information:
- The town initially had 98 dogs.
- After some dogs relocated, there were 73 dogs remaining.

Step 1: Find the number of dogs that relocated.
Number of dogs that relocated = Initial number of dogs - Number of dogs remaining
Number of dogs that relocated = 98 - 73
Number of dogs that relocated = 25

Therefore, 25 dogs relocated from the town.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of the pirate ship without the cargo.

Given information:
- The weight of the pirate ship with all the crew members and cargo is 78 tons.
- The weight of the cargo is 74 tons.

To find the weight of the pirate ship with just the crew, we need to subtract the weight of the cargo from the total weight of the ship with all the crew members and cargo.

Weight of the pirate ship with just the crew = Total weight of the ship with all the crew members and cargo - Weight of the cargo
Weight of the pirate ship with just the crew = 78 tons - 74 tons
Weight of the pirate ship with just the crew = 4 tons

Therefore, the weight of the pirate ship with just the crew is 4 tons.

Given information:
- Sam initially had 22 strings for his kites.
- After adding more strings, Sam has a total of 41 strings.

Step 1: Find the number of extra strings Sam added to his collection.
Number of extra strings added = Total number of strings after adding - Initial number of strings
Number of extra strings added = 41 - 22
Number of extra strings added = 19

Therefore, Sam added 19 extra strings to his collection.

Given information:
- The UFO left 82 crop circles in the field.
- 34 crop circles have already been found.

Step 1: Find the number of crop circles yet to be discovered.
Number of crop circles yet to be discovered = Total number of crop circles - Number of crop circles already found
Number of crop circles yet to be discovered = 82 - 34
Number of crop circles yet to be discovered = 48

Therefore, we are yet to discover 48 crop circles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the value of 'b', which represents the additional time John spent to finish the puzzle.

Given information:
- John spends 7 hours working on the puzzle initially.
- He takes an additional amount of time 'b' to finish the puzzle completely.
- Altogether, he spends 13 hours working on the puzzle.

We can represent this information using an equation:
7 + b = 13

Rearranging the equation to find the value of 'b':
b = 13 - 7
b = 6

Therefore, John spent an additional 6 hours to finish the puzzle completely.

- The bear's goal is to eat 92 pounds of food.

Step 1: Find the difference between the bear's goal and the amount of food it has already eaten.
Bear's goal - Amount of food already eaten = Amount of food needed
92 pounds - 89 pounds = t

Step 2: Simplify the expression.
t = 92 pounds - 89 pounds
t = 3 pounds

Therefore, the bear needs to eat 3 more pounds of food to reach its goal of 92 pounds.

Given information:
- Emily initially had 98 stuffed animals.
- After giving some to her friend, she was left with 95 stuffed animals.

Step 1: Find the number of stuffed animals Emily gave to her friend.
Number of stuffed animals given to her friend = Initial number of stuffed animals - Number of stuffed animals left
Number of stuffed animals given to her friend = 98 - 95
Number of stuffed animals given to her friend = 3

Therefore, Emily gave 3 stuffed animals to her friend.

Given information:
- Jack lost 64 building blocks.
- After losing 64 building blocks, he is left with 24 building blocks.

Let's represent the initial number of building blocks as x.

We know that the initial number of building blocks minus the number of building blocks lost is equal to the remaining number of building blocks.

x - 64 = 24

To find x, we need to add 64 to both sides of the equation.

x - 64 + 64 = 24 + 64
x = 88

Given information:
- The music album has a total of 40 songs.
- After subtracting the number of romantic songs from the total, there are 20 songs left.

Let's represent the number of romantic songs as x.

Total songs = Romantic songs + Non-romantic songs
40 = x + (40 - x)
40 = x + 40 - x
40 = 40
0 = 0 (This equation is true for any value of x)

However, we know that after subtracting the number of romantic songs from the total, there are 20 songs left.
Non-romantic songs = 40 - x = 20
40 - x = 20
x = 40 - 20
x = 20

Therefore, the number of romantic songs in the album is 20.

Given information:
- The shop sold 36 sleeping bags.
- After selling 36 sleeping bags, they are left with 35 sleeping bags.

After selling 36 sleeping bags, the remaining number of sleeping bags is (a - 36).

We know that the remaining number of sleeping bags is 35.

Therefore, we can write the equation:
a - 36 = 35

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the desired total number of books and the current number of books the doctor has.

Given information:
- The doctor currently has 47 medical books.
- The doctor wants her collection to add up to a total of 33 more books.

Step 1: Find the desired total number of books.
Desired total number of books = Current number of books + 33
Desired total number of books = 47 + 33 = 80 books

Step 2: Find the number of books the doctor needs to achieve the desired collection size.
Number of books needed = Desired total number of books - Current number of books
Number of books needed = 80 - 47 = 33 books

Therefore, the doctor needs to acquire 33 more medical books to achieve her desired collection size.

Given information:
- The store has a total of 41 beach balls.
- 15 of the beach balls are blue.

Since the beach balls are either green or blue, we can find the number of green beach balls by subtracting the number of blue beach balls from the total number of beach balls.

Number of green beach balls = Total number of beach balls - Number of blue beach balls
Number of green beach balls = 41 - 15
Number of green beach balls = 26

Given information:
- The sun's angle above the horizon is initially 'j' degrees.
- After decreasing the angle by 24 degrees, it becomes 52 degrees.

Let's represent the original angle as 'j'.
After decreasing the angle by 24 degrees, the new angle is 'j - 24'.

We know that the new angle is 52 degrees.
Therefore, we can write the equation:
j - 24 = 52

To find the value of 'j', we need to add 24 to both sides of the equation:
j - 24 + 24 = 52 + 24
j = 76

Therefore, the original angle of the sun above the horizon was 76 degrees.

Given information:
- After selling 46 hats, the hat maker is left with 32 hats.

Let's represent the initial number of hats as x.

Initial number of hats = x
Number of hats sold = 46
Number of hats remaining = 32

We know that the initial number of hats minus the number of hats sold is equal to the number of hats remaining.

x - 46 = 32

We can represent the initial amount of water 'g' as the sum of the remaining amount of water (40 gallons) and the amount of water removed (3 gallons).

g = Remaining amount of water + Amount of water removed

x = 41 + 47
x = 88

Therefore, Jason initially had 88 building blocks in his cabinet.

Given information:
- The pirate found a treasure chest with 58 gold coins.
- The pirate gave 44 gold coins to his loyal parrot.

Step 1: Find the number of gold coins the pirate has left.
Number of gold coins left = Total number of gold coins - Number of gold coins given to the parrot
Number of gold coins left = 58 - 44
Number of gold coins left = 14

Therefore, the pirate has 14 gold coins left.

Given information:
- Amy has 75 skirts in her wardrobe.
- 18 of those skirts are red.

To find the number of skirts that are not red, we need to subtract the number of red skirts from the total number of skirts.

Step 1: Find the number of skirts that are not red.
Number of skirts that are not red = Total number of skirts - Number of red skirts
Number of skirts that are not red = 75 - 18

Given information:
- After removing 8 beds for repair, there were 72 beds left.

Let's represent the original number of beds as x.

Since 8 beds were removed, we can write the equation:
x - 8 = 72

Solving for x:
x - 8 = 72
x = 72 + 8
x = 80

Let's represent the original number of dinosaurs as 97 and the total number of dinosaurs after adding 'k' as (97 + k).

According to the given information, we have:

After donating 5 dolls, the number of dolls left is x - 5.

We know that x - 5 = 52 (since she has 52 dolls left after donating 5 dolls).

To find x, we need to add 5 to both sides of the equation:

            <span class="response-field">Claude-3 Sonnet:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of sheets and the number of stickers, and then use the given information to set up an equation.

Given information:
- The teacher initially had 'a' sheets of star stickers.
- She used 60 stickers for rewarding her students.
- She has 2 sheets left.

Let's assume that each sheet has 'x' stickers.

Step 1: Find the total number of stickers the teacher initially had.
Total number of stickers = Number of sheets Ã— Number of stickers per sheet
Total number of stickers = a Ã— x

Step 2: Find the number of stickers remaining after using 60 stickers.
Number of stickers remaining = Total number of stickers - Number of stickers used
Number of stickers remaining = (a Ã— x) - 60

Step 3: Find the number of stickers in the remaining 2 sheets.
Number of stickers in the remaining 2 sheets = 2 Ã— x

Step 4: Set up an equation by equating the number of stickers remaining to the number of stickers in the remaining 2 sheets.
(a Ã— x) - 60 = 2x

Step 5: Solve the equation for 'a'.
a Ã— x - 60 = 2x
a Ã— x - 2x = 60
(a - 2)x = 60
x = 60 / (a - 2)

Since we know that the teacher has 2 sheets left, we can substitute x = 2 into the equation.
2 = 60 / (a - 2)
a - 2 = 30
a = 32

Therefore, the teacher initially had 32 sheets of star stickers in her drawer.

Given information:
- The teacher started with 67 pencils.
- After some were lost, the teacher had 10 pencils left.

Step 1: Find the number of pencils lost.
Number of pencils lost = Initial number of pencils - Remaining number of pencils
Number of pencils lost = 67 - 10
Number of pencils lost = 57

Therefore, the teacher lost 57 pencils.

Given information:
- The backpack originally had some items inside.
- An additional 69 items were added to the backpack.
- The total number of items in the backpack now is 72.

Let's represent the number of items initially in the backpack as x.

We know that the total number of items in the backpack is the sum of the initial items and the additional items added.

Total items = Initial items + Additional items added
72 = x + 69

Rearranging the equation, we get:
x = 72 - 69
x = 3

Therefore, there were initially 3 items in the backpack.

Given information:
- After selling 39 cows, the farmer is left with 55 cows.

Let's represent the initial number of cows as x.

Since the farmer sold 39 cows, the remaining number of cows is x - 39.
We know that the remaining number of cows is 55.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x - 39 = 55

Solving for x:
x - 39 + 39 = 55 + 39
x = 94

Therefore, the farmer had 94 cows to start with.

Given information:
- The final wind speed after the decrease is 29 mph.
- The decrease in wind speed is 35 mph.

Let's represent the initial wind speed as x.

Since the decrease in wind speed is 35 mph, we can write the equation:
x - 35 = 29

Rearranging the equation to find x:
x = 29 + 35
x = 64

Given information:
- David has a total of 79 piano keys.
- Among the 79 keys, 46 are white keys.

To find the number of black keys, we need to subtract the number of white keys from the total number of keys.

Number of black keys = Total number of keys - Number of white keys
Number of black keys = 79 - 46
Number of black keys = 33

Given information:
- Initially, there were s animals at the zoo.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the initial number of moons and the final number of moons.

Given information:
- Initially, the planet had 69 moons.
- After further exploration, the total number of moons became 91.

Step 1: Find the number of additional moons discovered.
Number of additional moons = Final number of moons - Initial number of moons
Number of additional moons = 91 - 69
Number of additional moons = 22

Therefore, the astronaut discovered 22 more moons.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 99 toothbrushes in the dental clinic.
- After distributing some toothbrushes, there are 20 toothbrushes left.

Let's represent the number of toothbrushes distributed as x.

Initial number of toothbrushes = Number of toothbrushes distributed + Number of toothbrushes left

Given information:
- Initially, there were 'p' flowers in the garden.
- 21 flowers wilted.
- Now, there are 11 flowers left in the garden.

We can represent the current number of flowers as the initial number of flowers minus the number of flowers that wilted.

Let's denote the current number of flowers as 'c'.

c = p - 21 (since 21 flowers wilted)

We know that the current number of flowers is 11.

c = 11

Substituting the value of 'c' in the equation above, we get:

11 = p - 21
p = 11 + 21
p = 32

Therefore, there were initially 32 flowers in the garden.

Given information:
- After 17 students have alighted (got off) from the bus, there are 56 students still seated.

Let's represent the total number of students initially on the bus as x.

Since 17 students alighted, the remaining number of students on the bus is x - 17.
We know that the remaining number of students is 56.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x - 17 = 56

Let's represent the initial number of bars of soap as f.

Since 9 bars were donated, the remaining number of bars is the initial number minus 9.
Remaining number of bars = Initial number of bars - Bars donated
81 = f - 9

We know that the total number of oranges is the sum of the oranges from the first tree and the oranges from the other tree.

Total oranges = Oranges from the first tree + Oranges from the other tree
72 = 57 + x

- Initially, there were 73 sharks in the ocean.
- Later, some more sharks joined them, and the total number of sharks became 94.

Step 1: Find the number of sharks that joined later.
Number of sharks that joined later = Final number of sharks - Initial number of sharks
Number of sharks that joined later = 94 - 73
Number of sharks that joined later = 21

Therefore, 21 sharks joined the initial group of sharks later.

Given information:
- After selling 27 hats, there were 25 hats left in the store.

Let's represent the initial number of hats as z.

Since the store sold 27 hats, the remaining number of hats is the initial number minus the number of hats sold.

Remaining number of hats = Initial number of hats - Number of hats sold
25 = z - 27

Rearranging the equation to find z:
z = 25 + 27
z = 52

Therefore, the store initially had 52 hats before selling 27 hats.

Step 1: Subtract the length of the decorative border from the total length of the blanket.
Length of the main part of the blanket = Total length of the blanket - Length of the decorative border
Length of the main part of the blanket = 96 inches - 39 inches
Length of the main part of the blanket = 57 inches

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the final number of pairs of roller skates and the initial number of pairs.

Given information:
- The roller skating rink initially had 44 pairs of roller skates.
- After purchasing new pairs, the rink now has 71 pairs of roller skates.

Step 1: Find the number of new pairs of roller skates purchased.
Number of new pairs purchased = Final number of pairs - Initial number of pairs
Number of new pairs purchased = 71 - 44
Number of new pairs purchased = 27

Therefore, the roller skating rink bought 27 new pairs of roller skates.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the total count of starfish and the initial count of starfish.

Given information:
- The beachcomber initially found 58 starfish.
- The total count of starfish after finding more later in the day is 69.

Step 1: Find the number of additional starfish found later in the day.
Additional starfish found = Total count of starfish - Initial count of starfish
Additional starfish found = 69 - 58
Additional starfish found = 11

Therefore, the beachcomber found 11 additional starfish later in the day.
