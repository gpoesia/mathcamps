        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation 122 = 92 + 28 * u for the variable u, we need to isolate u on one side of the equation.

Given equation: 122 = 92 + 28 * u

Step 1: Subtract 92 from both sides of the equation.
122 - 92 = 92 + 28 * u - 92
30 = 28 * u

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 28.
30 / 28 = 28 * u / 28
u = 30 / 28

Step 3: Simplify the fraction on the right-hand side.
u = 15 / 14

Therefore, the solution to the equation 122 = 92 + 28 * u is u = 15 / 14.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation for the value of 'l', we need to isolate 'l' on one side of the equation.

Given equation: 138 = 43 + 25 * l

Step 1: Subtract 43 from both sides of the equation.
138 - 43 = 43 + 25 * l - 43
95 = 25 * l

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 25.
95 / 25 = 25 * l / 25
3.8 = l

Therefore, the value of 'l' is 3.8.

Given equation: 80 = ((24 * w) + 35)

Step 1: Subtract 35 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term (24 * w).
80 - 35 = (24 * w) + 35 - 35
45 = 24 * w

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 24 to find the value of w.
45 / 24 = 24 * w / 24
w = 45 / 24
w = 1.875

Therefore, the value of the unknown w that satisfies the equation 80 = ((24 * w) + 35) is 1.875.

Given equation: 77 = (33 + (14 * x))

Step 1: Remove the parentheses by distributing the multiplication.
77 = 33 + 14x

Step 2: Subtract 33 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x.
77 - 33 = 33 + 14x - 33
44 = 14x

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 14 to find the value of x.
44/14 = 14x/14
x = 44/14
x = 3.14285714286

Therefore, the value of x that satisfies the equation 77 = (33 + (14 * x)) is approximately 3.14.

129 - 66 = 26 * m + 66 - 66
63 = 26 * m

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 26 to isolate m.
63 / 26 = 26 * m / 26
m = 63 / 26

Step 3: Simplify the fraction on the right-hand side.
63 / 26 = 2 (with a remainder of 11)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation 157 = 53 * i + 61 for the variable i, we need to isolate i on one side of the equation by performing inverse operations.

Step 1: Subtract 61 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term.
157 - 61 = 53 * i + 61 - 61
96 = 53 * i

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 53 to isolate i.
96 / 53 = 53 * i / 53
i = 96 / 53
i = 1.8113207547169812 (approximately)

Therefore, the solution to the linear equation 157 = 53 * i + 61 is i = 1.8113207547169812.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation 71 = ((24 * q) + 14) for the value of q, we need to isolate q on one side of the equation.

Step 1: Subtract 14 from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term.
71 - 14 = (24 * q) + 14 - 14
57 = 24 * q

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 24 to isolate q.
57 / 24 = 24 * q / 24
q = 57 / 24

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.
q = (57 / 3) / (24 / 3)
q = 19 / 8

Therefore, the value of q that satisfies the linear equation 71 = ((24 * q) + 14) is q = 19 / 8.

82 = (70 * e)

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of e, which is 70.
82 / 70 = (70 * e) / 70
(82 / 70) = e

Step 3: Perform the division to find the value of e.
(82 / 70) = 1.1714285714285715

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation for the unknown variable a, we need to isolate a on one side of the equation.

Given equation: 103 = ((38 * a) + 51)

Step 1: Subtract 51 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable a.
103 - 51 = (38 * a) + 51 - 51
52 = 38 * a

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 38 to get the value of a.
52 / 38 = (38 * a) / 38
a = 52 / 38

Step 3: Evaluate the division to find the value of a.
a = 1.368421...

Therefore, the value of the unknown variable a in the equation 103 = ((38 * a) + 51) is approximately 1.368421.

Given equation: 105 = 28 * f + 8

Step 1: Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with f.
105 - 8 = 28 * f + 8 - 8
97 = 28 * f

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 28 to find the value of f.
97 / 28 = 28 * f / 28
f = 97 / 28
f = 3.464285714285714

Therefore, the value of f in the equation 105 = 28 * f + 8 is approximately 3.464285714285714.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the value of r, we need to rearrange the equation and isolate r on one side.

Given equation: 38 = 81 - 36r

Step 1: Subtract 81 from both sides of the equation.
38 - 81 = 81 - 36r - 81
-43 = -36r

Step 2: Divide both sides by -36 to isolate r.
-43/-36 = -36r/-36
r = 43/36
r = 1.194444...

Therefore, the value of r in the linear equation 38 = 81 - 36r is approximately 1.19.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the equation 90 = (23 + (56 * a)), we need to isolate the variable 'a' on one side of the equation.

Given equation: 90 = (23 + (56 * a))

Step 1: Remove the parentheses by distributing the multiplication.
90 = 23 + 56a

Step 2: Subtract 23 from both sides of the equation.
90 - 23 = 56a
67 = 56a

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 56 to isolate 'a'.
67/56 = 56a/56
a = 67/56
a = 1.196428571

Therefore, the value of 'a' that satisfies the equation 90 = (23 + (56 * a)) is approximately 1.196428571.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation for the value of n, we need to perform the following steps:

Step 1: Simplify the right-hand side of the equation by performing the operations inside the parentheses.
56 = 82 - (4 Ã— n)
56 = 82 - 4n

Step 2: Subtract 82 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with n.
56 - 82 = -4n
-26 = -4n

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by -4 to find the value of n.
-26/-4 = n
6.5 = n

Therefore, the value of n that satisfies the linear equation 56 = (82 - (4 Ã— n)) is 6.5.

-79 = -15x

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by -15 to isolate x.

j = 53 / 11
j = 4.818181818181818

Therefore, the value of j in the equation 57 = ((11 * j) + 4) is approximately 4.818181818181818.

Given equation: 67 = 21 + 9*x

Step 1: Subtract 21 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x.
67 - 21 = 21 + 9*x - 21
46 = 9*x

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 9 to get x alone.
46/9 = 9*x/9
x = 46/9

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.
x = (46/2) / (9/2)
x = 23/4.5
x = 5.11 (approximately)

Therefore, the value of x that satisfies the equation 67 = 21 + 9*x is approximately 5.11.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the linear equation for the variable g, we need to isolate g on one side of the equation.

Given equation: 145 = (50 + (91 * g))

Step 1: Subtract 50 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with g.
145 - 50 = (50 + (91 * g)) - 50
95 = 91 * g

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 91 to get the value of g.
95 / 91 = (91 * g) / 91
g = 1.044

Therefore, the value of g that satisfies the given linear equation is 1.044.

Given equation: 123 = ((44 * l) + 73)

Step 1: Subtract 73 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with l.
123 - 73 = (44 * l) + 73 - 73
50 = 44 * l

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 44 to get the value of l.
50 / 44 = 44 * l / 44
l = 50 / 44
l = 25 / 22

Therefore, the value of l in the given linear equation is 25/22 or approximately 1.136.

90 = 19 * q

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 19.
90/19 = (19 * q)/19
4.7368421... = q

Step 1: Isolate the term containing the variable g on one side of the equation.

149 - 62 = (18 * g) + 62 - 62
87 = 18 * g

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 18 to find the value of g.
87 / 18 = 18 * g / 18
g = 87 / 18
g = 4.83 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the value of g in the equation 149 = ((18 * g) + 62) is approximately 4.83.
