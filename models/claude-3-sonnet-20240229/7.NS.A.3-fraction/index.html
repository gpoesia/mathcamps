        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the initial number of cucumbers per plant and then multiply it by the adjustment factor (23/17).

Given information:
- The initial number of cucumbers per plant is determined by multiplying 22/3 by 22/19.
- The production is adjusted by multiplying the initial amount by 23/17.

Step 1: Find the initial number of cucumbers per plant.
Initial number of cucumbers per plant = (22/3) Ã— (22/19)
Initial number of cucumbers per plant = (484/57)
Initial number of cucumbers per plant = 8.49 (approximately)

Step 2: Find the adjusted number of cucumbers per plant.
Adjusted number of cucumbers per plant = Initial number of cucumbers per plant Ã— (23/17)
Adjusted number of cucumbers per plant = 8.49 Ã— (23/17)
Adjusted number of cucumbers per plant = 11.47 (approximately)

Therefore, after adjusting her production method, Carla is expecting to grow approximately 11.47 cucumbers per plant.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of grapes Pierre has after eating some and receiving more from his mother.

Given information:
- Pierre initially had 19/4 kg of grapes.
- He ate 7/25 kg of grapes in the afternoon.
- His mother gave him 30/9 kg more grapes in the evening.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
19/4 = (19 Ã— 25)/100 = 475/100 kg
7/25 = 7/25 kg
30/9 = (30 Ã— 25)/225 = 750/225 kg

Step 2: Find the amount of grapes Pierre had after eating some.
Initial amount of grapes - Amount eaten = Amount remaining
475/100 kg - 7/25 kg = (475/100 - 28/100) kg = 447/100 kg

Step 3: Find the total amount of grapes Pierre has now after receiving more from his mother.
Amount remaining + Amount received = Total amount
447/100 kg + 750/225 kg = (447 Ã— 225 + 750 Ã— 100) / (100 Ã— 225) kg
                         = 100,575/22,500 kg
                         = 4.47 kg

Therefore, Pierre now has 4.47 kg of grapes.

            King Arthur is calculating the costs for restoring his castle. The wall repairs cost 26/22 of his castle's annual budget. Meanwhile, the moat renovations cost an additional 4/29 of the budget. Finally, installing new defensive catapults takes up an 11/3 portion of the budget. How much (expressed as a fraction of the castle's annual budget) has King Arthur spent on these projects in total?
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the fractions representing the costs of each project.

Given information:
- Wall repairs cost 26/22 of the castle's annual budget.
- Moat renovations cost 4/29 of the budget.
- Installing new defensive catapults takes up 11/3 of the budget.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) for all the fractions.
LCD = 462 (the least common multiple of 22, 29, and 3)

Step 2: Convert all fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
Wall repairs cost = (26/22) Ã— (21/21) = 546/462
Moat renovations cost = (4/29) Ã— (16/16) = 64/462
Installing new defensive catapults cost = (11/3) Ã— (154/154) = 1694/462

Step 3: Add the fractions.
Total cost = (546/462) + (64/462) + (1694/462)
            = 2304/462

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
2304/462 = 5 (by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 462)

Therefore, King Arthur has spent 5 portions of the castle's annual budget on these projects in total.

            A giraffe at the local zoo has a peculiar eating habit. When it is fed 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves, it eats 30/26 times more than what it usually does in a day. If the zoo calculates the weekly feeding amount by multiplying the daily intake by itself (making the result &quot;weekly feeding amount squared&quot;) and then multiplying that with the regular daily intake, how many pounds of acacia leaves should they prepare for the giraffe for a week?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow the given steps and perform the required calculations.

Given information:
- The giraffe eats 25/19 lbs of acacia leaves, which is 30/26 times more than its usual daily intake.
- The weekly feeding amount is calculated by multiplying the daily intake by itself (squaring it) and then multiplying that with the regular daily intake.

Step 1: Calculate the daily intake of the giraffe.
Daily intake = (25/19) * (30/26)
Daily intake = (25 * 30) / (19 * 26)
Daily intake = 750 / 494
Daily intake = 1.518 lbs

Step 2: Calculate the weekly feeding amount squared.
Weekly feeding amount squared = (Daily intake)^2
Weekly feeding amount squared = (1.518)^2
Weekly feeding amount squared = 2.304

Step 3: Calculate the weekly feeding amount by multiplying the weekly feeding amount squared with the daily intake.
Weekly feeding amount = Weekly feeding amount squared * Daily intake
Weekly feeding amount = 2.304 * 1.518
Weekly feeding amount = 3.499 lbs

Therefore, the zoo should prepare 3.499 lbs of acacia leaves for the giraffe for a week.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the length of yarn required for the necklace and the additional length due to the smaller beads.

Given information:
- The necklace requires (11/3) feet of yarn.
- The smaller beads will extend the length of the necklace by (8/30) feet.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
(11/3) = (110/30) feet of yarn
(8/30) feet for the smaller beads

Step 2: Add the lengths together.
Length of yarn + Length of smaller beads = Total length of materials needed
(110/30) + (8/30) = 118/30 feet

Step 3: Convert the fraction to a mixed number or decimal form for better understanding.
118/30 = 3 (28/30) feet
118/30 = 3.93 feet

Therefore, Lara will need 3.93 feet or 3 (28/30) feet of materials to make the necklace.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the distance traveled by each plane after one minute and then calculate the difference between them.

Given information:
- Plane A is flying at a speed of 24/11 miles per minute.
- Plane B is flying at a speed of 26/27 miles per minute.

Step 1: Find the distance traveled by Plane A after one minute.
Distance traveled by Plane A = Speed of Plane A Ã— Time
Distance traveled by Plane A = (24/11) miles per minute Ã— 1 minute
Distance traveled by Plane A = 24/11 miles

Step 2: Find the distance traveled by Plane B after one minute.
Distance traveled by Plane B = Speed of Plane B Ã— Time
Distance traveled by Plane B = (26/27) miles per minute Ã— 1 minute
Distance traveled by Plane B = 26/27 miles

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the distances traveled by Plane A and Plane B.
Difference = Distance traveled by Plane A - Distance traveled by Plane B
Difference = (24/11) - (26/27) miles

To find the difference, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.
The least common multiple of 11 and 27 is 297.

(24/11) = (24 Ã— 27/297)
(24/11) = 648/297

(26/27) = (26 Ã— 11/297)
(26/27) = 286/297

Difference = (648/297) - (286/297)
Difference = 362/297 miles

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 362 and 297 is 1.

Given information:
- Plane A is now flying at a speed of 24/11 miles per minute.
- Plane B is now flying at a speed of 2/27 miles per minute.

Step 1: Find the distance traveled by Plane A after one minute with the new speed.
Distance traveled by Plane A = Speed of Plane A Ã— Time
Distance traveled by Plane A = (24/11) miles per minute Ã— 1 minute
Distance traveled by Plane A = 24/11 miles

Step 2: Find the distance traveled by Plane B after one minute with the new speed.
Distance traveled by Plane B = Speed of Plane B Ã— Time
Distance traveled by Plane B = (2/27) miles per minute Ã— 1 minute
Distance traveled by Plane B = 2/27 miles

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the distances traveled by Plane A and Plane B.
Difference = Distance traveled by Plane A - Distance traveled by Plane B
Difference = (24/11) - (2/27) miles

To find the difference, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions.
The least common multiple of 11 and 27 is 297.

(24/11) = (24 Ã— 27/297)
(24/11) = 648/297

(2/27) = (2 Ã— 11/297)
(2/27) = 22/297

Difference = (648/297) - (22/297)

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the combined amount that both bears eat per day, we need to multiply 14/7 by 25/13.

First, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions 14/7 and 25/13. The least common multiple of 7 and 13 is 91.

So, we convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 91:
14/7 = (14 Ã— 13)/91 = 182/91
25/13 = (25 Ã— 7)/91 = 175/91

Now, we can multiply the fractions:
(182/91) Ã— (175/91) = (182 Ã— 175) / (91 Ã— 91) = 31,850 / 8,281 = 3.845...

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 11.
31,850 / 11 = 2,895
8,281 / 11 = 753

Therefore, the combined amount that both bears eat per day is 2,895/753 pounds of fish.

Given information:
- Toby's first song takes 12/8 hours to play.
- Toby's second song takes 12/3 hours to play.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of 8 and 3.
The LCD of 8 and 3 is 24.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
12/8 hours = (12/8) Ã— (3/3) = 36/24 hours
12/3 hours = (12/3) Ã— (8/8) = 96/24 hours

Step 3: Add the fractions.
(36/24) + (96/24) = 132/24 hours

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 132 and 24 is 12.
132/24 = (132/12) / (24/12) = 11/2 hours

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the times it takes Toby to play all three songs, and then simplify the resulting fraction.

Given information:
- Toby's first song takes 12/8 hours to play.
- Toby's second song takes 12/3 hours to play.
- Toby's third song takes 19/14 hours to play.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of 8, 3, and 14.
The LCD of 8, 3, and 14 is 168.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
12/8 hours = (12/8) Ã— (21/21) = 252/168 hours
12/3 hours = (12/3) Ã— (56/56) = 672/168 hours
19/14 hours = (19/14) Ã— (12/12) = 228/168 hours

Step 3: Add the fractions.
(252/168) + (672/168) + (228/168) = 1152/168 hours

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 1152 and 168 is 24.
1152/168 = (1152/24) / (168/24) = 48/7 hours

Therefore, it takes Toby 48/7 hours to play all three songs.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate the total time it takes Toby to play both songs with the corrected time for the first song.

Given information:
- Toby's first song takes 12/15 hours to play.
- Toby's second song takes 12/3 hours to play.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of 15 and 3.
The LCD of 15 and 3 is 15.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
12/15 hours (no need to convert, as the denominator is already 15)
12/3 hours = (12/3) Ã— (5/5) = 60/15 hours

Step 3: Add the fractions.
(12/15) + (60/15) = 72/15 hours

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 72 and 15 is 3.
72/15 = (72/3) / (15/3) = 24/5 hours

Therefore, it takes Toby 24/5 hours to play both of his songs.

Given information:
- Initially, you have 28 out of 29 chocolate bars.
- You found 8 out of 22 more chocolate bars.

Step 1: Find the total number of chocolate bars you have now.
Number of chocolate bars initially = 28
Number of chocolate bars found = 8
Total number of chocolate bars = 28 + 8 = 36

Step 2: Find the total number of chocolate bars available.
Total number of chocolate bars available = 29 + 22 = 51

Step 3: Express the total chocolate bars you have now as a fraction.
Fraction of chocolate bars you have now = Total number of chocolate bars you have / Total number of chocolate bars available
Fraction of chocolate bars you have now = 36 / 51

Therefore, the fraction that represents the total chocolate bars you have now is 36/51.

Given information:
- It takes 27/26 pounds of material to create one needle.
- The maker needs to produce two identical needles.
- The additional piece requires 27/6 pounds of material.

Step 1: Find the amount of material required for two needles.
Amount of material for one needle = 27/26 pounds
Amount of material for two needles = 2 Ã— (27/26) pounds
Amount of material for two needles = 54/26 pounds

Step 2: Find the total amount of material required for two needles and the additional piece.
Total amount of material = Amount of material for two needles + Amount of material for the additional piece
Total amount of material = (54/26) pounds + (27/6) pounds
Total amount of material = (54/26 + 135/26) pounds
Total amount of material = 189/26 pounds

Therefore, the compass maker will need a total of 189/26 pounds of material to produce the two needles and the additional piece.

Given information:
- The first candle burns at a rate of 6/4 inches per hour.
- The second candle burns at a rate of 14/16 inches per hour.

Step 1: Convert the rates to a common denominator.
Rate of the first candle = (6/4) Ã— (4/4) = 6/4 inches per hour
Rate of the second candle = (14/16) Ã— (4/4) = 7/8 inches per hour

Step 2: Add the rates together.
Total rate = Rate of the first candle + Rate of the second candle
Total rate = 6/4 + 7/8 inches per hour
Total rate = (6/4 Ã— 8/8) + (7/8 Ã— 4/4) inches per hour
Total rate = 48/32 + 28/32 inches per hour
Total rate = 76/32 inches per hour

Step 3: Simplify the fraction if possible.
76/32 = 19/8 inches per hour

Given information:

- Total time including mixing and mastering (b) = Initial time investment (p) + 28/13 hours.
- The drummer used 18/4 hours less than expected.

Step 1: Find the value of p (initial time investment).
p = 16/4 + 16/29
p = 4 + 0.5517... (approximately)
p â‰ˆ 4.552 hours

Step 2: Find the value of b (total time including mixing and mastering).
b = p + 28/13
b = 4.552 + 2.1538...

Given information:
- Monica initially has 21/15 dozens of cookies.
- She bakes an additional 29/17 dozens of cookies.
- She wants to increase her total stock of cookies by a ratio of 7/5 for the cookie festival.

Step 1: Convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions.
21/15 dozens = (21 Ã— 1 + 0)/15 = 21/15 dozens
29/17 dozens = (29 Ã— 1 + 0)/17 = 29/17 dozens

Step 2: Find the total number of dozens of cookies after baking the additional cookies.
Total dozens of cookies = Initial dozens of cookies + Additional dozens of cookies
Total dozens of cookies = 21/15 + 29/17
Total dozens of cookies = (21 Ã— 17 + 29 Ã— 15) / (15 Ã— 17)
Total dozens of cookies = 357 / 255 + 435 / 255
Total dozens of cookies = 792 / 255

Step 3: Increase the total stock of cookies by the ratio of 7/5.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of sugar used for one cake and then subtract it from the initial amount of sugar. After that, we need to add the additional sugar to the remaining amount.

Given information:
- The cake recipe requires 26/24 kg of sugar per cake.
- The chef starts with 28 kg of sugar.
- After making one cake, the chef adds 10/6 kg of sugar to their supply.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimals.
26/24 kg = 1.083 kg of sugar per cake
10/6 kg = 1.667 kg of additional sugar

Step 2: Find the amount of sugar used for one cake.
Amount of sugar used for one cake = 1.083 kg

Step 3: Find the remaining amount of sugar after making one cake.
Remaining sugar = Initial sugar - Sugar used for one cake
Remaining sugar = 28 kg - 1.083 kg = 26.917 kg

Step 4: Find the total amount of sugar after adding the additional sugar.
Total sugar = Remaining sugar + Additional sugar
Total sugar = 26.917 kg + 1.667 kg = 28.584 kg

Therefore, after making one cake and adding 10/6 kg of sugar to their supply, the chef will have 28.584 kg of sugar left.

Given information:
- Marta uses 20 colored pencils every 11 days.
- Marta uses about 23 out of every 26 colored pencils for shading techniques.

Step 1: Find the fraction of colored pencils Marta uses for shading in an 11-day period.
Fraction of colored pencils used for shading = (20 / 11) Ã— (23 / 26)

Step 2: Perform the multiplication of fractions.
(20 / 11) Ã— (23 / 26) = (20 Ã— 23) / (11 Ã— 26)
= 460 / 286

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
GCF of 460 and 286 = 2

Step 4: Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCF.
460 / 2 = 230
286 / 2 = 143

Therefore, the simplified fraction representing the number of colored pencils Marta uses for shading in her art projects over an 11-day period is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of colored pencils (regular and metallic) Marta uses over an 11-day period.

Given information:
- Marta uses 20 regular colored pencils every 11 days.
- Marta uses about 23 out of every 26 regular colored pencils for shading techniques.
- Marta uses 8 metallic colored pencils every 6 days.

Step 1: Find the fraction of regular colored pencils Marta uses for shading in an 11-day period.
Fraction of regular colored pencils used for shading = (20 / 11) Ã— (23 / 26)
= 230 / 143 (from the previous problem)

Step 2: Find the fraction of metallic colored pencils Marta uses in an 11-day period.
Fraction of metallic colored pencils used in 11 days = (8 / 6) Ã— (11 / 11)
= (8 Ã— 11) / (6 Ã— 11)
= 88 / 66

Step 3: Add the fractions of regular and metallic colored pencils used in an 11-day period.
Total fraction of colored pencils used = (230 / 143) + (88 / 66)
= (230 Ã— 66 + 88 Ã— 143) / (143 Ã— 66)
= 15180 + 12544 / 9478
= 27724 / 9478

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
GCF of 27724 and 9478 = 2

Step 5: Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCF.
27724 / 2 = 13862
9478 / 2 = 4739

Therefore, the total number of colored pencils (regular and metallic) Marta uses over an 11-day period, expressed as a simplified fraction, is:

Given information:
- Marta uses 20 colored pencils every 11 days.
- Marta uses 23 out of every 24 colored pencils for shading techniques.

Step 1: Find the fraction of colored pencils Marta uses for shading in an 11-day period.
Fraction of colored pencils used for shading = (20 / 11) Ã— (23 / 24)

Step 2: Perform the multiplication of fractions.
(20 / 11) Ã— (23 / 24) = (20 Ã— 23) / (11 Ã— 24)
= 460 / 264

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
GCF of 460 and 264 = 4

Step 4: Divide the numerator and denominator by the GCF.
460 / 4 = 115
264 / 4 = 66

Therefore, the simplified fraction representing the number of colored pencils Marta uses for shading in her art projects over an 11-day period is:

            A police investigator is analyzing two evidence specimens. The first specimen has a unique property that decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units. The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units. The investigator needs to find the ratio of these changes, referred to as indicator i.

Additionally, he needs to figure out a set of changes in another pair of evidence specimens. The first one of this pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units and the second one increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units. The investigator has to find the difference between these two rates and refer to it as indicator h.

He then combines these two indicators (h and i) by multiplying them to get a final evidence factor, referred to as indicator f. This will help determine the likelihood of a particular suspectâ€™s involvement. Calculate the value of f.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the values of indicators i and h, and then calculate their product to get indicator f.

Given information:
- The first specimen decreases its value by 26 out of every 6 units.
- The second specimen decreases its value by 25 out of every 17 units.
- The first specimen of the second pair increases its value by 18 out of every 8 units.
- The second specimen of the second pair increases its value by 17 out of every 23 units.

Step 1: Find the ratio of the changes in the first pair of specimens (indicator i).
Ratio of change for the first specimen = 26/6 = 4.33
Ratio of change for the second specimen = 25/17 â‰ˆ 1.47
Indicator i = Ratio of change for the first specimen / Ratio of change for the second specimen
Indicator i = 4.33 / 1.47 â‰ˆ 2.94

Step 2: Find the difference between the rates of change in the second pair of specimens (indicator h).
Rate of change for the first specimen = 18/8 = 2.25
Rate of change for the second specimen = 17/23 â‰ˆ 0.74
Indicator h = Rate of change for the first specimen - Rate of change for the second specimen
Indicator h = 2.25 - 0.74 = 1.51

Step 3: Calculate the final evidence factor (indicator f) by multiplying indicators i and h.
Indicator f = Indicator i Ã— Indicator h
Indicator f = 2.94 Ã— 1.51 â‰ˆ 4.44

Therefore, the final evidence factor (indicator f) is approximately 4.44.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total gestation period of both animals together and then calculate the reduced gestation period for the lioness in the second pregnancy.

Given information:
- The gestation period of a lioness is 20/22 of a year.
- The gestation period of a giraffe is 15 years.
- In the second pregnancy, the lioness's gestation period reduces by 15/20 of the earlier total gestation period of both animals.

Step 1: Find the total gestation period of both animals together.
Gestation period of a lioness = 20/22 years
Gestation period of a giraffe = 15 years
Total gestation period = Gestation period of a lioness + Gestation period of a giraffe
Total gestation period = 20/22 + 15 years
Total gestation period = (20/22 + 330/22) years (converting 15 years to 330/22 years)
Total gestation period = 350/22 years

Step 2: Calculate the reduced gestation period for the lioness in the second pregnancy.
Reduction in gestation period = 15/20 of the earlier total gestation period
Reduction in gestation period = (15/20) Ã— (350/22) years
Reduction in gestation period = 105/44 years

New gestation period for the lioness = Earlier gestation period - Reduction in gestation period
New gestation period for the lioness = 20/22 years - 105/44 years
New gestation period for the lioness = (440/484 - 105/484) years
New gestation period for the lioness = 335/484 years

Therefore, it will take 335/484 years (approximately 0.692 years or 8.3 months) for the lioness to give birth in the second pregnancy.

Area of the original rectangle = (30 Ã— 19) / (7 Ã— 6)
Area of the original rectangle = 570 / 42
Area of the original rectangle = 13.57 square meters

Step 2: Find the area of the similar rectangle.
Area of the similar rectangle = Area of the original rectangle Ã— (18/17)
Area of the similar rectangle = 13.57 Ã— (18/17)
Area of the similar rectangle = 244.26 / 17
Area of the similar rectangle = 14.37 square meters

Therefore, the area of the similar rectangle is 14.37 square meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the initial production, then add the increase and subtract the reduction.

Given information:
- The factory produces 23/8 tonnes of soap each day.
- They increased production by an extra 4/20 of a tonne.
- They reduced production by 19/24 of a tonne due to a power cut.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to a common denominator.
Initial production = 23/8 tonnes = (23 Ã— 3)/24 = 69/24 tonnes
Increase in production = 4/20 tonnes = (4 Ã— 6)/120 = 24/120 tonnes
Reduction in production = 19/24 tonnes

Step 2: Add the increase to the initial production.
Production after increase = 69/24 + 24/120 = (69 Ã— 5 + 24)/120 = 369/120 tonnes

Step 3: Subtract the reduction from the production after increase.
Final production = 369/120 - 19/24 = (369/120 - 19/30) = (369 - 57)/120 = 312/120 tonnes

Step 4: Convert the final production to a mixed number.
312/120 = 2 60/120 = 2 1/2 tonnes

The machine starts by mixing 24/8 gallons of red paint. It then pours away 12/8 gallons of the mix. Let 'd' represent the amount of red paint left in the machine.

Finally, the machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color, subtract that from 'd' to find 'x' in gallons, which is the total amount of paint. Find the value of 'x'.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow the given steps and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- The machine starts by mixing 24/8 = 3 gallons of red paint.
- It then pours away 12/8 = 1.5 gallons of the mix.
- Let 'd' represent the amount of red paint left in the machine.
- The machine adds another 1/28 gallon of blue pigment to lighten the color.
- 'x' is the total amount of paint after adding the blue pigment.

Step 1: Find the amount of red paint left in the machine after pouring away 1.5 gallons.
Amount of red paint left = Initial amount of red paint - Amount poured away
d = 3 gallons - 1.5 gallons
d = 1.5 gallons

Step 2: Find the total amount of paint 'x' after adding the blue pigment.
x = Amount of red paint left + Amount of blue pigment added
x = 1.5 gallons + 1/28 gallon
x = 1.5 gallons + (1/28) Ã— (1/4) gallon (Converting 1/28 to a fraction of a gallon)
x = 1.5 gallons + 0.0089 gallon
x = 1.5089 gallons

Therefore, the total amount of paint 'x' after adding the blue pigment is 1.5089 gallons.

To simplify the fraction 459/182, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 459 and 182, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 459 and 182 is 7.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find a common denominator for all the fractions involved, and then add the numerators.

Given information:
- Sonia uses 21/12 oz of toothpaste daily.
- Anthony uses 6/27 oz of toothpaste daily.
- Their mom uses 3/18 oz of toothpaste daily.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 12, 27, and 18.
LCM of 12, 27, and 18 = 108

Step 2: Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 108.
Sonia's toothpaste usage = (21/12) Ã— (9/9) = 189/108 oz
Anthony's toothpaste usage = (6/27) Ã— (4/4) = 24/108 oz
Mom's toothpaste usage = (3/18) Ã— (6/6) = 18/108 oz

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
Total toothpaste usage = 189/108 + 24/108 + 18/108
Total toothpaste usage = (189 + 24 + 18)/108
Total toothpaste usage = 231/108 oz

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
GCF of 231 and 108 = 3
231/108 = (231/3) / (108/3)
231/108 = 77/36 oz

Therefore, the total daily toothpaste usage for the whole family is 77/36 oz.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 12, 27, 18, and 28.
LCM of 12, 27, 18, and 28 = 1512

Step 2: Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 1512.
Sonia's toothpaste usage = (21/12) Ã— (126/126) = 2646/1512 oz
Anthony's toothpaste usage = (6/27) Ã— (56/56) = 336/1512 oz
Mom's toothpaste usage = (3/18) Ã— (84/84) = 252/1512 oz
Grandma's toothpaste usage = (24/28) Ã— (54/54) = 1296/1512 oz

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
Total toothpaste usage = 2646/1512 + 336/1512 + 252/1512 + 1296/1512
Total toothpaste usage = (2646 + 336 + 252 + 1296)/1512
Total toothpaste usage = 4530/1512 oz

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
GCF of 4530 and 1512 = 6
4530/1512 = (4530/6) / (1512/6)
4530/1512 = 755/252 oz

Therefore, the total daily toothpaste usage for the whole family, including grandma, is 755/252 oz.

Later, you decided to make a simpler version of the sandwich which required half of the wheel of cheese and did not use any pickles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the fraction of the original ingredients left after making the special sandwiches, and then subtract the fraction used for the simpler sandwich.

Given information:
- After making the special sandwiches, you have ((7 / 18) + (21 / 14)) of the original ingredients left.
- For the simpler sandwich, you need half of the wheel of cheese, which is (1 / 2) of the remaining cheese.

Step 1: Find the fraction of the original ingredients left after making the special sandwiches.
(7 / 18) + (21 / 14) = (42 / 126) + (147 / 126) = 189 / 126

Step 2: Find the fraction of the remaining cheese used for the simpler sandwich.
Fraction of remaining cheese used = 1 / 2

Step 3: Convert the fractions to a common denominator.
189 / 126 = (189 Ã— 2) / 252
1 / 2 = 126 / 252

Step 4: Subtract the fraction used for the simpler sandwich from the fraction left after making the special sandwiches.
(189 Ã— 2) / 252 - 126 / 252 = 252 / 252

Therefore, after making the simpler sandwich, you have 252 / 252 = 1 (or the whole) of the original ingredients left.

16/6 = (16 Ã· 6) + (16 % 6)/6 = 2 + 4/6 = 2 + 2/3 = 14/3 liters of apple juice
20/12 = (20 Ã· 12) + (20 % 12)/12 = 1 + 8/12 = 1 + 2/3 = 5/3 liters of orange juice

Step 2: Convert all quantities to the same unit (thirds).
Apple juice = 14/3 liters
Orange juice = 5/3 liters
Cranberry juice = 2/3 liters

Step 3: Add the quantities together.
Total juice = Apple juice + Orange juice + Cranberry juice
Total juice = 14/3 + 5/3 + 2/3
Total juice = 21/3 liters

Therefore, Jan has a total of 21/3 liters of juice.

Given information:
- Each level gives 4/3 points.

Step 1: Convert the mixed fraction 13/10 to an improper fraction.
13/10 = (13 Ã— 1 + 0)/10 = 13/10

Step 2: Multiply the number of points per level (4/3) by the number of levels played (13/10).
Points earned = (4/3) Ã— (13/10)
Points earned = (4 Ã— 13) / (3 Ã— 10)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total time spent on the previous &quot;work&quot; routine and then add the time for the new activity.

Given information:
- The astronaut spends 18/8 hours a day cycling on the exercise bike.
- The astronaut spends 26/2 hours a day conducting scientific experiments.
- The astronaut adds 30/8 hours of reviewing data from the mission.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimal values.
18/8 hours = 2.25 hours (cycling on the exercise bike)
26/2 hours = 13 hours (conducting scientific experiments)
30/8 hours = 3.75 hours (reviewing data from the mission)

Step 2: Find the total time spent on the previous &quot;work&quot; routine.
Total time spent on the previous &quot;work&quot; routine = Time spent cycling + Time spent on scientific experiments
Total time spent on the previous &quot;work&quot; routine = 2.25 hours + 13 hours = 15.25 hours

Step 3: Find the total time spent on the whole daily routine by adding the time for the new activity.
Total time spent on the whole daily routine = Total time spent on the previous &quot;work&quot; routine + Time spent reviewing data
Total time spent on the whole daily routine = 15.25 hours + 3.75 hours = 19 hours

- The astronaut reduces the time spent on scientific experiments from 26/2 hours to 11/2 hours a day.
- The astronaut spends 30/8 hours a day reviewing data from the mission (unchanged).

Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimal values.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the value of 'd', which represents the amount of cheese Jeremy actually received.

Given information:
- Jeremy ordered slices of cheese that weighed 30/9 ounces in total.
- There was 17/22 ounces less cheese than he requested.
- The equation to find the amount of cheese he received is: d = n - (17/22)

Step 1: Convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions.
n = 30/9 = (30 Ã— 1 + 0) / 9 = 30/9
17/22 = (17 Ã— 1 + 0) / 22 = 17/22

Step 2: Substitute the values in the equation.
d = n - (17/22)
d = 30/9 - 17/22

Step 3: Find the least common denominator (LCD) for the fractions.
LCD = 198 (the least common multiple of 9 and 22)

Step 4: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
30/9 = (30 Ã— 22) / (9 Ã— 22) = 660/198
17/22 = (17 Ã— 9) / (22 Ã— 9) = 153/198

Step 5: Perform the subtraction.
d = 660/198 - 153/198
d = 507/198

Step 6: Convert the improper fraction to a mixed fraction (if applicable).
d = 2 + (507 - (198 Ã— 2)) / 198
d = 2 + 111/198

Therefore, Jeremy actually received 2 + 111/198 ounces of cheese.

Given information:
- Each of Jeremy's friends wants a sandwich with (30/18) ounces of cheese.
- Jeremy received 'd' ounces of cheese from the shop, where d = 2 + 111/198 (from the previous problem).
- The formula to find the total amount of cheese is: k = (30/18) * d

Step 1: Convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions.
d = 2 + 111/198 = (2 Ã— 198 + 111) / 198 = 507/198
30/18 = (30 Ã— 1 + 0) / 18 = 30/18

Step 2: Substitute the values in the formula.
k = (30/18) * d
k = (30/18) * (507/198)

Step 3: Multiply the fractions.
k = (30 Ã— 507) / (18 Ã— 198)
k = 15210 / 3564
k = 4 + 282/3564

- There was 20/22 ounces less cheese than he requested.
- The equation to find the amount of cheese he received is: d = n - (20/22)

Step 1: Convert the mixed fractions to improper fractions.
n = 30/9 = (30 Ã— 1 + 0) / 9 = 30/9
20/22 = (20 Ã— 1 + 0) / 22 = 20/22

Step 2: Substitute the values in the equation.
d = n - (20/22)
d = 30/9 - 20/22

Step 3: Find the least common denominator (LCD) for the fractions.
LCD = 198 (the least common multiple of 9 and 22)

Step 4: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

d = 480/198

Step 6: Convert the improper fraction to a mixed fraction (if applicable).
d = 2 + (480 - (198 Ã— 2)) / 198

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the fractions representing the sunglasses that blocked all UV rays, and then subtract the fraction representing the sunglasses that did not block all UV rays.

Given information:
- 13 out of every 4 sunglasses blocked all UV rays (first test)
- 20 out of every 18 sunglasses blocked all UV rays (second test)
- 21 out of every 17 sunglasses blocked all UV rays (additional batch)
- 16 out of every 30 sunglasses did not block all UV rays (mistake)

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
Common denominator = 4 Ã— 18 Ã— 17 Ã— 30 = 36720

13/4 = (13 Ã— 9180)/36720 = 117420/36720
20/18 = (20 Ã— 2040)/36720 = 40800/36720
21/17 = (21 Ã— 2160)/36720 = 45360/36720
16/30 = (16 Ã— 1224)/36720 = 19584/36720

Step 2: Add the fractions representing the sunglasses that blocked all UV rays.
Sum of fractions = (117420/36720) + (40800/36720) + (45360/36720)
Sum of fractions = 203580/36720

Step 3: Subtract the fraction representing the sunglasses that did not block all UV rays.
Final fraction = (203580/36720) - (19584/36720)
Final fraction = 183996/36720

Step 4: Simplify the fraction.
183996/36720 = 5/1 = 5

Therefore, the final corrected number of sunglasses that blocked all UV rays, according to Sophia's tests and calculations, is 5.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow the given steps and perform the necessary calculations.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of mayonnaise and sandwich spread needed for one sandwich.
Mayonnaise: 23/28 cups
Sandwich spread: 6/9 cups
Total = 23/28 + 6/9 cups

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

LCD of 28 and 9 is 252.
23/28 = (23 Ã— 9)/252 = 207/252
6/9 = (6 Ã— 28)/252 = 168/252
Total = 207/252 + 168/252 = 375/252 cups

Step 2: Add the cheese spread to the recipe.
Cheese spread: 18/12 cups
To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the LCD and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

LCD of 252 and 12 is 252.
18/12 = (18 Ã— 21)/252 = 378/252 cups
Total = 375/252 + 378/252 = 753/252 cups

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of ingredients needed if Shawn has to make an equal number of sandwiches using 4/4 cups of all the ingredients combined.
Total ingredients needed for one sandwich = 753/252 cups
Total ingredients needed for 4/4 cups = (753/252) Ã— (4/1) = 3012/252 cups

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of key sets Cassandra had initially and then subtract the fraction of a key set she lost.

Given information:
- Initially, Cassandra had a collection equivalent to 7/6 of a key set.
- She lost 1/21 of a key set.

Step 1: Convert the initial fraction to a mixed number.
7/6 = 1 + 1/6 key sets

Step 2: Subtract the fraction of a key set she lost from the initial number of key sets.
Initial number of key sets - Fraction of a key set lost = Final number of key sets
1 + 1/6 - 1/21 = 1 + (1/6 - 1/21)
             = 1 + (3/42 - 2/42)
             = 1 + 1/42
             = 43/42 key sets

Therefore, after losing 1/21 of a key set, Cassandra has 43/42 key sets.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the ratios of the two sections and the ratio of a rest, and then calculate the difference between them.

Given information:
- In the first section, the ratio of notes to measures is 29/23.
- In the second section, the ratio of notes to measures is 19/17.
- The ratio of a rest, which is equivalent to one whole measure, is 26/26.

Step 1: Find the sum of the ratios of the two sections.
Sum of ratios = (29/23) + (19/17)
Sum of ratios = 1.26086956521739 + 1.11764705882353
Sum of ratios = 2.37851662404092

Step 2: Find the ratio of a rest (one whole measure).
Ratio of a rest = 26/26 = 1

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the sum of the ratios and the ratio of a rest.
Difference = Sum of ratios - Ratio of a rest
Difference = 2.37851662404092 - 1
Difference = 1.37851662404092

Therefore, the difference between the sum of the ratios of the two sections and the ratio of a rest (one whole measure) used in the third section of the composition is 1.37851662404092.

Given:
- The result from multiplying 22/25 and 22/8 is 121/50
- The number etched on the key is 23/13

To add two fractions, we need to find a common denominator.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 50 and 13 to get the common denominator.
The LCM of 50 and 13 is 650.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 650.
121/50 = (121 Ã— 13)/650 = 1573/650
23/13 = (23 Ã— 50)/650 = 1150/650

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the common denominator.
(1573 + 1150)/650 = 2723/650

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 2723 and 650 is 1.
Therefore, the simplified fraction is 2723/650.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total length of the pillow, including the additional length due to fluffing, and then multiply it by a factor to account for overlap and corners.

Given information:
- The pillow is 23/9 feet long.
- An additional 22/25 feet of length is added due to fluffing.
- The total length is multiplied by 16/13 to account for overlap and corners.

Step 1: Find the total length of the pillow, including the additional length due to fluffing.
Total length = Length of the pillow + Additional length due to fluffing
Total length = 23/9 feet + 22/25 feet
Total length = (23 Ã— 25 + 22 Ã— 9) / (9 Ã— 25) feet
Total length = 575/225 + 198/225 feet
Total length = 773/225 feet

Step 2: Multiply the total length by 16/13 to account for overlap and corners.
Length of border material needed = Total length Ã— 16/13
Length of border material needed = (773/225) Ã— (16/13) feet
Length of border material needed = (773 Ã— 16) / (225 Ã— 13) feet
Length of border material needed = 12368 / 2925 feet

- The car was needed to travel an extra 16/13 miles.
- Due to a detour, the car only traveled an additional 1/21 miles.

Step 1: Find the additional distance the car was supposed to travel.
Additional distance needed = 16/13 miles - 1/21 miles
Additional distance needed = (16 Ã— 21 - 1) / (13 Ã— 21) miles

            The jeweler decided to use a more expensive gold making process for his rings, which requires a slightly larger amount of gold, specifically 21/28 of a kilogram instead of the original 14/28. Taking this into account, now how much total weight of gold and silver is he using to craft his rings?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this updated problem.

Given information:
- The jeweler now uses 21/28 of a kilogram of gold.
- The jeweler still uses 13/26 of a kilogram of silver.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimals.
21/28 = 0.75 kilograms of gold
13/26 = 0.5 kilograms of silver

Step 2: Add the amounts of gold and silver.
Amount of gold + Amount of silver = Total amount used
0.75 kilograms + 0.5 kilograms = 1.25 kilograms

Therefore, with the updated amount of gold (21/28 of a kilogram), the total weight of gold and silver used by the jeweler to craft his rings is 1.25 kilograms.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In a beehive, there are sections for honey storage and bee rearing. Each section is classified into many sub-sections. One day, the beekeeper discovered that each honey storage sub-section had (25 / 9) gallons of honey. He also found the same amount of honey in each bee rearing sub-section. 

If he combined the honey from both a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the beekeeper would have a total quantity represented by 'p'. 

However, one honey storage sub-section had an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey. So, if the beekeeper was calculating the total amount from this sub-section plus a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be defined as 's'. 

What quantity of honey ('s') would the beekeeper have in total from this scenario?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the values of 'p' and 's'.

Given information:
- Each honey storage sub-section had (25 / 9) gallons of honey.
- Each bee rearing sub-section had the same amount of honey as a honey storage sub-section.
- If the beekeeper combined the honey from a honey storage sub-section and a bee rearing sub-section, the total quantity would be 'p'.
- One honey storage sub-section had an additional (2 / 26) gallons of honey.
- If the beekeeper calculated the total amount from this sub-section plus a bee rearing sub-section, the total amount of honey would be defined as 's'.

Step 1: Find the amount of honey in each honey storage sub-section and each bee rearing sub-section.
Amount of honey in each sub-section = 25 / 9 = 2.777... gallons (approximately)

Step 2: Find the value of 'p'.
'p' = Amount of honey in a honey storage sub-section + Amount of honey in a bee rearing sub-section
'p' = 2.777... + 2.777...
'p' = 5.555... gallons (approximately)

Step 3: Find the value of 's'.
's' = Amount of honey in the honey storage sub-section with additional honey + Amount of honey in a bee rearing sub-section
's' = (2.777... + 2 / 26) + 2.777...
's' = (2.777... + 0.076...) + 2.777...
's' = 5.631... gallons (approximately)

Therefore, the quantity of honey ('s') that the beekeeper would have in total from this scenario is approximately 5.631 gallons.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the fractions representing the amount of fish eaten by the bear on each day, and then simplify the resulting fraction.

Given information:
- Day 1: The bear ate 28/6 pounds of fish.
- Day 2: The bear ate 21/18 pounds of fish.
- Day 3: The bear ate 24/22 pounds of fish.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) for the fractions.
LCD = 6 Ã— 18 Ã— 22 = 2,376

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
Day 1: 28/6 = (28 Ã— 396)/2,376 = 1,108/2,376
Day 2: 21/18 = (21 Ã— 132)/2,376 = 2,772/2,376
Day 3: 24/22 = (24 Ã— 108)/2,376 = 2,592/2,376

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
Total numerator = 1,108 + 2,772 + 2,592 = 6,472

Step 4: Express the total as a fraction with the LCD as the denominator.
Total pounds of fish eaten = 6,472/2,376

Step 5: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.
GCF of 6,472 and 2,376 = 8
6,472/8 = 809
2,376/8 = 297

Therefore, the total pounds of fish eaten by the bear in three days, written as a simplified fraction, is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of sugar required for the bread and custard, and then multiply it by the factor of 29/21.

Given information:
- For the bread recipe, Heather needed 11/17 cups of sugar.
- For the custard dessert, Heather needed 6/2 = 3 cups of sugar.
- Heather decided to increase the total quantity of sugar by a factor of 29/21.

Step 1: Find the total amount of sugar required for the bread and custard before increasing.
Total sugar required = Sugar for bread + Sugar for custard
Total sugar required = 11/17 + 3 cups
Total sugar required = (11/17 + 51/17) cups
Total sugar required = 62/17 cups

Step 2: Increase the total quantity of sugar by a factor of 29/21.
Increased total sugar = Total sugar required Ã— (29/21)
Increased total sugar = (62/17) Ã— (29/21)
Increased total sugar = (62 Ã— 29) / (17 Ã— 21)
Increased total sugar = 1798 / 357
Increased total sugar = 5.0392 cups (approximately)

Therefore, Heather used approximately 5.0392 cups of sugar in total for the three-course dinner.

- The royal baker needs 26/20 gallons of milk for each of the cakes he's baking.

Step 1: Find the guests' consumption of water and wine.
Guests' consumption of water = 15/7 gallons
Guests' consumption of wine = 15/24 gallons

Step 2: Find the baker's requirement for milk.
Baker's requirement for milk = 26/20 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of liquid (v) that will be consumed if the baker's requirement is multiplied by the guests' consumption (i).
v = Baker's requirement for milk Ã— (Guests' consumption of water + Guests' consumption of wine)
v = (26/20) Ã— ((15/7) + (15/24))
v = (26/20) Ã— ((105/168) + (15/24))

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow the given operations step by step.

Given information:
- Teddy's favorite number is 30/17.
- Teddy adds 18/15 to his favorite number.
- Teddy then multiplies the result by 24/13.

Step 1: Add 30/17 and 18/15.
To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

LCD of 17 and 15 = 17 Ã— 15 = 255

30/17 = (30 Ã— 15)/255 = 450/255
18/15 = (18 Ã— 17)/255 = 306/255

450/255 + 306/255 = 756/255

Step 2: Multiply 756/255 by 24/13.
756/255 Ã— 24/13 = (756 Ã— 24) / (255 Ã— 13)
                = 18144 / 3315

            Johnny is building a scooter from scratch. He needs to drill holes into the scooter deck to attach the wheels. The size of each hole should be approximately (20/6) cm in diameter. Unfortunately, his drill bit only has a diameter of (11/21) cm. If he uses his current drill bit, he needs to drill a hole, move it over and drill again to achieve the diameter he needs. If he drills each hole exactly once with his drill bit, calculate what fraction of the desired diameter would each hole have? Don't simplify the fraction, keep as (20/6) * (11 / 21).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the diameter of the drill bit to the desired diameter of the hole.

Given information:
- The desired diameter of the hole is (20/6) cm.
- The diameter of the drill bit is (11/21) cm.

Step 1: Find the fraction of the desired diameter that the drill bit diameter represents.
Fraction of desired diameter = Diameter of drill bit / Desired diameter
Fraction of desired diameter = (11/21) / (20/6)
Fraction of desired diameter = (11/21) Ã— (6/20)
Fraction of desired diameter = (66/420)

Therefore, if Johnny drills each hole exactly once with his drill bit, each hole will have (66/420) of the desired diameter.

Given information:
- The first model takes 17/10 hours to assemble.
- The second model takes 12/23 hours to assemble.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimals for easier comparison.
17/10 = 1.7 hours
12/23 â‰ˆ 0.5217 hours

Step 2: Subtract the time it takes to assemble the second model from the time it takes to assemble the first model.
Time difference = Time for the first model - Time for the second model
Time difference = 1.7 hours - 0.5217 hours
Time difference = 1.1783 hours

Step 3: Convert the decimal back to a simplified fraction.
1.1783 = 59/50 hours

Therefore, the second model will take 59/50 hours less time to assemble than the first model.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of wood required for the usual chair and then calculate the additional amount of wood required for the special chair.

Given information:
- Carlos usually uses 20/15 units of wood for a regular chair.
- For the special chair, he needs (24/5) times (7/6) units more wood than usual.

Step 1: Find the amount of wood required for the usual chair.
Amount of wood for a usual chair = 20/15 units

Step 2: Calculate the additional amount of wood required for the special chair.
Additional amount of wood = (24/5) Ã— (7/6) units
Additional amount of wood = (24 Ã— 7) / (5 Ã— 6) units
Additional amount of wood = 168/30 units
Additional amount of wood = 28/5 units

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of wood required for the special chair.
Total amount of wood = Amount of wood for a usual chair + Additional amount of wood
Total amount of wood = 20/15 + 28/5 units
Total amount of wood = (20 Ã— 5 + 28 Ã— 3) / (15 Ã— 3) units
Total amount of wood = (100 + 84) / 45 units
Total amount of wood = 184/45 units

To express the answer in simplest form, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 184 and 45, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

GCD of 184 and 45 is 1.

Therefore, the simplest form of 184/45 is 184/45.

Given information:
- Initial speed = 13/4 miles per minute
- Speed reduction = 14/15 miles per minute
- Speed increase = 30/15 miles per minute

Step 1: Convert the initial speed to miles per hour.
Initial speed in miles per hour = (13/4) Ã— 60 = 195 miles per hour

Step 2: Convert the speed reduction to miles per hour.
Speed reduction in miles per hour = (14/15) Ã— 60 = 56 miles per hour

Step 3: Calculate the speed after the reduction.
Speed after reduction = Initial speed - Speed reduction
Speed after reduction = 195 miles per hour - 56 miles per hour = 139 miles per hour

Step 4: Convert the speed increase to miles per hour.
Speed increase in miles per hour = (30/15) Ã— 60 = 120 miles per hour

Step 5: Calculate the final speed after the increase.
Final speed = Speed after reduction + Speed increase
Final speed = 139 miles per hour + 120 miles per hour = 259 miles per hour

Step 6: Convert the final speed to miles per minute.

Given information:
- The vineyard usually produces 19/2 baskets of grapes every season.
- Due to weather conditions, only 19/29 of the usual amount were produced this season.
- Jake gets to keep 7/11 of the total amount of grapes.
- Jake uses 9/10 of his grapes to make grape juice.

Step 1: Find the usual amount of baskets of grapes produced by the vineyard.
Usual amount of baskets = 19/2 = 9.5 baskets

Step 2: Find the amount of baskets of grapes produced this season.
Amount produced this season = (19/29) Ã— 9.5 = 6.1724 baskets (approximately)

Step 3: Find the amount of baskets of grapes Jake gets to keep.
Jake's share = (7/11) Ã— 6.1724 = 3.9091 baskets (approximately)

Step 4: Find the amount of baskets of grapes Jake uses for making grape juice.
Amount used for grape juice = (9/10) Ã— 3.9091 = 3.5182 baskets (approximately)

Given information:
- Joel picked 9/2 bushels of red grapes.
- Joel picked 10/22 bushels of green grapes.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
Common denominator = 22
9/2 bushels of red grapes = (9/2) Ã— (11/11) = 99/22 bushels of red grapes
10/22 bushels of green grapes = 10/22 bushels of green grapes

Step 2: Add the number of bushels of red grapes and green grapes.
Total number of bushels of grapes = Number of bushels of red grapes + Number of bushels of green grapes
Total number of bushels of grapes = 99/22 + 10/22
Total number of bushels of grapes = 109/22

Step 3: Convert the fraction to a mixed number or decimal form (if needed).
109/22 = 4 99/22 (mixed number form)

Step 1: Find the radius of the larger snowball.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to a common denominator.
Least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 16 = 112
24/7 = (24 Ã— 16)/112 = 384/112
2/16 = (2 Ã— 7)/112 = 14/112

Step 2: Subtract the amount of sand taken away from the initial amount.
Initial amount of sand = 384/112
Amount of sand taken away = 14/112
Remaining amount of sand = 384/112 - 14/112 = 370/112

Step 3: Simplify the fraction if possible.
370/112 = (370 Ã· 2) / (112 Ã· 2) = 185/56

Given information:
- The lion ate 28/26 of a zebra in one day.
- The lion ate 23/9 of a wildebeest the next day.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
28/26 = (28/26) Ã— (9/9) = 252/234
23/9 = (23/9) Ã— (26/26) = 598/234

Step 2: Subtract the fraction of the zebra from the fraction of the wildebeest.
598/234 - 252/234 = 346/234

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 346 and 234 is 28.
346/234 = (346/28) / (234/28) = 12.357/8.357

Next, let's calculate 21/11:
21/11 = 1.909...

Now, we can multiply these two values:
(14/4) * (21/11) = 3.5 * 1.909... = 6.68...

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the expected number of bananas produced by each species per day, and then add them together.

Given information:
- Species 1 produces 12 bananas every 29 days.
- Species 2 produces 30 bananas every 10 days.

Step 1: Find the expected number of bananas produced by Species 1 per day.
Expected number of bananas produced by Species 1 per day = 12 bananas / 29 days
Expected number of bananas produced by Species 1 per day = 12/29

Step 2: Find the expected number of bananas produced by Species 2 per day.
Expected number of bananas produced by Species 2 per day = 30 bananas / 10 days
Expected number of bananas produced by Species 2 per day = 30/10 = 3

Step 3: Find the expected number of bananas produced by both species together per day.
Expected number of bananas produced by both species per day = (12/29) + (30/10)
Expected number of bananas produced by both species per day = (12/29) + 3
Expected number of bananas produced by both species per day = 0.4137... + 3
Expected number of bananas produced by both species per day = 3.4137...

Given information:
- The giraffe needs to eat 11/11 ton of acacia leaves per day.
- The giraffe needs to eat 26/14 ton of grasses per day.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to a common denominator.
Common denominator = 11 Ã— 14 = 154

11/11 ton of acacia leaves = (11/11) Ã— (14/14) = 14/154 ton
26/14 ton of grasses = (26/14) Ã— (11/11) = 26/154 ton

Step 2: Add the fractions together.
Total ton of food per day = 14/154 + 26/154
                          = 40/154 ton

Step 3: Convert the fraction to a mixed number.
40/154 = 0.259... ton

- The bear's activity is tracked for 27 days.
- Each month has 13 weeks.

Step 1: Find the fraction of time the bear spends sleeping each day.
Fraction of time sleeping each day = 18 hours / 24 hours = 18/24 = 3/4

Step 2: Find the fraction of time the bear spends sleeping over the 27 days.
Fraction of time sleeping over 27 days = (Fraction of time sleeping each day) Ã— (Number of days) / (Number of weeks in a month)
Fraction of time sleeping over 27 days = (3/4) Ã— (27/13)
Fraction of time sleeping over 27 days = (3 Ã— 27) / (4 Ã— 13)

            After calculating the amount of time the bear spends sleeping over the 27 days, consider that for a ratio of 23 hours every 20 days, the bear is disturbed by hikers and awoken from its slumber, interrupting the sleeping schedule. How much of the time would be spent awake due to this disturbance over the course of the 27 days tracked of the month? To solve this, you will need to first calculate the fraction of time the bear is awake based on the ratio, and then multiply this by the previous answer.

- The fraction of time the bear spends sleeping over the 27 days is 1.5576923076923076 (from the previous answer).

Step 1: Find the fraction of time the bear is awake due to the disturbance caused by hikers.
Fraction of time awake due to disturbance = Ratio of disturbance hours to days
Fraction of time awake due to disturbance = 23 hours / 20 days
Fraction of time awake due to disturbance = 23/20 = 1.15

Step 2: Calculate the fraction of time the bear is awake due to the disturbance over the 27 days.
Fraction of time awake due to disturbance over 27 days = (Fraction of time awake due to disturbance) Ã— (Fraction of time sleeping over 27 days)
Fraction of time awake due to disturbance over 27 days = (1.15) Ã— (1.5576923076923076)

Given information:

- The observation period is 27 days.
- Each month has 13 weeks.

Step 1: Find the fraction of time the bear spends hibernating each day.
Fraction of time hibernating each day = 29 hours / 24 hours = 29/24 = 1.2083333333333333

Step 2: Find the proportion of time the bear spends hibernating over the 27 days.
Proportion of time hibernating over 27 days = (Fraction of time hibernating each day) Ã— (Number of days) / (Number of weeks in a month)
Proportion of time hibernating over 27 days = (1.2083333333333333) Ã— (27/13)
Proportion of time hibernating over 27 days = (1.2083333333333333 Ã— 27) / 13
Proportion of time hibernating over 27 days = 32.625 / 13
Proportion of time hibernating over 27 days = 2.5096153846153847 (in decimal form)

Given information:
- 9 out of every 14 trees are pine trees.
- 19 out of every 2 trees are birch trees.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to a common denominator.
For pine trees, 9/14 = 63/98 (multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 7)
For birch trees, 19/2 = 855/98 (multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 49)

Step 2: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(63/98) + (855/98) = 918/98

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 918 and 98 is 2.
918/98 = (918/2) / (98/2) = 459/49

Step 1: Calculate the initial energy level.
(14 / 2) / (23 / 17) = 7 / (23 / 17)

Given information:
- Teddy hides 18/11 of his friends in the forest.
- Teddy hides 8/21 of his friends at the beach.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimals.
18/11 = 1.636363636...
8/21 = 0.380952381...

Step 2: Assume Teddy has 100 friends (to make the calculations easier).
Number of friends hidden in the forest = 1.636363636... Ã— 100 = 163.64 (approximately)
Number of friends hidden at the beach = 0.380952381... Ã— 100 = 38.10 (approximately)

Step 3: Find the difference between the number of friends hidden in the forest and at the beach.
Difference = Number of friends hidden in the forest - Number of friends hidden at the beach
Difference = 163.64 - 38.10 = 125.54

Let's call this difference 'f'.
f = 125.54

Step 4: Square 'f' to find 'n', the total number of hiding spots Teddy needs.
n = f^2
n = (125.54)^2
n = 15,752.9116

Since the number of hiding spots should be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Given information:
- The robot starts with 25/10 units of energy.
- The robot uses 27/23 units of energy for complex computations.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
25/10 = 25/10 Ã— 23/23 = 575/230
27/23 = 27/23 Ã— 10/10 = 270/230

Step 2: Subtract the energy used from the initial energy.
Initial energy - Energy used = Energy left
575/230 - 270/230 = 305/230

Step 3: Simplify the fraction if possible.
305/230 = 1 25/230 (The greatest common divisor of 305 and 230 is 5)

Therefore, the robot has 1 25/230 units of energy left after completing the complex computations.

            During rainy weather, a small snail moves at a snail-pace covering 17/21 of a meter in an hour. Another slightly faster snail covers 20/24 of a meter in the same time during such weather. 

One rainy day, the first snail started an hour earlier than the second. At the time when the second snail began, a third snail that covers 18/17 of a meter per hour also started moving. 

What is their total distance in meters 1 hour after all three have started moving? Compute the result using the operation ((17 / 21) + (20 / 24)) for the first two snails' distance, and multiply this result by (18 / 17) for the total distance , including the third snail.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the distances covered by each snail in one hour and then add them together.

Given information:
- The first snail covers 17/21 meters in an hour.
- The second snail covers 20/24 meters in an hour.
- The third snail covers 18/17 meters in an hour.
- The first snail started an hour earlier than the second snail.
- The third snail started at the same time as the second snail.

Step 1: Find the distance covered by the first snail in one hour.
Distance covered by the first snail = 17/21 meters

Step 2: Find the distance covered by the second and third snails in one hour.
Distance covered by the second snail = 20/24 meters
Distance covered by the third snail = 18/17 meters

Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered by all three snails in one hour.
Total distance = Distance covered by the first snail + Distance covered by the second and third snails
Total distance = (17/21) + ((20/24) + (18/17))
Total distance = (17/21) + ((20/24) Ã— (18/17))
Total distance = (17/21) + (20/24 Ã— 18/17)
Total distance = (17/21) + (340/408)
Total distance = (17/21) + (17/21)
Total distance = (34/21) meters

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the original amount of fabric and the remaining fabric, and then multiply it by 15/2.

Given information:
- Johnny had 24/14 yards of fabric initially.
- After making some stuffed animals, he had 9/29 yards of fabric left.
- He used 15/2 times the difference of the original and remaining fabric to make more stuffed animals with a new type of fabric.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
24/14 = 48/28 yards (original amount of fabric)
9/29 = 8/28 yards (remaining fabric)

Step 2: Find the difference between the original amount of fabric and the remaining fabric.
Difference = Original amount - Remaining amount
Difference = 48/28 - 8/28
Difference = 40/28 yards

Step 3: Multiply the difference by 15/2.
Amount of new fabric used = Difference Ã— 15/2
Amount of new fabric used = (40/28) Ã— (15/2)
Amount of new fabric used = (40 Ã— 15) / (28 Ã— 2)
Amount of new fabric used = 600 / 56
Amount of new fabric used = 10.714 yards

Therefore, Johnny used 10.714 yards of the new fabric to make more stuffed animals.

Step 1: Find the average number of eggs per nest for the first group of 3 nests.
Total eggs in the first group = 12
Number of nests in the first group = 3
Average number of eggs per nest in the first group = Total eggs / Number of nests

Average number of eggs per nest in the second group = Total eggs / Number of nests
Average number of eggs per nest in the second group = 11 / 4 = 2.75 eggs

Step 3: Find the difference between the average number of eggs per nest for the two groups.

- The starfish laid 1 egg in each of the other 4 nests.

Step 1: Find the average number of eggs per nest for the first group of 3 nests.
Total eggs in the first group = 12
Number of nests in the first group = 3
Average number of eggs per nest in the first group = Total eggs / Number of nests
Average number of eggs per nest in the first group = 12 / 3 = 4 eggs

Step 2: Find the average number of eggs per nest for the second group of 4 nests.
Total eggs in the second group = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
Number of nests in the second group = 4
Average number of eggs per nest in the second group = Total eggs / Number of nests
Average number of eggs per nest in the second group = 4 / 4 = 1 egg

Step 3: Find the difference between the average number of eggs per nest for the two groups.
Difference = Average for the first group - Average for the second group

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the fraction of the pile that the monkey ate and the fraction he gave to his friend, and then subtract their sum from 1 to find the remaining fraction of the pile.

Given information:
- The monkey ate (22/7) Ã— (10/25) of the pile.
- The monkey gave (3/28) of the pile to his friend.

Step 1: Find the fraction of the pile that the monkey ate.
(22/7) Ã— (10/25) = (220/175) = 1.257 (approximately)

Step 2: Find the fraction of the pile that the monkey gave to his friend.
(3/28)

Step 3: Find the total fraction of the pile that the monkey ate and gave away.
Fraction eaten + Fraction given away = (220/175) + (3/28) = (220 Ã— 4 + 3)/700 = 883/700

Step 4: Find the remaining fraction of the pile.
Remaining fraction = 1 - Total fraction eaten and given away
Remaining fraction = 1 - (883/700) = 117/700

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the distance covered by the mouse given its speed and the time it runs.

Given information:
- The mouse runs at a speed of 24/20 feet per second.
- The mouse runs for 23/2 seconds.

Step 1: Convert the speed to a proper fraction.
Speed = 24/20 feet per second
Speed = 6/5 feet per second

Step 2: Convert the time to a proper fraction.
Time = 23/2 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the distance covered by multiplying the speed and time.
Distance = Speed Ã— Time
Distance = (6/5 feet per second) Ã— (23/2 seconds)
Distance = (6 Ã— 23) / (5 Ã— 2) feet
Distance = 138 / 10 feet
Distance = 13.8 feet

Therefore, the mouse runs 13.8 feet in 23/2 seconds.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the total distance the mouse runs, we need to add the initial distance and the additional distance.

Given information:
- The initial distance the mouse ran is 13.8 feet.
- The additional distance the mouse ran is 26/17 feet.

Step 1: Convert the additional distance to a decimal.
Additional distance = 26/17 feet
Additional distance = 1.529411764705882 feet (rounded to 6 decimal places)

Step 2: Calculate the total distance by adding the initial distance and the additional distance.
Total distance = Initial distance + Additional distance
Total distance = 13.8 feet + 1.529411764705882 feet
Total distance = 15.329411764705882 feet

Therefore, the total distance the mouse runs is 15.329411764705882 feet.

Given information:
- Each glass contains 29/9 ounces of beverage.
- 26/25 of the glasses were consumed initially.
- An additional 2/19 ounces of beverages were consumed.

Step 1: Find the number of ounces of beverage consumed initially.
Number of ounces of beverage in each glass = 29/9 ounces
Number of glasses consumed initially = 26/25
Number of ounces of beverage consumed initially = (29/9) Ã— (26/25)
Number of ounces of beverage consumed initially = (29 Ã— 26) / (9 Ã— 25)
Number of ounces of beverage consumed initially = 754 / 225
Number of ounces of beverage consumed initially = 3.35111... ounces

Step 2: Find the total number of ounces of beverages consumed at the party.
Total ounces of beverages consumed = Number of ounces of beverage consumed initially + Additional amount consumed
Total ounces of beverages consumed = 3.35111... ounces + 2/19 ounces
Total ounces of beverages consumed = (3.35111... Ã— 19 + 2) / 19

Given information:
- You added 7/15 of a new set of toothbrushes to your current collection.
- Your friend gifted you 9 more sets.
- You can fit 26/27 of the total sets in your display case.

Step 1: Find the total number of sets of toothbrushes.
Total sets = Initial sets + Sets added (7/15) + Sets gifted by friend
Total sets = 0 + 7/15 + 9
Total sets = 9 + 7/15

Step 2: Convert the mixed number (9 + 7/15) to an improper fraction.
9 + 7/15 = (9 Ã— 15 + 7) / 15
= 142 / 15

Step 3: Calculate how many sets can fit in the display case based on the given fraction (26/27).
Sets that can fit in the display case = (26/27) Ã— (142/15)
= (26 Ã— 142) / (27 Ã— 15)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to convert the weights to the same unit (either kilograms or fractions) and then add them together.

Given information:
- The empty backpack weighs 27/20 kilograms.
- The book weighs 1/6 kilograms.

Step 1: Convert the weight of the empty backpack to a fraction with the same denominator as the book's weight.
27/20 kilograms = (27/20) Ã— (6/6) = 81/120 kilograms

Step 2: Add the weight of the book to the weight of the empty backpack.
Weight of the backpack with the book = Weight of the empty backpack + Weight of the book
Weight of the backpack with the book = 81/120 + 1/6
Weight of the backpack with the book = (81/120 + 10/120)
Weight of the backpack with the book = 91/120 kilograms

Step 3: Simplify the fraction if possible.
91/120 = (91/3)/40 = 31/40 kilograms

Therefore, the total weight of the backpack with the book is 31/40 kilograms.

Next, we can simplify (25/22) by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1:
(25/22) = (25/22)

Now, we can multiply the two simplified fractions:
1 * (25/22) = (25/22)

Therefore, the multiplier of the new bottle compared to the old one is (25/22).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of all the food sources Tilly found and express it as a simplified fraction.

Given information:
- Tilly gathered 25/9 kg of sea plants initially.
- She then found 8/13 kg more.
- In a close-by rock, she spotted another food stash weighing 24/27 kg.
- After that, she stumbled upon yet another food source weighing 21/26 kg.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) for all the fractions.
LCD = 9 Ã— 13 Ã— 27 Ã— 26 = 63,063

Step 2: Convert all fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
25/9 = (25 Ã— 7,007) / 63,063 = 175,175 / 63,063
8/13 = (8 Ã— 4,851) / 63,063 = 38,808 / 63,063
24/27 = (24 Ã— 2,336) / 63,063 = 56,064 / 63,063
21/26 = (21 Ã— 2,426) / 63,063 = 51,146 / 63,063

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
Total food = (175,175 + 38,808 + 56,064 + 51,146) / 63,063
Total food = 321,193 / 63,063

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
GCF of 321,193 and 63,063 = 3
321,193 / 3 = 107,064
63,063 / 3 = 21,021

Therefore, the total food Tilly has in simplified fraction form is 107,064 / 21,021 kg.

The distance to the island is 17/2 nautical miles, and his boat is currently 4/2 nautical miles away from the island. 

Next, Captain Alf adjusts for the tide, which he has estimated to push his boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles. He adds this to his previous calculations.

Finally, when considering his fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon, Captain Alf multiplies his adjusted distance by this rate to figure out his fuel requirements.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow the given steps and perform the calculations using the provided fractions.

Step 1: Calculate the difference in Captain Alf's current location and the distance of the nearby island.
Distance to the island = 17/2 nautical miles
Captain Alf's current distance from the island = 4/2 nautical miles
Difference = 17/2 - 4/2 = 13/2 nautical miles

Step 2: Adjust for the tide, which pushes the boat off course by 14/9 nautical miles.
Adjusted distance = 13/2 + 14/9 nautical miles
To add these fractions, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD), which is 18.
13/2 = 117/18 and 14/9 = 28/18
Adjusted distance = 117/18 + 28/18 = 145/18 nautical miles

Step 3: Consider the fuel efficiency rated at 22/15 nautical miles per gallon.
Fuel requirement = Adjusted distance / Fuel efficiency
Fuel requirement = (145/18) / (22/15)
To divide these fractions, we need to find the reciprocal of the second fraction and then multiply.
Reciprocal of 22/15 = 15/22
Fuel requirement = (145/18) Ã— (15/22) = 2175/396 gallons

Therefore, Captain Alf's final calculation for his fuel requirement is 2175/396 gallons.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the distance the forest ranger patrolled in the morning and then subtract 2/18 miles from it to find the distance patrolled in the afternoon.

Given information:
- The forest ranger patrolled 14/3 miles of trails in the morning.
- In the afternoon, he patrolled 2/18 mile less than what he walked in the morning.

Step 1: Convert the mixed fraction 14/3 to an improper fraction.
14/3 = (14 Ã— 3 + 0) / 3 = 42/3 miles

Step 2: Convert 2/18 to a fraction with the same denominator as 42/3.
2/18 = (2 Ã— 3) / (18 Ã— 3) = 6/54 miles

Step 3: Subtract 6/54 miles from 42/3 miles to find the distance patrolled in the afternoon.
42/3 - 6/54 = (42 Ã— 18 - 6 Ã— 3) / (3 Ã— 18)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the time Arthur practices on a regular day and the additional time he practices on weekends.

Given information:
- Arthur practices piano for 20/21 of an hour every day.
- On weekends, he practices an additional 11/29 of an hour per day.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to decimals.
20/21 of an hour = (20/21) Ã— 1 hour = 0.9523 hours
11/29 of an hour = (11/29) Ã— 1 hour = 0.3793 hours

Step 2: Find the total time Arthur practices on weekends.
Total time on weekends = Time on a regular day + Additional time on weekends
Total time on weekends = 0.9523 hours + 0.3793 hours
Total time on weekends = 1.3316 hours

Therefore, Arthur spends a total of 1.3316 hours practicing the piano each day on the weekend.

Given information:
- Initially, Lucas had 18 shirts, which he divided equally among his 3 siblings.
- Later, he bought 27 more shirts and decided to keep 1/19 of those shirts for each sibling.

Step 1: Find the number of shirts each sibling initially received.
Number of shirts each sibling initially received = 18 / 3 = 6 shirts

Step 2: Find the number of shirts each sibling received from the new batch of 27 shirts.
Number of shirts each sibling received from the new batch = 27 / 19 = 1.421... shirts (rounded down to 1 shirt)

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the initial number of shirts and the new number of shirts for each sibling.
Difference = Initial number of shirts - New number of shirts
Difference = (18 / 3) - (27 / 19)
Difference = 6 - 1.421...
Difference = 4.579... shirts (rounded to 5 shirts)

Therefore, each sibling now has 5 more shirts compared to before.

Given information:
- The painter mixed 7 gallons of white paint with 2/5 gallon of blue paint to make light blue paint.
- The painter used 18/4 gallons (or 4.5 gallons) of the light blue paint for a project.

Step 1: Find the total amount of light blue paint initially.
Total amount of light blue paint = Amount of white paint + Amount of blue paint
Total amount of light blue paint = 7 gallons + 2/5 gallon
Total amount of light blue paint = 7 + 0.4 gallons
Total amount of light blue paint = 7.4 gallons

Step 2: Find the amount of light blue paint left after using 4.5 gallons for the project.
Amount of light blue paint left = Total amount of light blue paint - Amount used for the project
Amount of light blue paint left = 7.4 gallons - 4.5 gallons
Amount of light blue paint left = 2.9 gallons

Therefore, the painter has 2.9 gallons of light blue paint left after using 4.5 gallons for the project.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of light blue paint the painter had initially with the new amount of white paint, and then subtract the amount used for the project.

Given information:
- The painter initially had 24 gallons of white paint.
- The painter mixed 2/5 gallon of blue paint with the white paint to make light blue paint.
- The painter used 18/4 gallons (or 4.5 gallons) of the light blue paint for a project.

Step 1: Find the total amount of light blue paint initially.
Total amount of light blue paint = Amount of white paint + Amount of blue paint
Total amount of light blue paint = 24 gallons + 2/5 gallon
Total amount of light blue paint = 24 + 0.4 gallons
Total amount of light blue paint = 24.4 gallons

Step 2: Find the amount of light blue paint left after using 4.5 gallons for the project.
Amount of light blue paint left = Total amount of light blue paint - Amount used for the project
Amount of light blue paint left = 24.4 gallons - 4.5 gallons
Amount of light blue paint left = 19.9 gallons

Therefore, with the initial 24 gallons of white paint, after mixing 2/5 gallon of blue paint and using 4.5 gallons of the resulting light blue paint for a project, the painter has 19.9 gallons of light blue paint left.

- On the first day, the dolphin jumped 3/4 of its usual height.
- On the second day, the dolphin's jumping height was reduced by 14/25 feet from the first day.

Step 1: Find the dolphin's jumping height on the first day.
Usual jumping height = 18/3 feet = 6 feet
Jumping height on the first day = 3/4 Ã— 6 feet = 4.5 feet

Step 2: Find the dolphin's jumping height on the second day by subtracting 14/25 feet from the first day's height.
Jumping height on the second day = Jumping height on the first day - 14/25 feet
Jumping height on the second day = 4.5 feet - 14/25 feet
Jumping height on the second day = (4.5 Ã— 25 - 14) / 25 feet
Jumping height on the second day = (112.5 - 14) / 25 feet
Jumping height on the second day = 98.5 / 25 feet

- For every 22 pens she advertised, 27 were interested customers.
- For each 23 pens she produced this week, she was able to sell 8.

Step 1: Find the ratio of last month's sales to production.
Ratio of sales to production = (20/15) + (16/22)
Ratio of sales to production = (40/30) + (48/66)
Ratio of sales to production = (88/96) + (48/66)

Step 2: Find the ratio of interested customers to production this week.
Ratio of interested customers to production = (22/27) Ã— (23/8)
Ratio of interested customers to production = (506/216)

Step 3: Multiply the two ratios.

Given information:
- The musician played a song for 30 minutes.
- The time was divided equally among 15 songs.
- The time spent on a particular song was reduced by 1/17 of an hour.

Step 1: Find the average time spent on each song.
Total time = 30 minutes
Number of songs = 15
Average time per song = Total time / Number of songs
Average time per song = 30 minutes / 15
Average time per song = 2 minutes

Step 2: Convert 1/17 of an hour to minutes.
1/17 of an hour = (1/17) Ã— 60 minutes
1/17 of an hour = 3.53 minutes (approximately)

Step 3: Subtract 1/17 of an hour from the average time per song to find the final duration of the particular song.
Final duration of the particular song = Average time per song - 1/17 of an hour
Final duration of the particular song = 2 minutes - 3.53 minutes
Final duration of the particular song = -1.53 minutes

Note: The negative value indicates that the final duration of the particular song is less than the average time per song by 1.53 minutes.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours Josh and Jack rode the scooters, and then express it as a simplified fraction.

Given information:
- Josh rode the scooter for 18 hours on the first day.
- Josh rode the scooter for an additional 1/12 of an hour on the second day.
- Jack rode the scooter for 7/17 of an hour.

Step 1: Find the total number of hours Josh rode the scooter.
Josh's total hours = 18 + 1/12 = (18 Ã— 12 + 1) / 12 = 217/12 hours

Step 2: Find the total number of hours Josh and Jack rode the scooters.
Total hours = Josh's total hours + Jack's hours
Total hours = 217/12 + 7/17

Step 3: Find the common denominator for the fractions.
Common denominator = Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12 and 17
LCM of 12 and 17 = 204

Step 4: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
217/12 = (217 Ã— 17) / (12 Ã— 17) = 3689/204
7/17 = (7 Ã— 12) / (17 Ã— 12) = 84/204

Step 5: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
Total hours = 3689/204 + 84/204 = 3773/204

Step 6: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours Josh, Jack, and Maria rode the scooters, and then express it as a simplified fraction.

Given information:
- Josh rode the scooter for 217/12 hours.
- Jack rode the scooter for 7/17 hours.
- Maria rode the scooter for 1/21 hours.

Step 1: Find the common denominator for the fractions.
Common denominator = Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12, 17, and 21
LCM of 12, 17, and 21 = 1092

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
217/12 = (217 Ã— 91) / (12 Ã— 91) = 19747/1092
7/17 = (7 Ã— 64) / (17 Ã— 64) = 448/1092
1/21 = (1 Ã— 52) / (21 Ã— 52) = 52/1092

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
Total hours = 19747/1092 + 448/1092 + 52/1092 = 20247/1092

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
GCF of 20247 and 1092 = 3
20247/1092 = (20247/3) / (1092/3) = 6749/364

Therefore, Josh, Jack, and Maria rode the scooters for a total of 6749/364 hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the fractions representing the different types of lamps and then simplify the resulting fraction.

Given information:
- 4/26 of the lamps are floor lamps.
- 15/11 of the lamps are desk lamps.
- 23/28 of the lamps are table lamps.
- 8/19 of the lamps are decorative lamps.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) for all the fractions.
LCD = 26 Ã— 11 Ã— 28 Ã— 19 = 14,812

Step 2: Convert all fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
Floor lamps = (4/26) Ã— (14,812/14,812) = 228/14,812
Desk lamps = (15/11) Ã— (14,812/14,812) = 2,028/14,812
Table lamps = (23/28) Ã— (14,812/14,812) = 1,188/14,812
Decorative lamps = (8/19) Ã— (14,812/14,812) = 624/14,812

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
228 + 2,028 + 1,188 + 624 = 4,068

Step 4: Express the sum as a fraction with the LCD as the denominator.
4,068/14,812

Therefore, the fraction of the total inventory that these lamps constitute is 4,068/14,812.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the combined length of the two kite strings and then calculate 5/8 of that length.

Given information:
- Oliver has a kite string that is 26/19 meters long.
- Oliver has another kite string that is 7/11 meters long.
- He wants to use 5/8 of the combined length of the two strings.

Step 1: Find the combined length of the two kite strings.
Combined length = Length of string 1 + Length of string 2
Combined length = 26/19 meters + 7/11 meters

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

LCD of 19 and 11 = 209
26/19 = (26 Ã— 11)/209
7/11 = (7 Ã— 19)/209

Combined length = (26 Ã— 11)/209 + (7 Ã— 19)/209
Combined length = 286/209 + 133/209
Combined length = 419/209 meters

Step 2: Calculate 5/8 of the combined length.
5/8 of the combined length = (5/8) Ã— (419/209)
5/8 of the combined length = (5 Ã— 419)/(8 Ã— 209)
5/8 of the combined length = 2095/1672 meters

Therefore, the kite string that Oliver is using now is 2095/1672 meters long.

- He wants to double the length of the kite string he used earlier.

Step 1: Find the length of the kite string Oliver used earlier.
Length of the kite string used earlier = 2095/1672 meters

Step 2: Double the length of the kite string used earlier.
Total length of the kite string Oliver is now using = 2 Ã— (2095/1672) meters
Total length of the kite string Oliver is now using = (2 Ã— 2095)/1672 meters
Total length of the kite string Oliver is now using = 4190/1672 meters

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the combined length of the two kite strings and then calculate 26/8 of that length.

Given information:
- Oliver has a kite string that is 26/19 meters long.
- Oliver has another kite string that is 7/11 meters long.
- He wants to use 26/8 of the combined length of the two strings.

Step 1: Find the combined length of the two kite strings.
Combined length = Length of string 1 + Length of string 2
Combined length = 26/19 meters + 7/11 meters

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

LCD of 19 and 11 = 209
26/19 = (26 Ã— 11)/209
7/11 = (7 Ã— 19)/209

Combined length = (26 Ã— 11)/209 + (7 Ã— 19)/209
Combined length = 286/209 + 133/209
Combined length = 419/209 meters

Step 2: Calculate 26/8 of the combined length.
26/8 of the combined length = (26/8) Ã— (419/209)
26/8 of the combined length = (26 Ã— 419)/(8 Ã— 209)
26/8 of the combined length = 10894/1672 meters

Therefore, the kite string that Oliver is using now is 10894/1672 meters long.

Given information:
- Mike threw 9/19 of his snowballs.
- John threw 6/8 of his snowballs.
- Mike found 4 more snowballs to throw.
- 'u' represents the number of snowballs thrown by both Mike and John.
- 'j' is the total number of snowballs Mike had after finding more.

Step 1: Find the value of 'u'.
u = 9/19 + 6/8
u = (9/19) + (6/8)
u = (9 Ã— 8/19 Ã— 8) + (6 Ã— 19/8 Ã— 19)

u = 186/152
u = 1.224 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Step 2: Find the value of 'j'.
j = u + 4/1
j = 1.224 + 4

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to follow the given steps and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- First recipe: (27 / 3) cups of flour and (11 / 7) cups of sugar.
- Ratio of flour to sugar = (27 / 3) / (11 / 7)
- Subtract (21 / 26) from the ratio.
- Add (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe.

Step 1: Calculate the ratio of flour to sugar in the first recipe.
Ratio of flour to sugar = (27 / 3) / (11 / 7)
                        = (27 Ã— 7) / (3 Ã— 11)
                        = 189 / 33
                        = 5.72727...

Step 2: Subtract (21 / 26) from the ratio.
Ratio after subtraction = 5.72727... - (21 / 26)
                         = 5.72727... - 0.80769...
                         = 4.91958...

Step 3: Add (22 / 9) cups of flour from the second recipe.
Total cups of flour = 4.91958... + (22 / 9)
                    = 4.91958... + 2.44444...
                    = 7.36402...

Therefore, Debra will have approximately 7.36 cups of flour in the end.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of chickens in each farm initially, calculate the difference between them, and then multiply the result by 19/21 to account for the new chickens born.

Given information:
- There are 26/13 chickens in one farm.
- There are 9/16 chickens in another farm.
- The number of chickens multiplied by 19/21 due to new chickens born after a week.

Step 1: Find the number of chickens in the first farm.
26/13 = 2 chickens in the first farm

Step 2: Find the number of chickens in the second farm.
9/16 = 9/16 = 0.5625 chickens in the second farm

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of chickens in the two farms.
Difference = Number of chickens in the first farm - Number of chickens in the second farm
Difference = 2 - 0.5625 = 1.4375 chickens

Step 4: Multiply the difference by 19/21 to account for the new chickens born.
Number of chickens after a week = Difference Ã— 19/21
Number of chickens after a week = 1.4375 Ã— 19/21
Number of chickens after a week = 1.3035 chickens

Therefore, there are 1.3035 chickens in Farmer John's farm after a week.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the value of 'w' first, which represents the distance flown for each exercise.

Given information:
- The helicopter traveled a distance of 24/14 miles for the first exercise.
- The helicopter flew the same distance for the second exercise.
- Let 'w' be the distance flown for each exercise.
- Let 't' be the total distance flown for both exercises, represented as the product of 'w' times 'w'.

Step 1: Find the value of 'w'.
Distance flown for each exercise = 24/14 miles
w = 24/14 miles

Step 2: Find the value of 't'.
t = w Ã— w
t = (24/14) Ã— (24/14)
t = (24 Ã— 24) / (14 Ã— 14)
t = 576 / 196
t = (9/4) Ã— (9/4)
t = 81/16

Therefore, the value of 't', which represents the total distance flown for both exercises, is 81/16 miles squared.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the fractions of the fuel tank filled during the two stops.

Given information:
- During the first stop, the UFO filled 20/16 of its fuel tank.
- During the second stop, the UFO filled 24/25 of its fuel tank.

Step 1: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a common denominator.
Common denominator = 16 Ã— 25 = 400

20/16 = 125/400 (multiplied the numerator and denominator by 25)
24/25 = 96/400 (multiplied the numerator and denominator by 16)

Step 2: Add the fractions.
Total fraction of the tank filled = 125/400 + 96/400
                                 = 221/400

Step 3: Simplify the fraction (if possible).
221/400 = 0.5525 (dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 11)

Therefore, the total fraction of the tank that the UFO was able to refill during these two stops is 221/400 or 0.5525.

            Professor Astro is working on his telescope. He believes the power of his telescope is directly proportional to the sum of two fractions. The first fraction is the light gathering power of the lens, which is 24 out of 27. The second fraction is the zooming potential, which is 30 out of 26. So, Professor Astro calculates the sum of these two fractions ((24 / 27) + (30 / 26)). What does he find?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the two fractions (24/27) and (30/26).

First, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 27 and 26 is 702.

Now, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 702:
* 24/27 = (24 Ã— 26)/702 = 624/702
* 30/26 = (30 Ã— 27)/702 = 810/702

Now, we can add the fractions:
(624/702) + (810/702) = 1434/702

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 6.

1434/702 = (1434/6) / (702/6) = 239/117

Therefore, the sum of the two fractions is 239/117.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the two fractions (12/27) and (30/26).

First, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 27 and 26 is 702.

Now, we can convert both fractions to have a denominator of 702:
* 12/27 = (12 Ã— 26)/702 = 312/702
* 30/26 = (30 Ã— 27)/702 = 810/702

Now, we can add the fractions:
(312/702) + (810/702) = 1122/702

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 6.

1122/702 = (1122/6) / (702/6) = 187/117

Therefore, the sum of the two fractions is 187/117.

Given information:
- Kiki ate 11/6 bananas in the morning.
- Kiki ate the same amount of bananas in the afternoon as in the morning.

Step 1: Find the total number of bananas Kiki ate.
Bananas eaten in the morning = 11/6
Bananas eaten in the afternoon = 11/6
Total bananas eaten = Bananas eaten in the morning + Bananas eaten in the afternoon
Total bananas eaten = 11/6 + 11/6
Total bananas eaten = 22/6

Step 2: Express the total number of bananas eaten as an improper fraction.
22/6 = (22 Ã· 6) + (22 % 6)/6
22/6 = 3 + 4/6
22/6 = 19/6
