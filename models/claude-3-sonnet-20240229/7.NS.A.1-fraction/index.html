        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the two fractions (74/63) and (91/78).

First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 63 and 78. The LCD is the smallest positive number that is divisible by both denominators.

To find the LCD, we can use the prime factorization method:
63 = 3^2 Ã— 7
78 = 2 Ã— 3^2 Ã— 13

The LCD is the product of the highest powers of each prime factor present in either denominator:
LCD = 2 Ã— 3^2 Ã— 7 Ã— 13 = 1,386

Now, we need to convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

(74/63) = (74 Ã— 22/63 Ã— 22) = 1,628/1,386
(91/78) = (91 Ã— 17/78 Ã— 17) = 1,547/1,386

Now, we can add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:
(1,628/1,386) + (1,547/1,386) = (1,628 + 1,547)/1,386 = 3,175/1,386

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 3,175 and 1,386 is 1.

Therefore, the sum of (74/63) and (91/78) is 3,175/1,386.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find a common denominator and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 25 is 25.

Converting 94/5 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 25:
94/5 = (94 Ã— 5)/25 = 470/25

Now we can add the fractions:
470/25 + 1/25 = (470 + 1)/25 = 471/25

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 1.

Therefore, the result is:
471/25

            <span class="response-field">Claude-3 Sonnet:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. From the previous problem, we have 471/25.

2. We need to add 73/89 to 471/25.

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

The LCM of 25 and 89 is 2225.

Converting 471/25 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 2225:
471/25 = (471 Ã— 89)/2225 = 41,859/2225

Converting 73/89 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 2225:
73/89 = (73 Ã— 25)/2225 = 1,825/2225

Now we can add the fractions:
41,859/2225 + 1,825/2225 = (41,859 + 1,825)/2225 = 43,684/2225

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator and divide both by the GCD.

The GCD of 43,684 and 2225 is 17.

43,684/2225 = (43,684/17) / (2225/17) = 2,575 / 131

Therefore, the final result is:
2,575/131

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given:
- First fraction: 94/89
- Second fraction: 1/25

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

The LCM of 89 and 25 is 2225.

Converting the fractions to equivalent fractions with denominator 2225:
- 94/89 = (94 Ã— 25)/2225 = 2350/2225
- 1/25 = (1 Ã— 89)/2225 = 89/2225

Now we can add the fractions:
2350/2225 + 89/2225 = (2350 + 89)/2225 = 2439/2225

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator and divide both by the GCD.

The GCD of 2439 and 2225 is 1.

Therefore, the simplified result is:
2439/2225

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple of 20 and 8 is 40.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 40:
48/20 = 48/20 * 2/2 = 96/40
49/8 = 49/8 * 5/5 = 245/40

Now we can subtract:
245/40 - 96/40 = 149/40

To simplify 149/40, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 149/40.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 56:
48/14 = 48/14 * 4/4 = 192/56
49/8 = 49/8 * 7/7 = 343/56

Now we can subtract:
343/56 - 192/56 = 151/56

To simplify 151/56, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 49 and 35.
The LCM of 49 and 35 is 1715.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1715.
22/49 = (22 Ã— 35)/1715 = 770/1715
72/35 = (72 Ã— 49)/1715 = 3528/1715

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(770/1715) + (3528/1715) = 4298/1715

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 4298 and 1715 is 7.
4298/1715 = (4298/7)/(1715/7) = 613/245

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of 49/79 and 18/21, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 79 and 21 is 1659.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1659.

49/79 = (49 Ã— 21)/1659 = 1029/1659
18/21 = (18 Ã— 79)/1659 = 1422/1659

Now we can add the fractions:
1029/1659 + 1422/1659 = 2451/1659

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3.

2451/1659 = (2451/3)/(1659/3) = 817/553

Therefore, the sum of 49/79 and 18/21 is 817/553.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we found that the sum of 49/79 and 18/21 is 817/553.

Let's denote this sum as n:
n = 817/553

Now, we need to add 71/97 to n.

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.

The LCM of 553 and 97 is 53641.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 53641.

n = 817/553 = (817 Ã— 97)/53641 = 79049/53641
71/97 = (71 Ã— 553)/53641 = 39323/53641

Now we can add the fractions:
79049/53641 + 39323/53641 = 118372/53641

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 7.

118372/53641 = (118372/7)/(53641/7) = 16910/7661

Therefore, the result of adding 71/97 to n (the sum of 49/79 and 18/21) is 16910/7661.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 21 is 63.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 63.

49/3 = (49 Ã— 21)/63 = 1029/63
18/21 = (18 Ã— 3)/63 = 54/63

Now we can add the fractions:
1029/63 + 54/63 = 1083/63

95/46 = (95 Ã— 31)/1426 = 2945/1426
65/31 = (65 Ã— 46)/1426 = 2990/1426

Now we can add the fractions:
2945/1426 + 2990/1426 = 5935/1426

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 7.

70 / 25 = 2.8

Now, we can add these two values together:

To express the answer in its simplest form, we need to convert the repeating decimal to a fraction.

4.8606... = 4 + 0.8606...
0.8606... = 8606/9999 (the repeating part is 06, so we have 86 over 99)

Therefore, 4.8606... = 4 + (8606/9999)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the sum of 35/97 and 11/9, which we calculated earlier as 1382/873.

2. Now, we need to add 11/25 to this sum.

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert all fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

The LCD of 873 and 25 is 21825.

So, we convert the fractions as follows:
1382/873 = (1382 Ã— 25)/21825
11/25 = (11 Ã— 873)/21825

3. Now we can add the numerators:
(1382 Ã— 25)/21825 + (11 Ã— 873)/21825
= 34550/21825 + 9603/21825
= 44153/21825

4. Finally, we simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.

The GCF of 44153 and 21825 is 1.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 44153/21825.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of two fractions, we need to find a common denominator and then add the fractions.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 97 and 15.
LCM of 97 and 15 = 1455

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1455.
35/97 = (35 Ã— 15)/1455
11/15 = (11 Ã— 97)/1455

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
(35 Ã— 15)/1455 + (11 Ã— 97)/1455 = 525/1455 + 1067/1455 = 1592/1455

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and then dividing both by the GCF.
GCF of 1592 and 1455 = 1
1592/1455 = 1592/1 Ã— 1/1455 = 1592/1455

So, we convert 11/5 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 70:

Now we can subtract the fractions:
154/70 - 79/70 = (154 - 79)/70 = 75/70

To convert the fraction to a mixed number, we divide the numerator by the denominator:

1. The previous answer from subtracting 79/70 from 11/5 was 1 5/70.

2. To add 62/46 to 1 5/70, we need to find a common denominator for 70 and 46.
   The least common multiple of 70 and 46 is 1610.

3. Convert 1 5/70 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 1610:
   1 5/70 = (1 * 23)/70 + 5/70 = 23/1610 + 5/1610 = 28/1610

4. Convert 62/46 to an equivalent fraction with denominator 1610:
   62/46 = (62 * 35)/1610 = 2170/1610

5. Add the fractions:
   28/1610 + 2170/1610 = 2198/1610

6. Convert the fraction to a mixed number:
   2198/1610 = 1 + 588/1610

Given information:
- Jane will buy 60/45 kilograms of apples.
- Jane will buy 37/47 kilograms of oranges.

Step 1: Find a common denominator for the fractions.
The least common multiple (LCM) of 45 and 47 is 945.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to have the same denominator of 945.
60/45 = (60 Ã— 21)/945 = 1260/945 kilograms of apples
37/47 = (37 Ã— 20)/945 = 740/945 kilograms of oranges

Step 3: Add the weights of apples and oranges.
Weight of apples + Weight of oranges = Total weight
1260/945 + 740/945 = 2000/945 kilograms

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 5.
2000/945 = 400/189 kilograms

Therefore, the total weight of the apples and oranges that Jane will buy is 400/189 kilograms.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 84/97 and 25/2, we need to first find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 97 and 2 is 194.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 194.

84/97 = (84 Ã— 2)/194 = 168/194
25/2 = (25 Ã— 97)/194 = 2425/194

Now we can add the fractions:
168/194 + 2425/194 = (168 + 2425)/194
= 2593/194

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 1.

Therefore, the sum of 84/97 and 25/2 is 2593/194.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we found the sum of 84/97 and 25/2, which is 2593/194.

2. Now, we need to subtract 100/71 from 2593/194.

To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 2593/194 and 100/71.
The LCM of 194 and 71 is 13774.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 13774.
2593/194 = (2593 Ã— 71)/13774 = 183083/13774
100/71 = (100 Ã— 194)/13774 = 19400/13774

Now we can subtract:
183083/13774 - 19400/13774 = (183083 - 19400)/13774
= 163683/13774

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their GCF, which is 3.

163683/13774 = (163683/3)/(13774/3)
= 54561/4591

Therefore, after subtracting 100/71 from the sum of 84/97 and 25/2, the new result is 54561/4591.

            After previously finding the sum of 84/97 and 25/2, now consider a new scenario. What if, instead of having 84 parts out of 97, we had 84 parts out of 96? What then would be the sum of these fractions: 84/96 and 25/2?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this new scenario.

Given:
- The first fraction is 84/96 (instead of 84/97)
- The second fraction is still 25/2

To find the sum, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 96 and 2 is 96.

So, we can convert the second fraction to have a denominator of 96.

84/96 (no need to convert)
25/2 = (25 Ã— 48)/96 = 1200/96

Now we can add the fractions:
84/96 + 1200/96 = (84 + 1200)/96
= 1284/96

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 4.

1284/96 = (1284/4)/24 = 321/24

Therefore, the sum of 84/96 and 25/2 is 321/24.

2. Now we need to add 6/15 to this result.

3. To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

4. The LCD of 780 and 15 is 3900.

5. Converting the fractions:
   2534/780 = (2534 Ã— 5)/3900 = 12670/3900
   6/15 = (6 Ã— 260)/3900 = 1560/3900

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this modified problem.

Given:
- (77 / 55) + (6 / 79)

Step 1: Calculate (77 / 55)
77 / 55 = 1.4

Step 2: Calculate (6 / 79)
6 / 79 = 0.0759493670886076 (rounded to 10 decimal places)

Step 3: Add the results from Step 1 and Step 2
(77 / 55) + (6 / 79) = 1.4 + 0.0759493670886076 = 1.4759493670886076

To express the result as a fraction, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of 55 and 79, which is 4335.

Step 4: Convert the decimal to a fraction with the denominator 4335
1.4759493670886076 = 6385/4335

Therefore, the result of ((77 / 55) + (6 / 79)) expressed as a fraction is 6385/4335.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 23/20 and 82/97, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 97 is 1940.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1940.

23/20 = (23 Ã— 97)/1940 = 2231/1940
82/97 = (82 Ã— 20)/1940 = 1640/1940

Now we can add the fractions:
(2231/1940) + (1640/1940) = (2231 + 1640)/1940 = 3871/1940

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 11.

3871/1940 = (3871/11)/(1940/11) = 352/176

Therefore, the sum of 23/20 and 82/97 is 352/176.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 88 and 10 is 880.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 880:
54/88 = (54 Ã— 10)/880 = 540/880
28/10 = (28 Ã— 88)/880 = 2464/880

Now we can add the fractions:
540/880 + 2464/880 = 3004/880

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 4.

3004/880 = (3004/4)/(880/4) = 751/220

Therefore, the sum of 54/88 and 28/10 is 751/220.

2. Now, we need to add 751/220 to 21/13.

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is 780 (220 Ã— 13 Ã— 3).

3. Convert the fractions to have a denominator of 780:
751/220 = (751 Ã— 3)/780 = 2253/780
21/13 = (21 Ã— 60)/780 = 1260/780

4. Add the fractions:
2253/780 + 1260/780 = 3513/780

5. Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 3.

3513/780 = (3513/3)/(780/3) = 1171/260

The least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 12 is 60.

Step 1: Convert 82/15 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 60.
82/15 = (82 Ã— 4)/60 = 328/60

Step 2: Convert 100/12 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator 60.
100/12 = (100 Ã— 5)/60 = 500/60

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
328/60 + 500/60 = (328 + 500)/60 = 828/60

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
828/60 = 13 + (28/60) = 13 + (14/30) = 13 + (7/15)

Therefore, the sum of 82/15 and 100/12 is 13 + (7/15).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the result of the expression ((92 / 29) + (41 / 33)), we need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate 92 / 29:
   92 / 29 = 3.172413793... (repeating decimal)
   Converting to a fraction: 92 / 29 = 3 11/29

2. Calculate 41 / 33:
   41 / 33 = 1.242424... (repeating decimal)
   Converting to a fraction: 41 / 33 = 1 8/33

3. Add the fractions:
   (3 11/29) + (1 8/33)
   = (3 + 1) + (11/29 + 8/33)
   = 4 + (11/29 + 8/33)

To add the fractions 11/29 and 8/33, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD).
The LCD of 29 and 33 is 957.

11/29 = 380/957
8/33 = 232/957

380/957 + 232/957 = 612/957

Therefore, (11/29 + 8/33) = 612/957

4. Combine the whole number and the fraction:
   4 + 612/957 = 4 612/957

14/98 = (14 Ã— 28)/2,794 = 392/2,794

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(5,472/2,794) + (392/2,794) = (5,472 + 392)/2,794 = 5,864/2,794

First, we convert both fractions to have the same denominator of 1679:

20/23 = (20 Ã— 73)/1679 = 1460/1679

Now we can add the numerators:
1150/1679 + 1460/1679 = 2610/1679

To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2610 and 1679, which is 1.

1. First, we need to find the result of adding 50/73 and 20/23:
   * We found this in the previous question: 50/73 + 20/23 = 2610/1679

2. Next, we need to add 83/35 to 2610/1679:
   * To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.
   * The LCM of 1679 and 35 is 58765.
   * So we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 58765:
     - 2610/1679 = (2610 Ã— 35)/58765 = 91350/58765
     - 83/35 = (83 Ã— 1679)/58765 = 139577/58765
   * Now we can add the numerators:
     91350/58765 + 139577/58765 = 230927/58765

3. Finally, we simplify the fraction 230927/58765:
   * The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 230927 and 58765 is 1.

23/49 = (23 * 35)/1715 = 805/1715

Now we can subtract:

To simplify the fraction 3801/1715, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 3801 and 1715.

The GCF of 3801 and 1715 is 37.

4) The question asks for the value of 't' added to 't'.
5) Adding a fraction to itself is the same as multiplying the fraction by 2.
6) So 't' added to 't' is the same as (3616/1110) + (3616/1110) = (3616 + 3616)/1110 = 7232/1110.

6013/2650 = (6013/7)/(2650/7) = 859/379

Therefore, the sum of 45/53 and 71/50 is 859/379.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of 36/72 and 49/1, we need to first convert the fractions to have a common denominator.

The least common multiple of 72 and 1 is 72.

36/72 = 36/72 = 1/2
49/1 = 49/72

Now we can add the fractions:
1/2 + 49/72 = (36 + 49)/72 = 85/72

To convert the fraction to a mixed number:
85/72 = 1 + 13/72

Therefore, the sum of 36/72 and 49/1 is 1 + 13/72.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 23 and 26 is 598.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 598:
58/23 = (58 Ã— 26)/598 = 1508/598
25/26 = (25 Ã— 23)/598 = 575/598

Now we can add the numerators:
1508/598 + 575/598 = 2083/598

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.

Therefore, the sum of 58/23 and 25/26 is 2083/598.

            We previously calculated the sum of the fractions 58/23 and 25/26. Now, suppose we had started with 45/23 instead of 58/23. How does the sum of 45/23 and 25/26 compare to the original calculation?

            <span class="response-field">Claude-3 Sonnet:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's calculate the sum of 45/23 and 25/26.

First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 23 and 26, which is 598.

Then, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 598:
45/23 = (45 Ã— 26)/598 = 1170/598
25/26 = (25 Ã— 23)/598 = 575/598

Now we can add the numerators:
1170/598 + 575/598 = 1745/598

To compare this sum to the original calculation of 58/23 + 25/26, we can subtract:
2083/598 - 1745/598 = 338/598

Therefore, the sum of 45/23 and 25/26 is 338/598 less than the sum of 58/23 and 25/26.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of two fractions, we need to find a common denominator and then add the fractions with the same denominator.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 13 and 52.
The LCM of 13 and 52 is 156.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 156.
70/13 = (70 Ã— 12)/156 = 840/156
17/52 = (17 Ã— 3)/156 = 51/156

Step 3: Add the fractions with the same denominator.
(840/156) + (51/156) = 891/156

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
891/156 = 5 (with a remainder of 131/156)
            = 5 + 131/156

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of 78/44 and 17/91, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 44 and 91 is 1,292.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 1,292.

78/44 = (78 Ã— 29)/1,292 = 2,262/1,292
17/91 = (17 Ã— 14)/1,292 = 238/1,292

Now we can add the fractions:
2,262/1,292 + 238/1,292 = (2,262 + 238)/1,292 = 2,500/1,292

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 4.

2,500/1,292 = (2,500/4)/(1,292/4) = 625/323

Therefore, the sum of 78/44 and 17/91 is 625/323.

Now, we can convert both fractions to have the same denominator of 4:
43/4 = 43/4 (no need to change)
71/4 = 71/4 (no need to change)

Next, we add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:
43/4 + 71/4 = (43 + 71)/4
             = 114/4

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 2.

114/4 = (114/2) / (4/2)

Now, we can convert all three fractions to have the same denominator of 316:
43/4 = (43 Ã— 79)/316 = 3397/316
71/4 = (71 Ã— 79)/316 = 5609/316
92/79 = (92 Ã— 4)/316 = 368/316

Next, we add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:
3397/316 + 5609/316 + 368/316 = (3397 + 5609 + 368)/316
                               = 9374/316

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 2.

9374/316 = (9374/2) / (316/2)

Now, we convert both fractions to have the denominator of 356:
43/4 = (43 Ã— 89)/356 = 3827/356
71/89 = (71 Ã— 4)/356 = 284/356

Next, we add the numerators and keep the denominator the same:

To simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 3.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 74 and 27.
LCM of 74 and 27 = 1998

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 1998.
17/74 = (17 Ã— 27)/1998 = 459/1998

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the common denominator.
(459/1998) + (3922/1998) = (459 + 3922)/1998 = 4381/1998

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
4381/1998 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

Step 3: Subtract the two values.

Now, we can subtract the fractions.
(54 / 9) - (5 / 9) = (54 - 5) / 9 = 49 / 9

Therefore, the result of ((94 / 14) - (50 / 90)) as a simplified fraction is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions and then subtract them.

Given:
- 33/7
- 29/79

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 7 and 79.
LCM of 7 and 79 = 553

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 553.
33/7 = (33 Ã— 79)/553 = 2607/553
29/79 = (29 Ã— 7)/553 = 203/553

Step 3: Subtract the fractions.
(2607/553) - (203/553) = 2404/553

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
GCD of 2404 and 553 = 1
2404/553 = (2404/1) / (553/1) = 2404/553

Given:
- The result of subtracting 29/79 from 33/7 is 2404/553
- We need to subtract 61/76 from 2404/553

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 553 and 76.
LCM of 553 and 76 = 21,008

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 21,008.
2404/553 = (2404 Ã— 38)/21,008 = 91,352/21,008
61/76 = (61 Ã— 276)/21,008 = 16,836/21,008

Step 3: Subtract the fractions.
(91,352/21,008) - (16,836/21,008) = 74,516/21,008

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
GCD of 74,516 and 21,008 = 4
74,516/21,008 = (74,516/4) / (21,008/4) = 18,629/5,252

Therefore, the result of subtracting 61/76 from the earlier result of 2404/553 is 18,629/5,252.

The common denominator of 8 and 16 is 16 (the least common multiple of 8 and 16).

So, we need to convert 38/8 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 16.
38/8 = (38 Ã— 2)/16 = 76/16

Now we can add the fractions:
76/16 + 4/16 = (76 + 4)/16 = 80/16

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 16.
80/16 = (80/16) / (16/16) = 5/1 = 5

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. In the previous problem, we found that the sum of 38/8 and 4/16 is 5.

2. To add 32/64 to this sum, we need to convert 5 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 64.
   5 = (5 Ã— 8)/8 = 40/8
   40/8 = (40 Ã— 8)/64 = 320/64

3. Now we can add 32/64 to 320/64:
   320/64 + 32/64 = (320 + 32)/64 = 352/64

4. To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 32.
   352/64 = (352/32) / (64/32) = 11/2

Therefore, if we add 32/64 to the sum of 38/8 and 4/16, the new total is 11/2.

            In the previous problem, we considered the sum of the fractions 38/8 and 4/16 and then added 32/64. Now, instead of 38/8, let's consider 12/8. What would be the new sum if you added 12/8 and 4/16 together?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given fractions: 12/8 and 4/16

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of 8 and 16.
The LCD of 8 and 16 is 16.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
12/8 = (12 Ã— 2)/16 = 24/16
4/16 (no need to convert as the denominator is already 16)

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.
24/16 + 4/16 = (24 + 4)/16 = 28/16

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 28 and 16 is 4.
28/16 = (28/4) / (16/4) = 7/4

Therefore, the sum of 12/8 and 4/16 is 7/4.

            <span class="response-field">Claude-3 Sonnet:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of 38/59 and 80/94, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 59 and 94 is 5546.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 5546.

38/59 = (38 Ã— 94)/5546 = 3572/5546
80/94 = (80 Ã— 59)/5546 = 4720/5546

Now we can add the fractions:
3572/5546 + 4720/5546 = 8292/5546

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.

8292/5546 = (8292/2)/(5546/2) = 4146/2773

Therefore, the sum of 38/59 and 80/94 is 4146/2773.

            <span class="response-field">Claude-3 Sonnet:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the resultant value, we need to first calculate the sum of 38/59 and 80/94, and then add 84/30 to it.

From the previous question, we know that the sum of 38/59 and 80/94 is 4146/2773.

Now, we need to find a common denominator for 4146/2773 and 84/30.

The LCM of 2773 and 30 is 83190.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 83190.

4146/2773 = (4146 Ã— 30)/83190 = 124380/83190
84/30 = (84 Ã— 2773)/83190 = 233532/83190

Now we can add the fractions:
124380/83190 + 233532/83190 = 357912/83190

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their GCD, which is 6.

357912/83190 = (357912/6)/(83190/6) = 59652/13865

Therefore, the resultant value after adding 84/30 to the sum of 38/59 and 80/94 is 59652/13865.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's calculate the sum of 38/39 and 80/94.

First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 39 and 94 to get a common denominator.
The LCM of 39 and 94 is 3666.

Now, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 3666.
38/39 = (38 Ã— 94)/3666 = 3572/3666
80/94 = (80 Ã— 39)/3666 = 3120/3666

Next, we add the fractions:
3572/3666 + 3120/3666 = 6692/3666

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.

6692/3666 = (6692/2)/(3666/2) = 3346/1833

Therefore, the sum of 38/39 and 80/94 is 3346/1833.

The least common multiple of 14 and 20 is 140.

10/14 = (10 Ã— 10)/140 = 100/140
70/20 = (70 Ã— 7)/140 = 490/140

Now we can add the fractions:
100/140 + 490/140 = 590/140

To convert the fraction to a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
590/140 = 4.2142857142857144

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of two fractions, we need to find a common denominator and then add the fractions.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 75 and 58.
The LCM of 75 and 58 is 1450.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator 1450.
49/75 = (49 Ã— 19.3333)/1450 = 946/1450
88/58 = (88 Ã— 25)/1450 = 2200/1450

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
946/1450 + 2200/1450 = (946 + 2200)/1450 = 3146/1450

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
3146/1450 = 2.17

Therefore, the sum of 49/75 and 88/58 is 2.17.

First, we find the values of the fractions:

72 / 100 = 0.72

Now we subtract:

To convert the decimal to a fraction, we follow the same process as before:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the sum of two fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) and convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator. Then, we can add the numerators and keep the LCD as the denominator.

Given fractions: 37/20 and 16/75

Step 1: Find the LCD of 20 and 75.
The LCD is the least common multiple of 20 and 75, which is 300.

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 300.
37/20 = (37 Ã— 15)/300 = 555/300
16/75 = (16 Ã— 4)/300 = 64/300

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the denominator as 300.
555/300 + 64/300 = (555 + 64)/300 = 619/300

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.
The GCF of 619 and 300 is 1.
619/300 = (619/1) / (300/1) = 619/300

Therefore, the sum of 37/20 and 16/75 as a simplified fraction is 619/300.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's add 61/80 to the previously computed sum of 37/20 and 16/75, which was 619/300.

Given:
- Sum of 37/20 and 16/75 = 619/300
- Additional fraction to add: 61/80

Step 1: Find the LCD of 300 and 80.
The LCD is the least common multiple of 300 and 80, which is 1200.

Step 2: Convert all fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 1200.
619/300 = (619 Ã— 4)/1200 = 2476/1200
61/80 = (61 Ã— 15)/1200 = 915/1200

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the denominator as 1200.
2476/1200 + 915/1200 = (2476 + 915)/1200 = 3391/1200

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.
The GCF of 3391 and 1200 is 1.
3391/1200 = (3391/1) / (1200/1) = 3391/1200

Therefore, the sum of 37/20, 16/75, and 61/80 is 3391/1200.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the two fractions representing the portions of cake.

Given information:
- There were originally 60/20 portions of a cake.
- 16/75 portions of another cake were added.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of 20 and 75.
The LCD of 20 and 75 is 300.

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 300.
60/20 = (60 Ã— 15)/300 = 900/300
16/75 = (16 Ã— 4)/300 = 64/300

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the denominator as 300.
900/300 + 64/300 = (900 + 64)/300 = 964/300

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.
The GCF of 964 and 300 is 4.
964/300 = (964/4) / (300/4) = 241/75

Therefore, the total amount of cake after adding 16/75 portions to the original 60/20 portions is 241/75.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the summation of 83/40 and 6/8, we need to find a common denominator for both fractions.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 40 and 8 is 80.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 80:
83/40 = (83 Ã— 2)/80 = 166/80
6/8 = (6 Ã— 10)/80 = 60/80

Now we can add the fractions:
166/80 + 60/80 = (166 + 60)/80 = 226/80

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.

226/80 = (226/2)/(80/2) = 113/40

Therefore, the summation of 83/40 and 6/8 is 113/40.

            <span class="response-field">Claude-3 Sonnet:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the result of 83/40 + 6/8:
   Common denominator = 80
   83/40 = (83 Ã— 2)/80 = 166/80
   6/8 = (6 Ã— 10)/80 = 60/80
   166/80 + 60/80 = 226/80
   226/80 = (226/2)/(80/2) = 113/40

2. Now, we need to subtract 24/64 from 113/40:
   Common denominator = 640
   113/40 = (113 Ã— 16)/640 = 1808/640
   24/64 = (24 Ã— 10)/640 = 240/640
   1808/640 - 240/640 = 1568/640

3. To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 32.
   1568/640 = (1568/32)/(640/32) = 49/20

Therefore, after finding the result of 83/40 + 6/8 and then subtracting 24/64 from it, we get 49/20.

To find the sum of 83/18 and 6/8, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 8, which is 72.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 72:
83/18 = (83 Ã— 4)/72 = 332/72
6/8 = (6 Ã— 9)/72 = 54/72

Now we can add the fractions:
332/72 + 54/72 = (332 + 54)/72 = 386/72

To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.

386/72 = (386/2)/(72/2) = 193/36

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to perform the division operations and then subtract the resulting values.

Given:
- 97 / 56
- 31 / 52

Step 1: Divide 97 by 56.
97 / 56 = 1.732142857 (repeating decimal)

Step 2: Divide 31 by 52.
31 / 52 = 0.596153846 (repeating decimal)

Step 3: Subtract the second value from the first value.
1.732142857 - 0.596153846 = 1.135989011 (repeating decimal)

Step 4: Convert the repeating decimal to a fraction.
To convert a repeating decimal to a fraction, we can use the following steps:
a) Let x = 1.135989011...
b) Multiply both sides by 10^n, where n is the number of digits in the repeating block (in this case, n = 6).
10^6 x = 1135989.011...
c) Subtract the original equation from the new equation.
10^6 x - x = 1135989 - 1.135989011...
(10^6 - 1) x = 1135988
d) Divide both sides by (10^6 - 1) to find x.
x = 1135988 / (10^6 - 1)
x = 1135988 / 999999
x = 1135 / 999

Therefore, the value of 97 / 56 - 31 / 52 can be represented as the simplified fraction 1135 / 999.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 30 and 77 to get the common denominator.
LCM of 30 and 77 = 1770

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1770.
19/30 = (19 Ã— 59)/1770 = 1121/1770
75/77 = (75 Ã— 23)/1770 = 1725/1770

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(1121/1770) + (1725/1770) = (1121 + 1725)/1770 = 2846/1770

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator and dividing both by the GCF.
GCF of 2846 and 1770 = 2

Then, we can add the numerators and keep the LCD as the denominator.

Given fractions: 57/66 and 39/64

Step 1: Find the LCD of 66 and 64.
The LCD is the least common multiple of 66 and 64, which is 1056.

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
57/66 = (57 Ã— 16)/1056 = 912/1056
39/64 = (39 Ã— 16.5)/1056 = 643.5/1056

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the LCD as the denominator.
(912/1056) + (643.5/1056) = (912 + 643.5)/1056 = 1555.5/1056

First, we need to find the LCD of 1056 and 29.
The LCD is the least common multiple of 1056 and 29, which is 30624.

Next, we convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
1555.5/1056 = (1555.5 Ã— 29)/30624 = 45109.5/30624
10/29 = (10 Ã— 1056)/30624 = 10560/30624

Now, we can add the numerators and keep the LCD as the denominator.
(45109.5/30624) + (10560/30624) = (45109.5 + 10560)/30624 = 55669.5/30624

80/13 = (80 Ã— 48)/624 = 3840/624
2/48 = (2 Ã— 13)/624 = 26/624

Now we can add the fractions:

80/5 = (80 Ã— 48)/240 = 3840/240
2/48 = (2 Ã— 5)/240 = 10/240

Now we can add the fractions:
3840/240 + 10/240 = 3850/240

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 10.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the sum of two fractions, we need to find a common denominator and then add the numerators.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 21 and 86.
The LCM of 21 and 86 is 1806.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator 1806.
69/21 = (69 Ã— 86)/1806 = 5934/1806
71/86 = (71 Ã— 21)/1806 = 1491/1806

Step 3: Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
5934/1806 + 1491/1806 = 7425/1806

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction, if possible.
7425/1806 = (7425/1806) Ã— (1/1) = (7425/1) / (1806/1) = 7425/1806

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the sum of 69/21 and 71/86:
   LCM of 21 and 86 = 1806
   69/21 = (69 Ã— 86)/1806 = 5934/1806
   71/86 = (71 Ã— 21)/1806 = 1491/1806
   5934/1806 + 1491/1806 = 7425/1806

2. Now we need to add 86/62 to 7425/1806:
   LCM of 1806 and 62 = 112172
   7425/1806 = (7425 Ã— 62)/112172 = 461350/112172
   86/62 = (86 Ã— 1806)/112172 = 154716/112172
   461350/112172 + 154716/112172 = 616066/112172

3. Simplifying the resulting fraction:
   616066/112172 = (616066/112172) Ã— (1/1) = (616066/2) / (112172/2) = 308033/56086

Therefore, the result of adding the sum of 69/21 and 71/86 to 86/62 is 308033/56086.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 60 and 86.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator 1720.
69/60 = (69 Ã— 28.67)/1720 = 1977/1720 (where 28.67 = 1720/60)

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 60 and 45.
The LCM of 60 and 45 is 180.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 180.
24/60 = (24/60) Ã— (3/3) = 72/180
42/45 = (42/45) Ã— (4/4) = 168/180

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(72/180) + (168/180) = 240/180

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 240 and 180 is 60.
240/180 = (240/60) / (180/60) = 4/3

1. We know from the previous problem that the sum of 24/60 and 42/45 is 4/3.

2. Now we need to add 4/3 to 66/12.

3. To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD).
The LCD of 3 and 12 is 12.

4. Convert 4/3 to an equivalent fraction with the denominator of 12:
4/3 = (4/3) Ã— (4/4) = 16/12

5. Now we can add the fractions:
16/12 + 66/12 = 82/12

6. Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 82 and 12 is 2.
82/12 = (82/2) / (12/2) = 41/6

We need to find the sum of 24/60 and 42/67.

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 60 and 67.
The LCM of 60 and 67 is 1340.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 1340.
24/60 = (24/60) Ã— (22/22) = 528/1340
42/67 = (42/67) Ã— (20/20) = 840/1340

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(528/1340) + (840/1340) = 1368/1340

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF).
The GCF of 1368 and 1340 is 4.
1368/1340 = (1368/4) / (1340/4) = 342/335

64/76 = (64 Ã— 33)/2508 = 2112/2508
35/33 = (35 Ã— 76)/2508 = 2660/2508

Now we can add the fractions:
2112/2508 + 2660/2508 = 4772/2508

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 4.

4772/2508 = (4772/4)/(2508/4) = 1193/627

2. Now we need to add 47/38 to 1193/627
   * To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators
   * The LCM of 627 and 38 is 23826

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 2508.

43/76 = (43 Ã— 33)/2508 = 1419/2508
35/33 = (35 Ã— 76)/2508 = 2660/2508

Step 1: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 90 and 26.
The LCM of 90 and 26 is 90 Ã— 26 = 2340.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator of 2340.
26/90 = (26/90) Ã— (26/26) = 676/2340
50/26 = (50/26) Ã— (90/90) = 1700/2340

Step 3: Add the fractions with the common denominator.
(676/2340) + (1700/2340) = 2376/2340

Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible.
2376/2340 = 1188/1170

The least common multiple (LCM) of 98 and 82 is 8006.

So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 8006.

80/98 = (80 Ã— 81)/8006 = 6480/8006
92/82 = (92 Ã— 97)/8006 = 8924/8006

Now we can add the fractions:
6480/8006 + 8924/8006 = 15404/8006

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2.

15404/8006 = (15404/2)/(8006/2) = 7702/4003

89/44 = (89 Ã— 5)/220 = 445/220
69/5 = (69 Ã— 44)/220 = 3036/220

Now we can add the fractions:

1. First, we need to find the sum of 89/44 and 69/5:
   89/44 + 69/5 = (89 Ã— 5 + 69 Ã— 44) / (44 Ã— 5)

2. Now, we need to add this sum (3481/220) to itself:
   (3481/220) + (3481/220) = (3481 + 3481) / 220
   = 6962 / 220
   = 31.6454545...

To simplify the fraction:
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6962 and 220 is 2.
6962 / 2 = 3481
220 / 2 = 110

Now, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 532:
89/44 = (89 Ã— 12)/532 = 1068/532
69/38 = (69 Ã— 14)/532 = 966/532

Next, we add the fractions:
1068/532 + 966/532 = 2034/532

To simplify the fraction, we divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.

2034/532 = (2034/2)/(532/2) = 1017/266

Step 1: Find the usual length of the pieces.
Usual length = 45/2 feet
Usual length = 22.5 feet

Step 2: Subtract 18/90 feet from the usual length to find the length of the piece they sold.
Length of the piece sold = Usual length - 18/90 feet
Length of the piece sold = 22.5 feet - (18/90) feet
Length of the piece sold = 22.5 feet - 0.2 feet

Step 1: Find the standard length of the pieces.
Standard length = 45/2 feet

The LCM of 92 and 74 is 1036.

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator 1036.
99/92 = (99 Ã— 11)/1036
15/74 = (15 Ã— 14)/1036

Step 3: Add the fractions.
(99 Ã— 11)/1036 + (15 Ã— 14)/1036 = (1089 + 210)/1036 = 1299/1036

Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
The GCD of 1299 and 1036 is 7.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate 54/1 + 62/30, we first need to find the common denominator for the fractions.

The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which in this case is 30.

So, we need to convert 54/1 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 30.
54/1 = 54/1 * 30/30 = 1620/30

Now we can add the fractions:
1620/30 + 62/30 = (1620 + 62)/30 = 1682/30

To express the answer in simplest terms, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator and divide both by that number.

The GCF of 1682 and 30 is 2.
1682/2 = 841
30/2 = 15

Therefore, the simplest form of the answer is 841/15.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the result of 54/1 + 62/30 (as we did in the previous question):
   54/1 + 62/30 = 1620/30 + 62/30 = 1682/30 = 841/15

2. Now, we need to subtract 53/41 from 841/15.
   To do this, we need to find a common denominator for 841/15 and 53/41.
   The least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and 41 is 615.

3. Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with a denominator of 615:
   841/15 = 841/15 * 41/41 = 34481/615
   53/41 = 53/41 * 15/15 = 795/615

4. Subtract the fractions:
   34481/615 - 795/615 = 33686/615

5. Express the result in simplest terms by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by that number.
   The GCF of 33686 and 615 is 1.
   Therefore, the simplest form is 33686/615.

3) Now we add 62/30 to 2790/30
   2790/30 + 62/30 = (2790 + 62)/30 = 2852/30
4) To express the answer in simplest terms, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator and divide both by that number.
5) The GCF of 2852 and 30 is 2.

Given fractions: 85/29 and 47/7

Step 1: Find the LCD of 29 and 7.
LCD = 29 Ã— 7 = 203

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
85/29 = (85 Ã— 7)/203
47/7 = (47 Ã— 29)/203

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.
(85 Ã— 7)/203 + (47 Ã— 29)/203 = (595 + 1363)/203 = 1958/203

Now, we convert all fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
1958/203 = (1958 Ã— 42)/8526
81/42 = (81 Ã— 203)/8526

Given:
- Weight of oranges = 85/64 pounds
- Weight of apples = 47/7 pounds

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of 64 and 7.
LCD = 64 Ã— 7 = 448

Step 2: Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
85/64 = (85 Ã— 7)/448
47/7 = (47 Ã— 64)/448

Step 3: Add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.
(85 Ã— 7)/448 + (47 Ã— 64)/448 = (595 + 3008)/448 = 3603/448

Step 4: Convert the resulting fraction to a mixed number (if possible).
