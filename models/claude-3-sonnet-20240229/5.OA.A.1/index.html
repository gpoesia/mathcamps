        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of packs required to package the remaining socks, and then add it to the existing number of packs. After that, we need to add the new shipment and subtract the returned packs.

Given information:
- The company packages socks in sets of 40.
- They have 2840 socks to package.
- They currently have 93 packs already made.
- They received an additional shipment of 70 packs.
- They had to return 8 packs due to quality issues.

Step 1: Find the number of socks remaining to be packaged.
Total socks - Socks already packaged = Remaining socks
2840 - (93 Ã— 40) = 2840 - 3720 = -880 socks
Since the result is negative, it means all the socks have been packaged.

Step 2: Find the total number of packs after packaging all the socks.
Total packs = Existing packs
Total packs = 93 packs

Step 3: Find the total number of packs after receiving the new shipment.
Total packs = Existing packs + New shipment
Total packs = 93 + 70 = 163 packs

Step 4: Find the total number of packs after returning the defective packs.
Total packs = Total packs after new shipment - Returned packs
Total packs = 163 - 8 = 155 packs

Therefore, the company has 155 packs of socks now.

Given information:
- The gardener planted 80 rose bushes.
- Each bush produces 30 roses.
- A storm blew away 43 roses.

Step 1: Find the total number of roses in the field before the storm.
Total number of roses = Number of rose bushes Ã— Number of roses per bush
Total number of roses = 80 Ã— 30 = 2,400 roses

Step 2: Find the number of roses remaining after the storm.
Number of roses remaining = Total number of roses - Number of roses blown away
Number of roses remaining = 2,400 - 43 = 2,357 roses

Therefore, there are 2,357 roses remaining in the field after the storm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to recalculate the total number of roses in the field with the corrected number of rose bushes and then subtract the number of roses blown away by the storm.

Given information:
- The gardener actually planted 84 rose bushes (corrected from 80).
- Each bush produces 30 roses.
- A storm blew away 43 roses.

Step 1: Find the total number of roses in the field before the storm with the corrected number of rose bushes.
Total number of roses = Number of rose bushes Ã— Number of roses per bush
Total number of roses = 84 Ã— 30 = 2,520 roses

Step 2: Find the number of roses remaining after the storm.
Number of roses remaining = Total number of roses - Number of roses blown away
Number of roses remaining = 2,520 - 43 = 2,477 roses

Therefore, with the corrected number of rose bushes, the gardener actually has 2,477 roses remaining in the field after the storm.

Given information:
- A dolphin can leap (3 + 59) feet high.
- A dolphin completes 89 jumps in a day.

Step 1: Find the height of each jump.
Height of each jump = 3 + 59 = 62 feet

Step 2: Calculate the total distance jumped by multiplying the height of each jump by the number of jumps.
Total distance jumped = Height of each jump Ã— Number of jumps
Total distance jumped = 62 feet Ã— 89 jumps
Total distance jumped = 5,518 feet

Therefore, the dolphin has jumped a total of 5,518 feet in that day.

Given information:
- The dolphin can leap (41 + 59) feet high, which is 100 feet.
- The dolphin completes 89 jumps in a day.

Step 1: Find the height of each jump.
Height of each jump = 41 + 59 = 100 feet

Step 2: Calculate the total distance jumped by multiplying the height of each jump by the number of jumps.
Total distance jumped = Height of each jump Ã— Number of jumps
Total distance jumped = 100 feet Ã— 89 jumps
Total distance jumped = 8,900 feet

Therefore, with the corrected height of each jump, the dolphin has jumped a total of 8,900 feet in that day.

- The store sells 61 candies throughout the day.

Step 1: Find the total number of candies after receiving the delivery.
Total candies after delivery = Starting candies + Candies received in delivery
Total candies after delivery = 81 + 6 = 87 candies

Step 2: Find the number of candies left after selling 61 candies.
Candies left = Total candies after delivery - Candies sold
Candies left = 87 - 61 = 26 candies

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate the total number of pens produced with the updated information.

Given information:
- Each batch contains 39 pens.
- The company has produced 43 batches.

Step 1: Find the number of pens in one batch.
Number of pens in one batch = 39 pens

Step 2: Find the total number of pens produced by multiplying the number of pens in one batch by the number of batches produced.
Total number of pens produced = Number of pens in one batch Ã— Number of batches produced
Total number of pens produced = 39 pens Ã— 43 batches
Total number of pens produced = 1,677 pens

Therefore, with the updated information, the company actually produced 1,677 pens.

Given information:
- The dairy farm has 33 cows.
- Each cow gives (99 + 58) litres of milk per day.

Step 1: Find how much milk one cow produces in a day.
Milk produced by one cow per day = 99 + 58 litres
Milk produced by one cow per day = 157 litres

Step 2: Find the total milk produced by all cows in a day.
Total milk produced by all cows in a day = Milk produced by one cow per day Ã— Number of cows
Total milk produced by all cows in a day = 157 litres Ã— 33 cows
Total milk produced by all cows in a day = 5,181 litres

Step 1: Find the total number of grapes produced by all the vines.
Total number of grapes = Number of grapes produced by one vine Ã— Number of vines
Total number of grapes = 3344 Ã— 38
Total number of grapes = 127,072 grapes

Step 2: Find the number of grapes produced by each vine.
Number of grapes produced by each vine = Total number of grapes / Number of vines
Number of grapes produced by each vine = 127,072 / 38

- Today, the region received an additional 29 cm of snow.
- 20 cm of snow has melted.

Step 1: Find the total amount of snow that fell.
Total snow that fell = Yesterday's snowfall + Today's snowfall
Total snow that fell = 93 cm + 29 cm
Total snow that fell = 122 cm

Step 2: Subtract the amount of snow that melted from the total snow that fell.
Snow left = Total snow that fell - Snow melted
Snow left = 122 cm - 20 cm
Snow left = 102 cm

- Today, the region received an additional 90 cm of snow (instead of 29 cm).
- 20 cm of snow has melted.

Step 1: Find the total amount of snow that fell.
Total snow that fell = Yesterday's snowfall + Today's snowfall
Total snow that fell = 93 cm + 90 cm
Total snow that fell = 183 cm

Step 2: Subtract the amount of snow that melted from the total snow that fell.
Snow left = Total snow that fell - Snow melted
Snow left = 183 cm - 20 cm
Snow left = 163 cm

Therefore, with the heavier snowfall of 90 cm today, instead of 29 cm, and the same 20 cm melt, the amount of snow now left in the region is 163 cm.

- The farmer gives away 50 bags of grapes.

Step 1: Find the total number of bags the farmer had initially.
Total number of grapes / Number of grapes per bag = Total number of bags
3069 grapes / 33 grapes per bag = 93 bags

Step 2: Find the number of bags remaining after eating and giving away bags.
Total number of bags - Number of bags eaten - Number of bags given away = Number of bags remaining

Given information:

- Each bag contains 25 grapes.
- The farmer eats 13 bags of grapes.
- The farmer gives away 50 bags of grapes.

Step 1: Find the total number of bags the farmer can make with 3069 grapes when each bag contains 25 grapes.
Total number of grapes / Number of grapes per bag = Total number of bags
3069 grapes / 25 grapes per bag = 122.76 bags
Since we cannot have a fractional number of bags, we round down to 122 bags.

Step 2: Find the number of bags remaining after eating and giving away bags.
Total number of bags - Number of bags eaten - Number of bags given away = Number of bags remaining
122 bags - 13 bags - 50 bags = 59 bags

Step 2: Find the total number of leaves the giraffe needs for a single day.
Total number of leaves needed for a single day = Number of leaves needed for breakfast + Number of leaves needed in the afternoon
Total number of leaves needed for a single day = 67 + 33
Total number of leaves needed for a single day = 100 leaves

Therefore, the giraffe needs 100 leaves for a single day.

* You can drive 304 miles on a full tank of gas
* The tank is divided into 4 equal parts
* You can drive a certain distance on one part of the tank
* If you refill this part of the tank 47 times

To find the distance you can drive on one part of the tank:

Distance traveled in 1 day = Speed of the river
Distance traveled in 1 day = 96 miles

Step 2: Find the distance traveled in 31 days.
Distance traveled in 31 days = Distance traveled in 1 day Ã— Number of days
Distance traveled in 31 days = 96 miles Ã— 31 days

Given information:
- The river traveled 2,976 miles in 31 days.
- The piece of debris got an additional 94 miles downstream due to the wind in those 31 days.

To find the total distance traveled by the piece of debris, we need to add the distance traveled by the river and the additional distance due to the wind.

Step 1: Find the distance traveled by the piece of debris due to the river flow.
Distance traveled by the piece of debris due to the river flow = Distance traveled by the river
Distance traveled by the piece of debris due to the river flow = 2,976 miles

Step 2: Find the total distance traveled by the piece of debris.
Total distance traveled by the piece of debris = Distance traveled due to the river flow + Additional distance due to the wind
Total distance traveled by the piece of debris = 2,976 miles + 94 miles
Total distance traveled by the piece of debris = 3,070 miles

Therefore, the piece of debris would have traveled a total of 3,070 miles in those 31 days.

Step 1: Find the distance traveled in 1 day.
Distance traveled in 1 day = Speed of the river
Distance traveled in 1 day = 12 miles

Step 2: Find the distance traveled in 31 days.
Distance traveled in 31 days = Distance traveled in 1 day Ã— Number of days
Distance traveled in 31 days = 12 miles Ã— 31 days
Distance traveled in 31 days = 372 miles

Therefore, with the slower speed of 12 miles per day, the river would have traveled 372 miles in 31 days.

Step 1: Find the total number of blankets produced by the manufacturer in 43 days.
Number of blankets produced per day Ã— Number of days = Total blankets produced
46 blankets Ã— 43 days = 1,978 blankets

Step 2: Add the donated blankets to the total blankets produced.
Total blankets produced + Donated blankets = Total blankets

Step 1: Find the total number of lemons produced in 51 years.
Total lemons produced in 51 years = Number of lemons produced per year Ã— Number of years
Total lemons produced in 51 years = 99 Ã— 51
Total lemons produced in 51 years = 5,049 lemons

Step 2: Subtract the number of lemons removed by the wind storm from the total lemons produced.
Lemons remaining after the wind storm = Total lemons produced in 51 years - Lemons removed by the wind storm
Lemons remaining after the wind storm = 5,049 - 84
Lemons remaining after the wind storm = 4,965 lemons

Therefore, after the wind storm, the lemon tree produced 4,965 lemons.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of lemons the tree produced in 40 years and then subtract the number of lemons removed by the wind storm.

Given information:
- The lemon tree produces 99 lemons every year.
- The wind storm occurred after 40 years.
- The wind storm removed 84 lemons from the total number of lemons produced.

Step 1: Find the total number of lemons produced in 40 years.
Total lemons produced in 40 years = Number of lemons produced per year Ã— Number of years
Total lemons produced in 40 years = 99 Ã— 40
Total lemons produced in 40 years = 3,960 lemons

Step 2: Subtract the number of lemons removed by the wind storm from the total lemons produced.
Lemons remaining after the wind storm = Total lemons produced in 40 years - Lemons removed by the wind storm
Lemons remaining after the wind storm = 3,960 - 84
Lemons remaining after the wind storm = 3,876 lemons

Therefore, after the wind storm that occurred after 40 years, the lemon tree produced 3,876 lemons.

Given information:
- John had 4 packs of building blocks.
- Each pack contains 89 blocks.
- John lost 72 blocks while playing.

Step 1: Find the total number of blocks John had initially.
Total number of blocks = Number of packs Ã— Number of blocks per pack
Total number of blocks = 4 Ã— 89 = 356 blocks

Step 2: Subtract the number of blocks John lost from the initial total.
Number of blocks remaining = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks lost
Number of blocks remaining = 356 - 72 = 284 blocks

- John had 4 packs of building blocks.
- Each pack contains 41 blocks.
- John lost 72 blocks while playing.

Step 1: Find the total number of blocks John had initially.
Total number of blocks = Number of packs Ã— Number of blocks per pack
Total number of blocks = 4 Ã— 41 = 164 blocks

Step 2: Subtract the number of blocks John lost from the initial total.
Number of blocks remaining = Total number of blocks - Number of blocks lost
Number of blocks remaining = 164 - 72 = 92 blocks

Therefore, with each pack containing 41 blocks and after losing 72 blocks, John has 92 blocks remaining.

Average number of seashells per meter = Total number of seashells / Total number of meters
Average number of seashells per meter = 5544 / 72
Average number of seashells per meter = 77

- There are 5544 seashells on the beach.
- The seashells are evenly distributed across 92 meters of sand.

To find the average number of seashells per meter, we need to divide the total number of seashells by the total number of meters.

Average number of seashells per meter = Total number of seashells / Total number of meters
Average number of seashells per meter = 5544 / 92
Average number of seashells per meter = 60.26086956521739

Since we cannot have a fractional part of a seashell, we need to round down the answer to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, with the revised count, on average, there are 60 seashells for every meter of the beach.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of episodes aired across all four seasons.

Given information:
- The 1st season had 66 episodes.
- The 2nd season had 67 episodes.
- The 3rd season had 8 + 80 = 88 episodes.
- The 4th season had 82 episodes.

Step 1: Find the total number of episodes aired in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd seasons.
Total episodes in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd seasons = 66 + 67 + 88 = 221 episodes

Step 2: Add the number of episodes aired in the 4th season.
Total episodes aired = Total episodes in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd seasons + Episodes aired in 4th season
Total episodes aired = 221 + 82 = 303 episodes

Therefore, a total of 303 episodes have aired in total across all four seasons.

Given information:
- The 1st season had 66 episodes.
- The 2nd season had 8 episodes.
- 8 episodes of the 3rd season have been aired.

Step 1: Find the total number of episodes aired in the 1st and 2nd seasons.
Total episodes in 1st and 2nd seasons = 66 + 8 = 74 episodes

Step 2: Add the number of episodes aired in the 3rd season.
Total episodes aired = Total episodes in 1st and 2nd seasons + Episodes aired in 3rd season
Total episodes aired = 74 + 8 = 82 episodes

Therefore, with the updated information, a total of 82 episodes have aired so far across all three seasons.

Given information:
- The leprechaun adds 39 gold coins to the pot.
- The leprechaun adds another 47 gold coins to the pot.
- A fairy takes away 8 gold coins from the pot.
- The new total of coins becomes a code.
- The code must be enhanced by adding 48 to it only once.
- The enhanced code must be multiplied by 24.

Step 1: Find the total number of gold coins in the pot after the leprechaun adds coins and the fairy takes away coins.
Total coins added by the leprechaun = 39 + 47 = 86
Total coins after the fairy takes away 8 coins = 86 - 8 = 78

Step 2: Enhance the code by adding 48 to it.
Enhanced code = 78 + 48 = 126

Step 3: Multiply the enhanced code by 24.
Final value to unlock the magical lock = 126 Ã— 24 = 3,024

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the initial value of the code (the total number of gold coins in the pot after the leprechaun adds coins and the fairy takes away coins) and then multiply it by 29 after adding 48.

Given information:
- The leprechaun adds 39 gold coins to the pot.
- The leprechaun adds another 47 gold coins to the pot.
- A fairy takes away 8 gold coins from the pot.
- The new total of coins becomes the initial code.
- The initial code must be enhanced by adding 48 to it only once.
- The enhanced code must be multiplied by 29.
- The final value to unlock the magical lock is 3,024.

Step 1: Find the total number of gold coins in the pot after the leprechaun adds coins and the fairy takes away coins.
Total coins added by the leprechaun = 39 + 47 = 86
Total coins after the fairy takes away 8 coins = 86 - 8 = 78

Step 2: Set up an equation to find the initial code.
Let the initial code be x.
Enhanced code = x + 48
Final value to unlock the magical lock = (x + 48) Ã— 29 = 3,024

Substituting the final value, we get:
(x + 48) Ã— 29 = 3,024
x + 48 = 3,024 / 29
x + 48 = 104
x = 104 - 48
x = 56

Therefore, the initial value of the code (the total number of gold coins in the pot) should be 56 to unlock the magical lock correctly.

- John initially had $98 in his wallet.
- He found a $35 bill on the ground and added it to his wallet.
- He spent $68 on lunch instead of $38.

To calculate the amount of money left in his wallet, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the total amount of money John had after finding the $35 bill:
   Initial amount + Found money = Total amount
   $98 + $35 = $133

2. Subtract the amount he spent on lunch ($68) from the total amount ($133):
   Total amount - Amount spent on lunch = Amount left
   $133 - $68 = $65

Therefore, after finding the $35 bill and spending $68 on lunch, John has $65 left in his wallet.

- The frog hops an average of 6 inches per single leap.

Step 1: Find the number of leaps required to cover the total distance.
Number of leaps = Total distance / Distance covered per leap
Number of leaps = 83 inches / 6 inches per leap
Number of leaps = 13.83 leaps

Since we cannot have a fractional number of leaps, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Number of leaps = 14 leaps

Therefore, it takes the frog 14 leaps to complete the new journey, covering a total distance of 83 inches.

Given information:
- The cheese factory produces 5865 kg of cheese in total.
- The cheese is produced evenly over 85 days.

Step 1: Divide the total amount of cheese produced by the number of days.
Amount of cheese produced per day = Total amount of cheese produced / Number of days
Amount of cheese produced per day = 5865 kg / 85 days

Step 2: Calculate the amount of cheese produced per day.

Given information:
- The cheese factory produces a total of 5865 kg of cheese.
- The factory now operates for 31 days a month.

To find the amount of cheese produced each day, we need to divide the total amount of cheese produced by the number of days the factory operates in a month.

Step 1: Divide the total amount of cheese produced by the number of days in a month.
Amount of cheese produced per day = Total amount of cheese produced / Number of days in a month
Amount of cheese produced per day = 5865 kg / 31 days

Step 2: Calculate the amount of cheese produced per day.
Amount of cheese produced per day = 5865 kg / 31 days
Amount of cheese produced per day = 189.19 kg

Therefore, with the factory operating for 31 days a month and producing a total of 5865 kg of cheese, the amount of cheese produced each day would be 189.19 kg.

- A section of the farm grows 38 plants.
- 74 cucumbers were damaged.

Step 1: Find the number of cucumbers produced by 54 plants.
Number of cucumbers produced by 54 plants = 2592

Step 2: Find the number of cucumbers produced by 1 plant.
Number of cucumbers produced by 1 plant = 2592 / 54 = 48

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the battery life when the lights are on and then calculate the total battery life based on the number of hours the toy car is run with the lights on.

Given information:
- The toy car battery lasts 16 hours without the lights on.
- When the lights are on, the battery life decreases by (36 Ã· 9) = 4 hours.
- The toy car is run with the lights on for 12 full weeks.
- Each week is considered to be 60 hours.

Step 1: Find the battery life when the lights are on.
Battery life with lights on = Battery life without lights - Decrease in battery life due to lights
Battery life with lights on = 16 hours - 4 hours = 12 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours the toy car is run with the lights on.
Total hours with lights on = Number of weeks Ã— Hours per week
Total hours with lights on = 12 weeks Ã— 60 hours/week = 720 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total battery life by dividing the total hours with lights on by the battery life with lights on.
Total battery life = Total hours with lights on / Battery life with lights on
Total battery life = 720 hours / 12 hours = 60 batteries

Therefore, the battery lasted for 60 batteries when the toy car was run with the lights on for 12 full weeks.

Cost of each installment = Total cost / Number of installments
Cost of each installment = $2407 / 83

* The cost of the leather wallet was $2407
* It could be paid in 83 installments
* So each installment was $2407 / 83 = $29
* Now, you want to buy a simple keychain that costs the same as a single installment of the wallet purchase
* But the question states that each installment was $83 divided by 83

Dividing $83 by 83 gives us:
$83 / 83 = $1

So if each installment for the wallet was $1, then the cost of the simple keychain is also $1.

- The summer period is now 50 days instead of 58 days.

To find the daily average amount of salmon eaten by the bear over a 50-day period, we need to divide the total amount of salmon eaten by the number of days.

Step 1: Find the total amount of salmon eaten.
Total amount of salmon eaten = 2726 ounces

Step 2: Find the number of days in the new summer period.
Number of days = 50 days

Step 3: Calculate the daily average amount of salmon eaten.
Daily average amount of salmon eaten = Total amount of salmon eaten / Number of days
Daily average amount of salmon eaten = 2726 ounces / 50 days
Daily average amount of salmon eaten = 54.52 ounces

Therefore, if the bear had eaten the same total amount of salmon (2726 ounces) but over a shorter 50-day period instead of 58 days, the daily average amount of salmon eaten by the bear would be 54.52 ounces.

Total carrots yielded = Carrots from patch 1 + Carrots from patch 2
Total carrots yielded = 26 + 16 = 42 carrots

Step 2: Find the total number of carrots collected in 22 days.

Given information:
- The chef uses 483g of sugar to make 7 cakes.

Step 1: Find the amount of sugar used for one cake.
Amount of sugar used for one cake = Total amount of sugar used / Number of cakes
Amount of sugar used for one cake = 483g / 7
Amount of sugar used for one cake = 69g

Therefore, the chef uses 69g of sugar for each cake.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this problem, we need to find out how much sugar the chef uses for each cake after adding an extra 25g of sugar to the recipe.

Given:
- The original amount of sugar used for each cake was 69g.
- The chef added an extra 25g of sugar to the recipe.

To calculate the new amount of sugar used for each cake, we need to add the extra 25g to the original amount.

Step 1: Calculate the new amount of sugar used for each cake.
New amount of sugar used for each cake = Original amount of sugar + Extra sugar added
New amount of sugar used for each cake = 69g + 25g
New amount of sugar used for each cake = 94g

Therefore, the chef now uses 94g of sugar for each cake in the new batch.

Given information:
- The kite maker has 41 blue kites, 63 red kites, and 57 green kites.
- The kite maker gave away 98 kites.
- The kite maker created an additional 3 kites.

Step 1: Find the total number of kites the kite maker had initially.
Total number of kites initially = 41 (blue) + 63 (red) + 57 (green)
Total number of kites initially = 161 kites

Step 2: Subtract the number of kites given away.
Number of kites remaining after giving away = Total number of kites initially - Number of kites given away
Number of kites remaining after giving away = 161 - 98 = 63 kites

Step 3: Add the number of new kites created.
Number of kites after creating new ones = Number of kites remaining after giving away + Number of new kites created
Number of kites after creating new ones = 63 + 3 = 66 kites

Therefore, the kite maker now has 66 kites.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the current inventory of the kite maker after giving away 98 kites and creating 3 new kites, then multiply it by 18 to get the increased production, and finally add the original inventory to the increased production.

Given information:
- The kite maker originally had 41 blue kites, 63 red kites, and 57 green kites.
- The kite maker gave away 98 kites.
- The kite maker created an additional 3 kites.
- The kite maker wants to multiply their current inventory by 18 and add the original inventory to this increased production.

Step 1: Find the current inventory after giving away 98 kites and creating 3 new kites.
Current inventory = Original inventory - Kites given away + New kites created
Current inventory = (41 + 63 + 57) - 98 + 3 = 161 - 98 + 3 = 66 kites

Step 2: Multiply the current inventory by 18 to get the increased production.
Increased production = Current inventory Ã— 18
Increased production = 66 Ã— 18 = 1,188 kites

Step 3: Add the original inventory to the increased production.
Total kites after increased production = Original inventory + Increased production
Total kites after increased production = (41 + 63 + 57) + 1,188 = 161 + 1,188 = 1,349 kites

Therefore, after ramping up production and multiplying their current inventory by 18, and adding the original inventory to this increased production, the kite maker would have 1,349 kites.

            After the kite maker gave away some kites and made new ones, let's change the circumstances a bit. Instead of giving away 98 kites, they only gave away 19 kites. Taking into account that they still made an additional 3 kites, how many kites does the maker have now?

Given information:
- The kite maker initially had 41 blue kites, 63 red kites, and 57 green kites.
- The kite maker gave away 19 kites (instead of 98).
- The kite maker created an additional 3 kites.

Step 1: Find the total number of kites the kite maker had initially.
Total number of kites initially = 41 (blue) + 63 (red) + 57 (green)
Total number of kites initially = 161 kites

Step 2: Subtract the number of kites given away (19 instead of 98).
Number of kites remaining after giving away = Total number of kites initially - Number of kites given away
Number of kites remaining after giving away = 161 - 19 = 142 kites

Step 3: Add the number of new kites created (3 kites).
Number of kites after creating new ones = Number of kites remaining after giving away + Number of new kites created
Number of kites after creating new ones = 142 + 3 = 145 kites

Therefore, with the new information that the kite maker gave away 19 kites instead of 98, and still created an additional 3 kites, the kite maker now has 145 kites.

- Reduced speed of the train = 28 mph
- Total travel time = 21 hours

Step 1: Calculate the distance the train would have traveled at the original speed of 68 mph.
Distance = Speed Ã— Time
Distance = 68 mph Ã— 21 hours
Distance = 1,428 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance the train would have traveled at the reduced speed of 28 mph.
Distance = Speed Ã— Time
Distance = 28 mph Ã— 21 hours
Distance = 588 miles

Step 3: Calculate the impact on the total distance traveled by finding the difference between the two distances.
Impact on the total distance traveled = Distance at original speed - Distance at reduced speed
Impact on the total distance traveled = 1,428 miles - 588 miles
Impact on the total distance traveled = 840 miles

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to subtract the amount of health lost from the initial health value.

Given information:
- The character starts with a health value of 82.
- The character's health value decreases by 69 after being attacked.

Step 1: Subtract the amount of health lost from the initial health value.
Initial health value - Health lost = Remaining health value
82 - 69 = 13

Therefore, the character's remaining health value is 13.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's consider the new scenario where the character starts with a health value of 82 and loses 33 health points after being attacked by a weaker rival character.

Given information:
- The character starts with a health value of 82.
- The character loses 33 health points after being attacked.

To find the remaining health value, we need to subtract the health points lost from the initial health value.

Step 1: Subtract the health points lost from the initial health value.
Initial health value - Health points lost = Remaining health value
82 - 33 = 49

Therefore, in this new scenario, the character's remaining health value after losing 33 health points is 49.

Given information:
- The designer creates 77 dresses in a week.
- Each dress is sold for $16.
- The cost of fabric damage is $27.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the dresses.
Total revenue = Number of dresses Ã— Price per dress
Total revenue = 77 Ã— $16 = $1,232

Step 2: Subtract the cost of fabric damage from the total revenue.
Net earnings = Total revenue - Cost of fabric damage

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how much additional distance the snail can travel per day with the energy extracted from the lettuce leaves.

Given information:
- The snail travels 66 inches in a day without additional energy.
- The snail extracted energy from 704 lettuce leaves over 22 days.
- The energy from the lettuce leaves allows the snail to move an additional inch per day.

Step 1: Find the number of lettuce leaves the snail extracted energy from per day.
Number of lettuce leaves per day = Total number of lettuce leaves / Number of days
Number of lettuce leaves per day = 704 lettuce leaves / 22 days
Number of lettuce leaves per day = 32 lettuce leaves per day

Step 2: Find the additional distance the snail can travel per day with the energy from the lettuce leaves.
Additional distance per day = 1 inch per day (given)

Step 3: Find the total distance the snail can travel in a day with the additional energy.
Total distance per day = Distance without additional energy + Additional distance with energy
Total distance per day = 66 inches + 1 inch
Total distance per day = 67 inches

Therefore, with the additional energy from the lettuce leaves, the snail can travel 67 inches in a day.

Given information:
- One cake requires 65 grams of sugar.
- The bakery prepares 29 cakes.
- The bakery adds 46 grams of sugar for frosting.

Step 1: Find the total amount of sugar required for the 29 cakes.
Amount of sugar required for one cake Ã— Number of cakes = Total amount of sugar required for the cakes
65 grams Ã— 29 cakes = 1,885 grams

Step 2: Find the total amount of sugar required by adding the amount of sugar for frosting.
Total amount of sugar required for the cakes + Amount of sugar for frosting = Total amount of sugar required

Given information:
- The skateboard company makes a total of 128 skateboards in a day.

- The skateboard company had to discard 65 skateboards due to quality issues.

Step 1: Find the total number of skateboards made in 21 days.
Total number of skateboards made in 21 days = Number of skateboards made per day Ã— Number of days
Total number of skateboards made in 21 days = 128 Ã— 21
Total number of skateboards made in 21 days = 2,688

Step 2: Subtract the number of skateboards discarded due to quality issues.
Number of skateboards made after discarding faulty ones = Total number of skateboards made in 21 days - Number of skateboards discarded
Number of skateboards made after discarding faulty ones = 2,688 - 65
Number of skateboards made after discarding faulty ones = 2,623

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of bananas the monkey gets per month, which is given by the expression ((360 bananas / 12 months) + 16 extra bananas).

Given information:
- The monkey gets 360 bananas per year.
- The year is divided into 12 months.
- The monkey gets 16 extra bananas per month.

Step 1: Find the number of bananas the monkey gets per month from the yearly supply.
Number of bananas per month from the yearly supply = 360 bananas / 12 months
Number of bananas per month from the yearly supply = 30 bananas

Step 2: Add the extra 16 bananas to the number of bananas per month from the yearly supply.
Total number of bananas per month = Number of bananas per month from the yearly supply + Extra bananas per month
Total number of bananas per month = 30 bananas + 16 bananas
Total number of bananas per month = 46 bananas

Therefore, the monkey gets 46 bananas per month.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of bananas the monkey received in the next month, and then subtract the number of bananas that were stolen.

Given information:
- The monkey gets 360 bananas per year.
- The year is divided into 12 months.
- The monkey gets 16 extra bananas per month.
- The monkey received 79 more bananas in the next month.
- 67 bananas were stolen.

Step 1: Find the number of bananas the monkey gets per month from the yearly supply.
Number of bananas per month from the yearly supply = 360 bananas / 12 months
Number of bananas per month from the yearly supply = 30 bananas

Step 2: Find the total number of bananas the monkey received in the next month.
Total number of bananas received = Number of bananas per month from the yearly supply + Extra bananas per month + Additional bananas
Total number of bananas received = 30 bananas + 16 bananas + 79 bananas
Total number of bananas received = 125 bananas

Step 3: Subtract the number of bananas that were stolen from the total number of bananas received.
Number of bananas remaining = Total number of bananas received - Number of bananas stolen
Number of bananas remaining = 125 bananas - 67 bananas
Number of bananas remaining = 58 bananas

Therefore, the monkey has 58 bananas now.

Given information:
- The monkey gets 360 bananas every 20 months.
- The monkey gets 16 extra bananas per month.

Step 1: Find the number of bananas the monkey gets per month from the supply of 360 bananas every 20 months.
Number of bananas per month from the supply = 360 bananas / 20 months
Number of bananas per month from the supply = 18 bananas

Step 2: Add the extra 16 bananas to the number of bananas per month from the supply.
Total number of bananas per month = Number of bananas per month from the supply + Extra bananas per month
Total number of bananas per month = 18 bananas + 16 bananas
Total number of bananas per month = 34 bananas

Therefore, if the monkey gets 360 bananas every 20 months and also gets 16 extra bananas per month, the monkey would get 34 bananas per month.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of degrees in a circle (360Â°) by the number of arms of the starfish (5).

Given information:
- A starfish has 5 arms.
- There are 360 degrees in a circle.

Step 1: Divide the total number of degrees in a circle by the number of arms of the starfish.
Number of degrees in each section = Total degrees in a circle / Number of arms
Number of degrees in each section = 360Â° / 5
Number of degrees in each section = 72Â°

Therefore, if the circle were to be equally divided among the starfish's arms, each section would have 72 degrees.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem.

Given information:
- The starfish has 17 arms.
- There are 360 degrees in a circle.

To find the number of degrees in each section, we need to divide the total number of degrees in a circle by the number of arms of the starfish.

Step 1: Divide the total number of degrees in a circle by the number of arms of the starfish.
Number of degrees in each section = Total degrees in a circle / Number of arms
Number of degrees in each section = 360Â° / 17
Number of degrees in each section = 21.176...Â°

Since we cannot have a fractional degree, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of degrees in each section = 21Â°

Therefore, if the circle were to be equally divided among the starfish's 17 arms, each section would have 21 degrees.

Given information:
- The toy store initially has 26 stuffed rabbits.
- They order an additional 84 stuffed rabbits.
- They order 36 stuffed bears.

Step 1: Find the total number of stuffed rabbits after the new order.
Total number of stuffed rabbits = Initial number of stuffed rabbits + Additional stuffed rabbits ordered
Total number of stuffed rabbits = 26 + 84 = 110 stuffed rabbits

Step 2: Find the total number of stuffed animals by adding the number of stuffed rabbits and stuffed bears.
Total number of stuffed animals = Total number of stuffed rabbits + Number of stuffed bears
Total number of stuffed animals = 110 + 36 = 146 stuffed animals

- They received a special order of 1 rare stuffed panda.

Step 1: Find the total number of stuffed animals after adding the rare stuffed panda.
Total number of stuffed animals = Total number of stuffed animals after the initial order + Number of rare stuffed pandas
Total number of stuffed animals = 146 + 1 = 147 stuffed animals

- Rachel decided to reduce her Wednesday screen time by the amount she had watched on Monday (35 minutes).

Step 1: Find the reduced screen time for Wednesday.
Initial screen time on Wednesday = 68 minutes
Reduction in screen time = 35 minutes (amount watched on Monday)
Reduced screen time on Wednesday = 68 minutes - 35 minutes = 33 minutes

Step 2: Find the total number of minutes Rachel watched TV on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday after reducing her Wednesday screen time.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of fish and squid required for 59 days.

Given information:
- A dolphin needs 96 kilograms of fish per day.
- A dolphin needs 22 kilograms of squid per day.
- The dolphin's diet remained unchanged for 59 days.

Step 1: Find the total amount of fish required for 59 days.
Total amount of fish required = Amount of fish required per day Ã— Number of days
Total amount of fish required = 96 kilograms Ã— 59 days
Total amount of fish required = 5,664 kilograms

Step 2: Find the total amount of squid required for 59 days.
Total amount of squid required = Amount of squid required per day Ã— Number of days
Total amount of squid required = 22 kilograms Ã— 59 days
Total amount of squid required = 1,298 kilograms

Step 3: Find the total amount of fish and squid required for 59 days.
Total amount of fish and squid required = Total amount of fish required + Total amount of squid required
Total amount of fish and squid required = 5,664 kilograms + 1,298 kilograms
Total amount of fish and squid required = 6,962 kilograms

Therefore, the dolphin would need a total of 6,962 kilograms of fish and squid to maintain its diet for 59 days.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of fish and squid required for 59 days with the new diet.

Given information:
- A dolphin needs 96 kilograms of fish per day.
- A dolphin needs 8 kilograms of squid per day (instead of 22 kilograms).
- The dolphin's diet remained unchanged for 59 days.

Step 1: Find the total amount of fish required for 59 days.
Total amount of fish required = Amount of fish required per day Ã— Number of days
Total amount of fish required = 96 kilograms Ã— 59 days
Total amount of fish required = 5,664 kilograms

Step 2: Find the total amount of squid required for 59 days.
Total amount of squid required = Amount of squid required per day Ã— Number of days
Total amount of squid required = 8 kilograms Ã— 59 days
Total amount of squid required = 472 kilograms

Step 3: Find the total amount of fish and squid required for 59 days.
Total amount of fish and squid required = Total amount of fish required + Total amount of squid required
Total amount of fish and squid required = 5,664 kilograms + 472 kilograms
Total amount of fish and squid required = 6,136 kilograms

Therefore, if the dolphin had 96 kilograms of fish and only 8 kilograms of squid each day for 59 days, it would need a total of 6,136 kilograms of food.

Step 1: Find the total number of building blocks after receiving the additional blocks.
Initial number of blocks + Additional blocks received = Total number of blocks
18 + 43 = 61 blocks

Step 2: Multiply the total number of blocks by the initial number of blocks.
Total number of blocks Ã— Initial number of blocks = Final number of blocks

Given information:
- Mandy has 1,098 building blocks.
- We need to divide 215 by 43 and multiply the result by 1,098.

Step 1: Divide 215 by 43.
215 Ã· 43 = 5

Step 2: Multiply the result from Step 1 by the number of building blocks Mandy has (1,098).
5 Ã— 1,098 = 5,490

Step 1: Find the total number of building blocks after receiving the additional blocks.
Initial number of blocks + Additional blocks received = Total number of blocks
18 + 55 = 73 blocks

Step 2: Multiply the total number of blocks by the initial number of blocks.
Total number of blocks Ã— Initial number of blocks = Final number of blocks
73 Ã— 18 = 1,314 blocks

Given information:
- The factory makes 13 blankets in the morning.
- The factory makes 81 blankets in the afternoon.
- The factory returns 59 blankets due to defects.
- Each blanket is sold at a price equal to 39 times the total number of good blankets, plus the number of good blankets.

Step 1: Find the total number of blankets made.
Total blankets made = Blankets made in the morning + Blankets made in the afternoon
Total blankets made = 13 + 81 = 94 blankets

Step 2: Find the number of good blankets.
Number of good blankets = Total blankets made - Number of defective blankets
Number of good blankets = 94 - 59 = 35 blankets

Step 3: Calculate the price of each blanket using the given formula.
Price of each blanket = 39 Ã— Total number of good blankets + Number of good blankets
Price of each blanket = 39 Ã— 35 + 35 = 1400

Step 4: Calculate the total value of the blankets sold.
Total value of blankets sold = Price of each blanket Ã— Number of good blankets
Total value of blankets sold = 1400 Ã— 35 = 49,000

Therefore, the total value of the blankets sold by the factory is $49,000.

- The bus travels a total distance of 1300 miles.
- The journey is divided into 20 equal stages.

Step 1: Divide the total distance by the number of stages.
Distance per stage = Total distance / Number of stages
Distance per stage = 1300 miles / 20 stages
Distance per stage = 65 miles

Therefore, the bus travels 65 miles per stage.

Given information:
- The bus travels a total distance of 1300 miles.
- The journey is divided into 4 equal stages.

Step 1: Divide the total distance by the number of stages.
Distance per stage = Total distance / Number of stages
Distance per stage = 1300 miles / 4 stages
Distance per stage = 325 miles

Therefore, if the bus divides the journey into 4 equal stages, it will need to travel 325 miles per stage.

Step 1: Find the deficit in the amount of rain received.
Deficit in the amount of rain = 7 inches

Step 2: Find the amount of rain received in the given year.

Step 1: Find the rate at which the construction company builds the house per day.
Rate of construction per day = Total area built / Total number of days
Rate of construction per day = 1425 square feet / 19 days
Rate of construction per day = 75 square feet per day

Step 2: Calculate the area built in 14 days.
Area built in 14 days = Rate of construction per day Ã— Number of days worked
Area built in 14 days = 75 square feet per day Ã— 14 days

            In a similar situation as before, the farmer started his day with a different quantity of 95 tomatoes in his basket. Just like the previous day, by midday, he managed to harvest some more, bringing the total to 95 + 82 tomatoes in the basket.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of tomatoes in the basket after harvesting, and then subtract the number of unsellable tomatoes.

Given information:
- The farmer starts the day with 95 tomatoes in the basket.
- After harvesting, the total number of tomatoes in the basket is 95 + 82 = 177 tomatoes.
- 37 tomatoes are deemed unsellable because they are not ripe enough.

Step 1: Find the total number of tomatoes in the basket after harvesting.
Total tomatoes after harvesting = 95 + 82 = 177 tomatoes

Step 2: Subtract the number of unsellable tomatoes from the total.
Ripe tomatoes = Total tomatoes after harvesting - Unsellable tomatoes
Ripe tomatoes = 177 - 37 = 140 tomatoes

Therefore, the farmer had 140 ripe tomatoes left in his basket after this day.

- Each bundle contains 16 bars of soap.

Step 1: Find the number of bundles that can be made from 1424 bars.
Number of bundles = Total number of bars / Number of bars per bundle
Number of bundles = 1424 bars / 16 bars per bundle

Given information:
- One large block of soap can be cut into 1424 bars.
- Each bundle now contains 36 bars of soap.

Step 1: Find the number of bundles that can be made from 1424 bars.
Number of bundles = Total number of bars / Number of bars per bundle
Number of bundles = 1424 bars / 36 bars per bundle
Number of bundles = 39.5556 bundles

Since we cannot have a fractional number of bundles, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Number of bundles = 39 bundles

Number of letters printed per second = 2 Ã— 37 = 74 letters

Step 2: Find the total number of letters printed in 95 seconds.
Total number of letters printed = Number of letters printed per second Ã— Number of seconds
Total number of letters printed = 74 letters Ã— 95 seconds

- The printer will continue to print at this rate for 95 seconds.

Step 1: Find the number of letters printed per second.
Number of letters printed per second = Number of sheets Ã— Number of letters per sheet
Number of letters printed per second = 2 Ã— 4 = 8 letters

Step 2: Find the total number of letters printed in 95 seconds.
Total number of letters printed = Number of letters printed per second Ã— Number of seconds
Total number of letters printed = 8 letters Ã— 95 seconds
Total number of letters printed = 760 letters

- They could salvage 44 tons of potatoes.

Step 1: Find the total number of potatoes produced.
Total potatoes produced = Potatoes produced per acre Ã— Number of acres
Total potatoes produced = 12 tons/acre Ã— 3 acres
Total potatoes produced = 36 tons

Step 2: Find the number of potatoes left after subtracting the rotten potatoes and adding the salvaged potatoes.
Potatoes left = Total potatoes produced - Rotten potatoes + Salvaged potatoes
Potatoes left = 36 tons - 71 tons + 44 tons

Total potatoes produced = 168 tons

Step 2: Find the number of potatoes left after subtracting the rotten potatoes and adding the salvaged potatoes.

- The initial rate of sprinkling magical dust is 4332 milligrams every 76 minutes.
- The rate is reduced by 44 milligrams.
- The reduced rate is maintained for 52 minutes.

Step 1: Find the initial rate of sprinkling magical dust per minute.
Initial rate per minute = 4332 milligrams / 76 minutes
Initial rate per minute = 57 milligrams per minute

Step 2: Find the reduced rate of sprinkling magical dust per minute.
Reduced rate per minute = Initial rate per minute - Rate reduction
Reduced rate per minute = 57 milligrams per minute - 44 milligrams per 76 minutes
Reduced rate per minute = 57 milligrams per minute - (44 milligrams / 76 minutes)
Reduced rate per minute = 57 milligrams per minute - 0.579 milligrams per minute
Reduced rate per minute = 56.421 milligrams per minute

Step 3: Calculate the amount of magical dust sprinkled in 52 minutes at the reduced rate.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pictures John had initially, and then subtract the number of pictures that were permanently deleted.

Given information:
- John took 30 pictures with his new camera.
- He accidentally deleted 81 pictures.
- He was able to recover 61 of the deleted pictures.

Step 1: Find the number of pictures that were permanently deleted.
Number of pictures permanently deleted = Total number of pictures deleted - Number of pictures recovered
Number of pictures permanently deleted = 81 - 61 = 20 pictures

Step 2: Find the total number of pictures John has now.
Total number of pictures now = Initial number of pictures - Number of pictures permanently deleted
Total number of pictures now = 30 - 20 = 10 pictures

Therefore, John has 10 pictures now.

Given information:
- The tailor uses 20 square feet of fabric to make one teddy bear.

Step 1: Find the amount of fabric required for one teddy bear.
Amount of fabric required for one teddy bear = 20 square feet

Step 2: Find the amount of fabric required for 20 teddy bears.
Amount of fabric required for 20 teddy bears = Amount of fabric required for one teddy bear Ã— Number of teddy bears
Amount of fabric required for 20 teddy bears = 20 square feet Ã— 20

Given information:
- Cost of each pair of binoculars = $27
- Number of pairs of binoculars bought = 23
- Tax added after buying = $9

Step 1: Find the cost of the binoculars without tax.
Cost of binoculars without tax = Cost of each pair Ã— Number of pairs
Cost of binoculars without tax = $27 Ã— 23
Cost of binoculars without tax = $621

Step 2: Find the total cost by adding the tax to the cost of binoculars without tax.
Total cost = Cost of binoculars without tax + Tax
Total cost = $621 + $9
Total cost = $630

Therefore, the total cost of buying 23 pairs of binoculars with a tax of $9 added after buying is $630.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the 23 pairs of binoculars with tax, and then add the cost of the additional pair of binoculars after applying the discount.

Given information:
- Total cost of 23 pairs of binoculars with tax = $630
- Cost of each pair of binoculars = $27
- Discount on the additional pair of binoculars = $95

Step 1: Find the cost of the additional pair of binoculars after applying the discount.
Cost of the additional pair of binoculars after discount = Cost of each pair - Discount
Cost of the additional pair of binoculars after discount = $27 - $95
Cost of the additional pair of binoculars after discount = -$68

Note: The negative value indicates that the store owner will receive a credit of $68 for the additional pair of binoculars.

Step 2: Find the total amount the store owner needs to pay by subtracting the credit from the total cost of the 23 pairs of binoculars with tax.
Total amount to pay = Total cost of 23 pairs of binoculars with tax - Credit for the additional pair
Total amount to pay = $630 - $68
Total amount to pay = $562

Therefore, the total amount the store owner needs to pay after purchasing the additional pair of binoculars with a discount of $95 is $562.

Given information:
- Cost of each pair of binoculars = $27
- Number of pairs of binoculars bought = 13
- Fixed tax = $9

Step 1: Find the cost of the binoculars without tax.
Cost of binoculars without tax = Cost of each pair Ã— Number of pairs
Cost of binoculars without tax = $27 Ã— 13
Cost of binoculars without tax = $351

Step 2: Find the total cost by adding the tax to the cost of binoculars without tax.
Total cost = Cost of binoculars without tax + Tax
Total cost = $351 + $9
Total cost = $360

- The pirate found 33 gold coins hidden in a chest.

Step 1: Add the number of gold coins found on the island, on the ship, and in the chest.
Number of gold coins found on the island + Number of gold coins found on the ship + Number of gold coins found in the chest = Total number of gold coins

Step 1: Add the number of gold coins found on the island, on another island, and in the chest.
Number of gold coins found on the island + Number of gold coins found on another island + Number of gold coins found in the chest = Total number of gold coins

Step 1: Find the number of complete 22-hour cycles in 33 hours.
Number of complete 22-hour cycles = 33 hours / 22 hours = 1.5 cycles

Step 2: Find the number of phones produced in the first 33 hours.

Number of phones produced in the first 33 hours = 1.5 Ã— 990 = 1485 phones

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In this new scenario, the phone manufacturer adds an additional 80 phones after producing phones for 33 hours.

Given information:
- The manufacturer can produce 990 phones every 22 hours.
- After 33 hours, they add an additional 80 phones to the production batch.

Step 1: Find the number of complete 22-hour cycles in 33 hours.
Number of complete 22-hour cycles = 33 hours / 22 hours = 1.5 cycles

Step 2: Find the number of phones produced in the first 33 hours.
Number of phones produced in the first 33 hours = Number of complete 22-hour cycles Ã— 990 phones
Number of phones produced in the first 33 hours = 1.5 Ã— 990 = 1485 phones

Step 3: Add the additional 80 phones to the production batch.
Total number of phones produced = Number of phones produced in the first 33 hours + Additional phones
Total number of phones produced = 1485 + 80 = 1565 phones

Therefore, with the addition of 80 phones after producing phones for 33 hours, the total number of phones produced at this time is 1565.

Given information:
- The tall building has 704 windows in total.
- The building is 8 floors high.
- Each floor has the same number of windows.

Step 1: Divide the total number of windows by the number of floors to find the number of windows on each floor.
Number of windows on each floor = Total number of windows / Number of floors
Number of windows on each floor = 704 / 8
Number of windows on each floor = 88

Given information:
- The building has 704 windows in total.
- The building has 71 floors.
- Each floor has the same number of windows.

To find the number of windows on each floor, we need to divide the total number of windows by the number of floors.

Step 1: Divide the total number of windows by the number of floors.
Number of windows on each floor = Total number of windows / Number of floors
Number of windows on each floor = 704 / 71
Number of windows on each floor = 9.92 (rounded down to 9)

Therefore, if the building had 704 windows spread over 71 floors, there would be 9 windows on each floor.

- He then makes another 24 candles (scent not specified).
- He combines the newly made candles with the ones he already has.
- Finally, he adds 6 vanilla-scented candles to his collection.

Step 1: Find the total number of candles after making the first 10 candles.
Initial number of candles + Newly made candles = Total candles
37 + 10 = 47 candles

Step 2: Find the total number of candles after making the additional 24 candles.

To find the total number of candles the candlemaker has now, we need to add the number of candles he already had to the number of candles his friend gifted him.

Step 1: Find the total number of candles after receiving the gift from his friend.
Total candles the candlemaker had + Candles gifted by his friend = Total candles now

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between John's cucumbers and 9, and then subtract that difference from John's cucumbers.

Given information:
- John's cucumber plant produces 59 cucumbers.
- Mary's cucumber plant produces as many cucumbers as John's, minus the difference between John's cucumbers and 9.

Step 1: Find the difference between John's cucumbers and 9.
Difference between John's cucumbers and 9 = 59 - 9 = 50

Step 2: Subtract the difference from John's cucumbers to find the number of cucumbers Mary's plant produced.
Mary's cucumbers = John's cucumbers - Difference
Mary's cucumbers = 59 - 50 = 9

Therefore, Mary's cucumber plant produced 9 cucumbers.

Given information:
- Mary's cucumber plant produced 9 cucumbers.
- Sarah already had 54 + 3 = 57 cucumbers before.
- Sarah takes Mary's cucumber count and adds it to the cucumbers she already had.

To find the total number of cucumbers Sarah has now, we need to add Mary's cucumber count to the cucumbers Sarah already had.

Step 1: Find the total number of cucumbers Sarah had before taking Mary's cucumber count.
Sarah's initial cucumbers = 54 + 3 = 57 cucumbers

Step 2: Add Mary's cucumber count to Sarah's initial cucumbers.
Sarah's total cucumbers = Sarah's initial cucumbers + Mary's cucumber count
Sarah's total cucumbers = 57 + 9 = 66 cucumbers

Therefore, Sarah has 66 cucumbers now.

Given information:
- The treasure chest has 35 gemstones.
- Each gemstone is worth 57 gold coins.

Step 1: Find the total value of the gemstones.
Value of each gemstone = 57 gold coins
Total value of gemstones = Number of gemstones Ã— Value of each gemstone
Total value of gemstones = 35 Ã— 57 gold coins
Total value of gemstones = 1,995 gold coins

Step 2: Find the total value of the treasure chest by adding the value of the gemstones and the additional gold coins.
Total value of the treasure chest = Total value of gemstones + Additional gold coins
Total value of the treasure chest = 1,995 gold coins + 42 gold coins

Step 1: Find the total value of the gemstones.
Value of each gemstone = 57 gold coins
Total value of gemstones = Number of gemstones Ã— Value of each gemstone
Total value of gemstones = 6 Ã— 57 gold coins
Total value of gemstones = 342 gold coins

Step 2: Find the total value of the smaller treasure chest by adding the value of the gemstones and the additional gold coins.
Total value of the smaller treasure chest = Total value of gemstones + Additional gold coins

Step 1: Find the number of mice after doubling the quantity of each species.
Number of white mice after doubling = 35 Ã— 2 = 70
Number of brown mice after doubling = 86 Ã— 2 = 172
Number of black mice after doubling = 39 Ã— 2 = 78

Step 2: Find the total number of mice after doubling the quantity of each species.
Total number of mice after doubling = Number of white mice after doubling + Number of brown mice after doubling + Number of black mice after doubling

            After reviewing the production data, the toy car factory realized there was a mistake in their calculation. They actually produce only 4 toy cars every minute instead of 5.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to recalculate the number of toy cars produced in 76 minutes using the corrected production rate of 4 toy cars per minute, and then add the additional batch of 49 toy cars.

Given information:
- The toy factory produces 4 toy cars every minute (corrected production rate).
- After 76 minutes, they add another batch of 49 toy cars.

Step 1: Find the number of toy cars produced in 76 minutes with the corrected production rate.
Number of toy cars produced in 76 minutes = Production rate per minute Ã— Number of minutes
Number of toy cars produced in 76 minutes = 4 toy cars/minute Ã— 76 minutes
Number of toy cars produced in 76 minutes = 304 toy cars

Step 2: Find the total number of toy cars by adding the additional batch of 49 toy cars.
Total number of toy cars = Number of toy cars produced in 76 minutes + Additional batch of toy cars
Total number of toy cars = 304 toy cars + 49 toy cars
Total number of toy cars = 353 toy cars

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total area of the farmland after the expansion and then subtract the area that was returned due to legal issues.

Given information:
- The initial farmland spans across 9 km.
- The owner expanded the property by 77 km.
- The owner had to return 71 km due to legal issues.

Step 1: Find the total area of the farmland after the expansion.
Initial farmland area + Expansion area = Total area after expansion
9 km + 77 km = 86 km

Step 2: Find the area of the farmland after returning 71 km.
Total area after expansion - Area returned = Final area of the farmland
86 km - 71 km = 15 km

Therefore, the farmer has 15 km left after the expansion and subsequent decrease.

Given information:
- The initial farmland area is 25 km.
- The farmer expanded the property by 77 km.
- The farmer had to return 71 km due to legal issues.

Step 1: Find the total area of the farmland after the expansion.
Initial farmland area + Expansion area = Total area after expansion
25 km + 77 km = 102 km

Step 2: Find the area of the farmland after returning 71 km.
Total area after expansion - Area returned = Final area of the farmland
102 km - 71 km = 31 km

Therefore, the second farmer has 31 km left after the expansion and subsequent decrease.

Given information:
- The paint company is preparing 8930 liters of a specific color.
- Each paint bucket can hold 95 liters of paint.

Step 1: Divide the total amount of paint by the capacity of each bucket.
Number of buckets = Total amount of paint / Capacity of each bucket
Number of buckets = 8930 liters / 95 liters per bucket
Number of buckets = 94 buckets

Therefore, the paint company will be able to fill up 94 buckets completely with the 8930 liters of paint.

- The company was missing 73 paint buckets after the initial sales.
- The company found 59 buckets in the warehouse.

Step 1: Find the number of buckets the company can fill initially.
Number of buckets = Total amount of paint / Capacity of each bucket
Number of buckets = 8930 liters / 95 liters per bucket
Number of buckets = 94 buckets

Step 2: Find the number of buckets the company has after adding the found buckets.
Number of buckets after adding found buckets = Initial number of buckets - Missing buckets + Found buckets

Step 1: Find the ratio of bubbles to ounces of bubble fluid.
Ratio of bubbles to ounces = 3654 bubbles / 87 ounces
Ratio of bubbles to ounces = 42 bubbles per ounce

Step 2: Use the ratio to find the number of bubbles that can be made with 1 ounce of bubble fluid.
Number of bubbles with 1 ounce = 42 bubbles per ounce Ã— 1 ounce

Ratio of bubbles to ounces = 77.74 bubbles per ounce

Step 2: Use the ratio to find the number of bubbles that can be made with 1 ounce of bubble fluid.
Number of bubbles with 1 ounce = 77.74 bubbles per ounce Ã— 1 ounce

Step 1: Find the number of apples needed for one jug of apple juice.
Number of apples per jug = 13 apples

Step 2: Find the total number of apples needed for 30 jugs of apple juice.
Total number of apples = Number of apples per jug Ã— Number of jugs

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of seashells that appeared on the beach during the 42 days and add the additional 56 seashells that were hidden in the sand.

Given information:
- 74 seashells appear on the beach every day.
- The beachcomber collected seashells for 42 days.
- The beachcomber also discovered an additional 56 seashells hidden in the sand.

Step 1: Find the total number of seashells that appeared on the beach during the 42 days.
Number of seashells appearing per day Ã— Number of days = Total seashells appearing on the beach
74 seashells Ã— 42 days = 3,108 seashells

Step 2: Add the additional 56 seashells that were hidden in the sand.
Total seashells appearing on the beach + Additional seashells hidden in the sand = Total seashells collected
3,108 seashells + 56 seashells = 3,164 seashells

Therefore, the beachcomber had a total of 3,164 seashells after 42 days of collection.

            Building on our beachcomber's tale, after counting his 42-day collection of seashells, he accidentally loses one seashell down a seaside crevice. Disappointed but not defeated, he decides to collect 32 more seashells the next day. How many seashells does he have in total after adding the new batch and accounting for the lost seashell?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of seashells the beachcomber had after the 42-day collection, subtract the one seashell that was lost, and then add the 32 seashells collected the next day.

Given information:
- The beachcomber had a total of 3,164 seashells after the 42-day collection.
- The beachcomber lost one seashell down a seaside crevice.
- The beachcomber collected 32 more seashells the next day.

Step 1: Find the number of seashells the beachcomber had after losing one seashell.
Total seashells after 42-day collection - Seashells lost = Remaining seashells
3,164 seashells - 1 seashell = 3,163 seashells

Step 2: Add the 32 seashells collected the next day to the remaining seashells.
Remaining seashells + Seashells collected the next day = Total seashells
3,163 seashells + 32 seashells = 3,195 seashells

Therefore, after adding the new batch of 32 seashells and accounting for the lost seashell, the beachcomber had a total of 3,195 seashells.

            Let's revisit our beachcomber. After reconsidering his collection habit, he realizes he has been actually collecting an average of 89 seashells per day instead of 74, over the same 42 day period. He still found that additional 56 seashells hidden in the sand. Now, how many seashells does he have in total after 42 days?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of seashells that appeared on the beach during the 42 days, considering the revised average of 89 seashells per day, and then add the additional 56 seashells that were hidden in the sand.

Given information:
- The beachcomber collected an average of 89 seashells per day.
- The beachcomber collected seashells for 42 days.
- The beachcomber also discovered an additional 56 seashells hidden in the sand.

Step 1: Find the total number of seashells that appeared on the beach during the 42 days.
Average number of seashells collected per day Ã— Number of days = Total seashells appearing on the beach
89 seashells Ã— 42 days = 3,738 seashells

Step 2: Add the additional 56 seashells that were hidden in the sand.
Total seashells appearing on the beach + Additional seashells hidden in the sand = Total seashells collected
3,738 seashells + 56 seashells = 3,794 seashells

Therefore, after reconsidering his collection habit, the beachcomber had a total of 3,794 seashells after 42 days of collection.
