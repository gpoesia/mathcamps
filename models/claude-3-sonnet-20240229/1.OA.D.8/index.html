Given information:
- The game starts with the number 13.
- To reach the number 14, a certain number must be added.

To find the number that needs to be added, we can subtract 13 from 14.

14 - 13 = 1

Therefore, the number that needs to be added to 13 to reach 14 is 1.

Given information:
- The car rental company had a total of 17 cars available in the morning.
- At the end of the day, they had 4 cars left.

Step 1: Find the number of cars rented out during the day.
Number of cars rented out = Total cars available in the morning - Cars left at the end of the day
Number of cars rented out = 17 - 4
Number of cars rented out = 13

Therefore, 13 cars were rented out during the day.

Given information:
- The butterfly collector caught 13 butterflies in the morning.
- At the end of the day, there were 6 butterflies in the collection.

Step 1: Find the number of butterflies that flew away during the day.
Number of butterflies that flew away = Number of butterflies caught in the morning - Number of butterflies remaining at the end of the day
Number of butterflies that flew away = 13 - 6
Number of butterflies that flew away = 7

Therefore, 7 butterflies flew away during the day.

Given information:
- There is one piece of cake left.
- The whole cake was cut into h equal slices.
- 12 pieces have been eaten during the party.

Let's represent the total number of slices in the whole cake as h.

Since 12 slices have been eaten and one slice is left, we can write the equation:

12 + 1 = h

Solving for h:
h = 12 + 1
h = 13

Therefore, the whole cake was cut into 13 equal slices.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pairs of socks Anne had originally before buying the new pairs.

Given information:
- Anne bought 15 new pairs of socks.
- After buying the new pairs, she has a total of 20 pairs of socks.

Let's represent the number of pairs of socks Anne had originally as x.

We know that the total number of pairs of socks after buying the new pairs is the sum of the original pairs and the new pairs.

Total pairs after buying = Original pairs + New pairs
20 = x + 15

Rearranging the equation, we get:
x = 20 - 15
x = 5

Therefore, Anne originally had 5 pairs of socks before buying the new 15 pairs.

Given information:
- The party decorator started with 8 helium balloons.
- After the accidents, only 1 balloon remained uninflated.

Let's assume that the number of balloons inflated before the accidents is x.

Since the decorator started with 8 balloons and only 1 remained uninflated, we can write the equation:
x + 1 = 8

Solving for x:
x = 8 - 1
x = 7

Therefore, the decorator accidentally inflated 7 balloons.

- The total number of binoculars Bill has, including the ones found in the attic, is 19 pairs.

Step 1: Convert the number of pairs into the number of individual binoculars.
Number of binoculars found in the drawer = 1 pair Ã— 2 binoculars per pair = 2 binoculars
Total number of binoculars = 19 pairs Ã— 2 binoculars per pair = 38 binoculars

Step 2: Find the number of binoculars Bill found in the attic.
Number of binoculars found in the attic = Total number of binoculars - Number of binoculars found in the drawer
Number of binoculars found in the attic = 38 binoculars - 2 binoculars = 36 binoculars

Step 3: Convert the number of individual binoculars found in the attic back to pairs.

Since the total number of colors is 12, and 6 of them are warm colors, we can find the number of cool colors by subtracting the number of warm colors from the total number of colors.

Number of cool colors = Total number of colors - Number of warm colors
Number of cool colors = 12 - 6
Number of cool colors = 6

Therefore, there were 6 cool colors in the color palette.

Let's represent the speed of the river in the early morning as x.

According to the given information, we can write an equation:
x + 4 = 6 (since the speed in the late morning is 4 km/hr more than the speed in the early morning)

x - 3 = 15
x = 15 + 3
x = 18

Therefore, there were originally 18 people at the party before anyone left.

Given information:
- The farmer initially had 9 apple trees in his orchard.
- After planting new apple trees, the total number of apple trees became 18.

Let's represent the number of new apple trees planted as x.

Initial number of apple trees + Number of new apple trees planted = Total number of apple trees after planting
9 + x = 18

Rearranging the equation to find x:
x = 18 - 9
x = 9

Therefore, the farmer planted 9 new apple trees.

Given information:
- Chris gave away 4 skateboards to friends.
- After giving away 4 skateboards, Chris has 8 skateboards left.

Let's represent the initial number of skateboards as x.

After giving away 4 skateboards, the remaining number of skateboards is x - 4.
We know that the remaining number of skateboards is 8.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x - 4 = 8

Solving for x:
x - 4 + 4 = 8 + 4
x = 12

Therefore, Chris had 12 skateboards at the beginning before giving away 4 of them.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of guitar picks John started with initially.

Given information:
- John has 6 guitar picks left.
- He lost 1 guitar pick.

Let's assume that John started with x guitar picks initially.

After losing 1 guitar pick, he would have x - 1 guitar picks.
We know that he has 6 guitar picks left, so we can write the equation:

x - 1 = 6

Solving for x:
x = 6 + 1
x = 7

Therefore, John originally started with 7 guitar picks.

Given information:
- The fruit seller initially had 14 oranges in his basket.
- After collecting some oranges from his garden, he had a total of 16 oranges.

Let's represent the number of oranges collected from the garden as x.

Initial number of oranges + Oranges collected from the garden = Total number of oranges
14 + x = 16

Rearranging the equation to find x:
x = 16 - 14
x = 2

Therefore, the fruit seller collected 2 oranges from his garden.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the original number of tigers the circus had before selling 3 of them.

Given information:
- After selling 3 tigers, the circus has 8 tigers left.

Let's represent the original number of tigers as x.

Since the circus sold 3 tigers, we can write the equation:
x - 3 = 8

Solving for x:
x - 3 = 8
x = 8 + 3
x = 11

Therefore, the circus had 11 tigers originally before selling 3 of them.

Given information:
- The original tiger population in the nature reserve was 15.
- After perilous conditions, only 5 tigers remained in the reserve.

Step 1: Find the number of tigers lost.
Number of tigers lost = Original tiger population - Remaining tiger population
Number of tigers lost = 15 - 5
Number of tigers lost = 10

Given information:
- The shape enthusiast initially had 15 different types of shapes.
- After giving some away, she was left with 11 different types of shapes.

Step 1: Find the number of different types of shapes given away.
Number of different types of shapes given away = Initial number of different types of shapes - Number of different types of shapes left
Number of different types of shapes given away = 15 - 11
Number of different types of shapes given away = 4

Therefore, the shape enthusiast gave away 4 different types of shapes.

Given information:
- By noon, the hat maker sold 6 hats.
- After selling 6 hats, the hat maker was left with 9 hats.

Let's represent the initial number of wool hats as x.

Initial number of hats = x
Number of hats sold = 6
Number of hats remaining = 9

We know that the initial number of hats minus the number of hats sold should be equal to the number of hats remaining.

x - 6 = 9

Solving for x:
x = 9 + 6
x = 15

Therefore, the hat maker started the day with 15 wool hats in his shop.

Given information:
- The bike shop had 4 mountain bikes at the beginning of the day.
- The bike shop had a total of 14 mountain bikes at the end of the day.

Step 1: Find the number of new mountain bikes shipped to the shop.
Number of new mountain bikes shipped = Total mountain bikes at the end of the day - Mountain bikes at the beginning of the day
Number of new mountain bikes shipped = 14 - 4
Number of new mountain bikes shipped = 10

Therefore, 10 new mountain bikes were shipped to the bike shop today.

Given information:
- The child starts with 2 blue colored pencils.
- After receiving some blue colored pencils from their classmate, the child has 3 blue colored pencils.

Let's represent the number of blue colored pencils given by the classmate as x.

Initial number of blue colored pencils + Number of blue colored pencils given by the classmate = Final number of blue colored pencils
2 + x = 3

Solving for x:
x = 3 - 2
x = 1

Therefore, the classmate gave the child 1 blue colored pencil.

Given information:
- A young giraffe was 1 meter shorter than a full-grown giraffe when it was 3 meters tall.
- Let x be the typical height of a fully grown giraffe in meters.

We can represent the height of the young giraffe when it was 3 meters tall as (x - 1) meters, since it was 1 meter shorter than a full-grown giraffe.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
x - 1 = 3

Solving for x:
x - 1 = 3
x = 3 + 1
x = 4

Therefore, the typical height of a fully grown giraffe is 4 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of snowballs used to build the snowman before removing any snowballs.

Given information:
- After removing 7 snowballs, 11 snowballs remain.

Let's represent the original number of snowballs as x.

Since 7 snowballs were removed, and 11 snowballs remain, we can write the equation:
x - 7 = 11

Rearranging the equation to solve for x:
x = 11 + 7
x = 18

Therefore, the original number of snowballs used to build the snowman was 18.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the final number of mermaids and the initial number of mermaids.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 10 mermaids in the underwater kingdom.
- After a while, there were 20 mermaids in the underwater kingdom.

Step 1: Find the increase in the number of mermaids.
Increase in the number of mermaids = Final number of mermaids - Initial number of mermaids
Increase in the number of mermaids = 20 - 10
Increase in the number of mermaids = 10 mermaids

Therefore, 10 new mermaids joined the underwater kingdom.
