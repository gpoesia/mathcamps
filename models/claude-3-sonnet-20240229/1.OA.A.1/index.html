        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of letter games Aliyah correctly guessed.

Given information:
- Aliyah correctly guessed 11 letter games initially.
- Then, she correctly guessed 7 more games.
- After that, she lost 6 times in the next game.

Step 1: Find the total number of games Aliyah correctly guessed before losing 6 times.
Number of games correctly guessed initially + Number of games correctly guessed later
= 11 + 7
= 18 games

Step 2: Losing 6 times in the next game does not affect the number of games she has already correctly guessed.

Therefore, the total number of letter games Aliyah correctly guessed in the end is 18.

Given information:
- The pilot started the day with 4 helicopters in his base.
- During the day, 13 more helicopters arrived.

To find the total number of helicopters, we need to add the initial number of helicopters and the number of helicopters that arrived.

Total number of helicopters = Initial number of helicopters + Number of helicopters that arrived
Total number of helicopters = 4 + 13
Total number of helicopters = 17

Therefore, the pilot has a total of 17 helicopters at his base.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of strawberries remaining after the bird ate 2 of them.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 18 strawberries on the farm.
- A little bird came by and ate 2 strawberries.

To find the number of strawberries left, we need to subtract the number of strawberries eaten by the bird from the initial number of strawberries.

Number of strawberries left = Initial number of strawberries - Number of strawberries eaten by the bird
Number of strawberries left = 18 - 2
Number of strawberries left = 16

Therefore, after the little bird ate 2 strawberries, there were 16 strawberries left on the farm.

Given information:
- After the little bird ate 2 strawberries, there were 16 strawberries left on the farm.
- The farmer planted 2 more strawberry plants.

We don't know how many strawberries each new plant will produce, but we can assume that each new plant will have at least one strawberry.

Therefore, the minimum number of new strawberries added to the farm is 2 (one from each new plant).

Total number of strawberries on the farm now = Number of strawberries left after the bird ate + Number of new strawberries from the new plants
Total number of strawberries on the farm now = 16 + 2
Total number of strawberries on the farm now = 18

Therefore, after the farmer planted 2 more strawberry plants, there are at least 18 strawberries on the farm now.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 18 strawberries on the farm.
- The little bird ate 4 strawberries.

To find the number of strawberries left, we need to subtract the number of strawberries eaten by the bird from the initial number of strawberries.

Number of strawberries left = Initial number of strawberries - Number of strawberries eaten by the bird
Number of strawberries left = 18 - 4
Number of strawberries left = 14

Therefore, after the little bird ate 4 strawberries, there were 14 strawberries left on the farm.

- Isabella needs to buy toothbrushes for her 2 best friends.

Step 1: Find the number of toothbrushes needed for her 2 best friends.
Number of toothbrushes needed for her 2 best friends = 2

Step 2: Find the total number of toothbrushes Isabella needs to buy.
Total number of toothbrushes needed = Number of toothbrushes for family members + Number of toothbrushes for best friends

Given information:
- Isabella needs to buy 13 toothbrushes for her family members and her 2 best friends.
- Isabella decides to buy 2 extra toothbrushes just in case.

To find the total number of toothbrushes Isabella ends up buying, we need to add the number of extra toothbrushes to the initial number of toothbrushes needed.

Total number of toothbrushes Isabella ends up buying = Initial number of toothbrushes needed + Number of extra toothbrushes
Total number of toothbrushes Isabella ends up buying = 13 + 2
Total number of toothbrushes Isabella ends up buying = 15

Therefore, Isabella ends up buying a total of 15 toothbrushes.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of earrings Sara has left after gifting 12 earrings to her best friend.

Given information:
- Sara initially had 17 earrings.
- Sara donated 2 earrings to charity, leaving her with 15 earrings.
- Sara decides to gift 12 more earrings to her best friend.

Step 1: Find the number of earrings Sara has after gifting 12 earrings to her best friend.
Number of earrings Sara has left = Number of earrings after donating - Number of earrings gifted
Number of earrings Sara has left = 15 - 12
Number of earrings Sara has left = 3

Therefore, after gifting 12 earrings to her best friend, Sara has 3 earrings left.

- Mason's friend gave him 11 more bananas instead of 19.

To find the total number of bananas Mason has now, we need to add the number of bananas he originally had with the number of bananas his friend gave him.

Step 1: Find the total number of bananas Mason has now.
Number of bananas Mason had initially + Number of bananas his friend gave him = Total number of bananas Mason has now
1 + 11 = 12

Therefore, if Mason's friend gave him 11 more bananas instead of 19, Mason would have 12 bananas in total.

To calculate the new total number of pages, we need to:

2. Add that to the initial number of pages

First, let's find out how many extra pages she is adding:
* For each existing page, she is adding 1 extra page
* She had 1 existing page
* So she is adding 1 extra page

Now, we can calculate the new total:
* Initial number of pages: 1
* Extra pages added: 1
* New total = Initial number + Extra pages
* New total = 1 + 1 = 2

Therefore, Katie's research paper now has a total of 2 pages.

Given information:
- Initially, there are 9 monkey bars on the jungle gym.

Step 1: Find the total number of monkey bars after the addition.
Total number of monkey bars = Initial number of monkey bars + Additional monkey bars
Total number of monkey bars = 9 + 5
Total number of monkey bars = 14

To find the number of lemons left, we need to subtract the number of lemons used from the initial number of lemons.

Step 1: Find the number of lemons left.

So, we can deduce that:

* This means that 9 - 5 = 4 papers from the new pile are still ungraded

Therefore, the total number of ungraded papers the teacher has now is:

Number of mice caught on the first day after the escape = 14 - 4 = 10 mice

Step 2: Find the total number of mice the cat caught in both days.
Total number of mice caught = Number of mice caught on the first day after the escape + Number of mice caught on the second day

Step 1: Find the number of mice the cat caught on the first day after the escape.
Number of mice caught on the first day after the escape = Total mice caught on the first day - Number of mice that escaped
Number of mice caught on the first day after the escape = 6 - 4 = 2 mice

Step 2: Find the total number of mice the cat caught in both days.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate with the new information.

Given information:
- The farmer initially had 9 cows in the field.
- The farmer brought 5 more cows into the field (instead of 4).

To find the total number of cows in the field now, we need to add the initial number of cows and the number of cows brought in.

Total number of cows = Initial number of cows + Number of cows brought in
Total number of cows = 9 + 5
Total number of cows = 14

Therefore, if the farmer brought 5 cows into the field instead of 4, he would now have 14 cows in that field.

Given information:
- Paul has 1 foot of rope already.
- He adds an additional length of 11 feet.

Step 1: Convert the lengths to the same unit (feet).
Paul's initial length of rope = 1 foot
Additional length of rope added = 11 feet

Step 2: Add the two lengths together.
Total length of rope = Initial length + Additional length
Total length of rope = 1 foot + 11 feet
Total length of rope = 12 feet

Therefore, Paul now has a total length of 12 feet of rope.

Now, we need to add the extra 5 feet of rope that Paul found in his toolbox to the 12 feet he already had.

Given information:
- Paul initially had 12 feet of rope.
- He found an extra 5 feet of rope in his toolbox.

Step 1: Add the length of rope Paul already had with the extra length he found.
Total length of rope = Initial length + Extra length found
Total length of rope = 12 feet + 5 feet
Total length of rope = 17 feet

Therefore, after adding the extra 5 feet of rope from his toolbox, Paul now has a total length of 17 feet of rope.

Given information:
- Paul initially had 3 feet of rope.
- He added an additional length of 11 feet.

To find the total length of rope Paul now has, we need to add the initial length and the additional length.

Step 1: Identify the initial length and the additional length.
Initial length of rope = 3 feet
Additional length of rope = 11 feet

Step 2: Add the initial length and the additional length.
Total length of rope = Initial length + Additional length
Total length of rope = 3 feet + 11 feet
Total length of rope = 14 feet

Therefore, with the initial length of 3 feet and the additional length of 11 feet, Paul now has a total length of 14 feet of rope.

* Initially, the farmer had 11 ducks
* One new duckling joined, so the total became 12 ducks
* Then, 2 ducks wandered off and got lost

To find the current number of ducks, we take the total after the new duckling joined (12) and subtract the number of ducks that wandered off (2).

So:
* Total ducks after new duckling joined = 12
* Ducks that wandered off = 2
* Current number of ducks = 12 - 2 = 10

Therefore, the farmer now has 10 ducks.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's take this step-by-step:

Initially, Catherine had 5 roses in her front garden.
Then, she planted 8 more roses, so the total became:
5 + 8 = 13 roses

After that, her little brother added 4 more roses to the garden.
So, we need to add 4 to the previous total of 13 roses.

13 roses + 4 more roses = 17 roses

Therefore, after Catherine's little brother added 4 more roses, there are now a total of 17 roses in the garden.

Given information:
- Catherine initially had 3 roses in her front garden.
- She planted 8 more roses.

Step 1: Find the total number of roses after planting the additional 8 roses.
Initial number of roses + Additional roses planted = Total number of roses
3 + 8 = 11

Therefore, if Catherine initially had 3 roses in her front garden before planting the additional 8 roses, she would now have a total of 11 roses in her front garden.

Given information:
- Initially, George had 7 boats.
- George sold 2 boats to Billy, leaving him with 5 boats.
- George then bought 14 more boats.

Step 1: Find the number of boats George had after selling 2 boats.
Number of boats George had after selling 2 boats = 7 - 2 = 5 boats

Step 2: Find the total number of boats George has after buying 14 more boats.
Total number of boats George has now = Number of boats after selling 2 boats + Number of boats bought
Total number of boats George has now = 5 + 14
Total number of boats George has now = 19 boats

Step 1: Subtract the number of passengers who exited the plane from the initial number of passengers.
Number of passengers left on the plane = Initial number of passengers - Number of passengers who exited

- 1 passenger exited the plane before it took off, leaving 14 passengers on the plane.
- After the plane took off, another passenger decided to skydive, leaving the plane mid-flight.

To find the number of passengers left on the plane after the skydiver exited, we need to subtract 1 from the previous number of passengers on the plane.

Step 1: Subtract 1 from the previous number of passengers on the plane.
Number of passengers left on the plane = Previous number of passengers on the plane - 1
Number of passengers left on the plane = 14 - 1
Number of passengers left on the plane = 13

Therefore, after the skydiver exited the plane mid-flight, there are 13 passengers left on the plane.

Given information:
- Sal traveled 9 inches in the morning.
- Sal traveled 6 inches in the afternoon.

Step 1: Add the distances traveled in the morning and afternoon.
Distance traveled in the morning + Distance traveled in the afternoon = Total distance traveled in one day
9 inches + 6 inches = 15 inches

Therefore, with the updated information, Sal traveled a total of 15 inches in one day.

Given:
- The forest initially had 18 trees.
- 10 trees were cut down.
- The goal is to have a total of 17 trees in the forest.

Step 1: Find the number of trees remaining after cutting down 10 trees.
Number of trees remaining = Total number of trees - Number of trees cut down
Number of trees remaining = 18 - 10 = 8 trees

Step 2: Find the number of trees needed to be planted to reach the goal of 17 trees.
Number of trees needed to be planted = Target number of trees - Number of trees remaining
Number of trees needed to be planted = 17 - 8 = 9 trees

Given information:
- The forest originally had 18 trees.
- 4 trees were cut down.

To find the number of trees left standing, we need to subtract the number of trees cut down from the original number of trees.

Step 1: Find the number of trees remaining after cutting down 4 trees.
Number of trees remaining = Original number of trees - Number of trees cut down
Number of trees remaining = 18 - 4
Number of trees remaining = 14

Therefore, if the forest originally had 18 trees and only 4 trees were cut down, there would be 14 trees left standing in the forest.

* We know from the previous problem that Sara initially had 5 scooters
* The new information is that she can make another identical line with the same number of scooters
* This means she has enough scooters to make two identical lines
* If she has enough for two identical lines, then the number of scooters she has must be an even number
* The only even number of scooters that can make two identical lines of 5 is 10
* So if she combines both lines, she must have 10 scooters in total

To confirm with the given information:
* Sara initially had 5 scooters
* She can make another identical line with 5 scooters
* So when she combines both lines, she has 5 + 5 = 10 scooters

Number of potatoes remaining = 11 - 8 = 3 potatoes

Step 2: Find the total number of potatoes in the new sack by adding the remaining potatoes to the potatoes already present in the other sack.

To find the number of potatoes left in the sack, we need to subtract the number of spoiled potatoes disposed of from the initial number of potatoes in the new sack.

Number of potatoes left in the sack = Initial number of potatoes in the new sack - Number of spoiled potatoes disposed of

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of apples the clown had initially and then subtract the number of apples taken away by his partner.

Given:
- The clown was juggling 20 apples after adding an extra apple for a challenge.
- The clown's partner takes 18 apples away from the total.

Step 1: Find the number of apples the clown had initially.
Number of apples the clown had initially = 20 apples

Step 2: Find the number of apples the clown has left after his partner takes away 18 apples.
Number of apples left = Number of apples initially - Number of apples taken away
Number of apples left = 20 - 18 = 2 apples

Therefore, the clown has 2 apples left to juggle now.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Let's go back to the clown's juggling act. This time, instead of adding 16 apples to his initial 3, he adds only 9 to the 3 he's already juggling. Then he proceeds to add an extra apple again for a challenge. How many apples is the clown juggling now with this reset?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's reset the problem with the new information.

Given:
- Initially, the clown juggles 3 apples.
- Then, he adds 9 more apples to the initial 3 apples.
- Later, he decides to add an extra apple for a challenge.

Step 1: Find the number of apples the clown was juggling after adding 9 more apples to the initial 3 apples.
Number of apples after adding 9 more = Initial number of apples + 9
Number of apples after adding 9 more = 3 + 9 = 12 apples

Step 2: Find the number of apples the clown is juggling now after adding an extra apple.
Number of apples after adding an extra apple = Number of apples after adding 9 more + 1
Number of apples after adding an extra apple = 12 + 1 = 13 apples

Therefore, with this reset, the clown is juggling 13 apples now.

* Initially, the pirate had 13 gold coins in his chest
* He spent 4 coins to bribe a fellow pirate
* So he had 13 - 4 = 9 coins left
* Then he found 7 more coins on the treasure hunt

To find the total number of coins he has now, we need to add the coins he found to the coins he had left:
* Total coins = Coins left + Coins found
* Total coins = 9 + 7
* Total coins = 16

Therefore, after finding 7 more gold coins on the treasure hunt, the pirate now has a total of 16 gold coins in his chest.

Given information:
- Max put together 1 tent for himself.
- Max was joined by 7 friends.
- Each of his friends needed their own tent.

Step 1: Find the number of tents needed for Max's friends.
Number of tents needed for friends = Number of friends
Number of tents needed for friends = 7

Step 2: Find the total number of tents Max put up.
Total number of tents = Number of tents for Max + Number of tents for friends
Total number of tents = 1 + 7
Total number of tents = 8

Therefore, Max put up a total of 8 tents during the camping trip.

* Initially, Max set up 1 tent for himself
* Then he set up 7 tents for his 7 friends
* So the total number of tents he had set up was 1 + 7 = 8 tents

Now, we have additional information:
* Another group of 9 friends showed up unexpectedly
* Max assembled tents for each of them too

To find the new total number of tents:
* Number of tents for the new group of 9 friends = 9
* Total number of tents = Initial number of tents + Number of tents for new group
* Total number of tents = 8 + 9
* Total number of tents = 17

Therefore, Max has set up a total of 17 tents now.

Given information:
- Max initially set up 11 tents for a group of scouts.
- Max's 7 friends joined, and each needed their own tent.

Step 1: Find the number of tents needed for Max's friends.
Number of tents needed for friends = Number of friends
Number of tents needed for friends = 7

Step 2: Find the total number of tents Max set up.
Total number of tents = Initial number of tents for scouts + Number of tents for friends
Total number of tents = 11 + 7
Total number of tents = 18

Therefore, if Max initially set up 11 tents for a group of scouts and then added 7 more tents for his friends, he would have set up a total of 18 tents.

Total number of pairs of pants = Initial number of pairs + New pairs bought
Total number of pairs of pants = 14 + 6
Total number of pairs of pants = 20

- He bought 5 more pairs from a garage sale.

Step 1: Find the number of pairs of roller skates John had after giving away 2 pairs.

Given information:
- Daisy initially had 13 lemons.
- Daisy used 2 lemons for making lemonade.

Step 1: Find the number of lemons Daisy has left.
Number of lemons left = Initial number of lemons - Number of lemons used
Number of lemons left = 13 - 2
Number of lemons left = 11

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given:
- Daisy had 11 lemons left after making lemonade.
- Daisy bought 8 more lemons from the store.

To find the total number of lemons Daisy has now, we need to add the number of lemons she had left and the number of lemons she bought.

Step 1: Number of lemons Daisy had left
Number of lemons left = 11

Step 2: Number of lemons Daisy bought
Number of lemons bought = 8

Step 3: Total number of lemons Daisy has now
Total number of lemons = Number of lemons left + Number of lemons bought
Total number of lemons = 11 + 8
Total number of lemons = 19

Therefore, after buying 8 more lemons from the store, Daisy now has 19 lemons.

Given information:
- William's robot can score a total of 13 points.
- Due to a technical malfunction, it scored 8 points less.
- After fixing the issue, he managed to accrue an additional 5 points.

Step 1: Find the robot's score after the technical malfunction.
Robot's initial score - Points lost due to malfunction = Score after malfunction
13 points - 8 points = 5 points

Step 2: Find the robot's total score after accruing additional points.
Score after malfunction + Additional points earned = Total score
5 points + 5 points = 10 points

Therefore, William's robot's total score after fixing the issue and accruing additional points is 10 points.

Given information:
- William's robot's total score was 10 points.
- The robot encounters another malfunction and loses 3 points from its total score.

To find the robot's new total score, we need to subtract the points lost due to the malfunction from the previous total score.

Step 1: Calculate the robot's new total score after the malfunction.
Previous total score - Points lost due to malfunction = New total score
10 points - 3 points = 7 points

Therefore, after encountering another malfunction and losing 3 points, William's robot's new total score is 7 points.

* Initially, there were 12 rainbows visible in the sky
* After that, one of the rainbows faded away

To find the number of rainbows that remained visible, we need to subtract the number of rainbows that faded away from the initial number of rainbows.

Given:
- Initial number of rainbows = 12
- Number of rainbows that faded away = 1

Number of rainbows that remained visible = Initial number of rainbows - Number of rainbows that faded away
Number of rainbows that remained visible = 12 - 1
Number of rainbows that remained visible = 11

Therefore, at the end of the day, 11 rainbows remained visible in the sky.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's continue from the previous problem.

Previously, we found that Alexa ended up with 16 pairs of earrings after giving 2 pairs to her best friend.

Now, she has found 2 more pairs of earrings that she had misplaced earlier.

To find the total number of pairs of earrings Alexa has now, we need to add the 2 pairs she found to her current collection.

Given information:
- Alexa had 16 pairs of earrings after giving 2 pairs away.
- She found 2 more pairs of earrings that she had misplaced.

Total number of pairs of earrings Alexa has now = Current number of pairs + Number of pairs found
Total number of pairs of earrings Alexa has now = 16 pairs + 2 pairs
Total number of pairs of earrings Alexa has now = 18 pairs

Therefore, after finding the 2 pairs of earrings she had misplaced, Alexa now has a total of 18 pairs of earrings.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pairs of earrings Alexa has after buying the new ones and then subtract the number of pairs she gave to her best friend.

Given information:
- Alexa initially has 7 pairs of earrings.
- She buys 12 more pairs from an online shop.
- She gives 2 pairs to her best friend.

Step 1: Find the total number of pairs of earrings Alexa has after buying the new ones.
Initial number of pairs + Number of pairs bought = Total number of pairs
7 pairs + 12 pairs = 19 pairs

Step 2: Subtract the number of pairs Alexa gave to her best friend from the total number of pairs.
Total number of pairs - Number of pairs given away = Number of pairs Alexa ends up with
19 pairs - 2 pairs = 17 pairs

Therefore, Alexa ends up with 17 pairs of earrings after giving 2 pairs to her best friend.

Given information:
- A standard deck of cards has 2 suits: hearts and spades.
- There is 1 additional special suit in this deck.

To find the total number of suits, we need to add the number of standard suits and the special suit.

Number of standard suits = 2 (hearts and spades)
Number of special suits = 1

Total number of suits = Number of standard suits + Number of special suits
Total number of suits = 2 + 1
Total number of suits = 3

Therefore, there are 3 suits in total in the deck.

Step 1: Find the number of dolls Mary has left after giving away 6 dolls.
Number of dolls Mary has left = Initial number of dolls - Number of dolls given away
Number of dolls Mary has left = 9 - 6

- He found and added 6 more parrots to his crew.

To find the total number of parrots, we need to add the initial number of parrots and the number of parrots added.

Total number of parrots = Initial number of parrots + Number of parrots added
Total number of parrots = 3 + 6
Total number of parrots = 9

Therefore, Captain Jack has a total of 9 parrots in his crew.

Given information:
- Liam initially had 8 piano keys.
- Liam added 3 more piano keys later in the day.

Step 1: Find the number of piano keys Liam has after adding 3 more.
Number of piano keys after adding 3 more = Initial number of piano keys + Number of piano keys added

* Initially, Liam had 8 piano keys
* He added 3 more piano keys, so he had 8 + 3 = 11 piano keys

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this problem with the updated information.

Given information:
- Initially, Jimmy had 9 ice-creams.
- He bought 6 more ice-creams.
- He was given 3 more ice-creams.

Step 1: Find the number of ice-creams Jimmy had after buying 6 more.
Initial number of ice-creams + Number of ice-creams bought = Number of ice-creams after buying
9 + 6 = 15 ice-creams

Step 2: Find the total number of ice-creams Jimmy has now after being given 3 more.
Number of ice-creams after buying + Number of ice-creams given = Total number of ice-creams now
15 + 3 = 18 ice-creams

Therefore, with the updated information, Jimmy would have 18 ice-creams after buying 6 more and being given 3 more.

To find the number of songs Sam has not listened to, we need to subtract the number of songs he has listened to from the total number of songs on the album.

Step 1: Find the number of songs Sam has not listened to.
Number of songs not listened to = Total number of songs - Number of songs listened to
Number of songs not listened to = 15 - 13
Number of songs not listened to = 2

Therefore, if Sam had originally listened to 13 songs from the album, he would have not listened to 2 songs from the album.

Given information:
- The wizard initially creates 12 magical orbs with the first spell.
- The wizard then conjures 8 more orbs with the second spell.

To find the total number of magical orbs, we need to add the number of orbs created by the first spell and the number of orbs created by the second spell.

Total number of magical orbs = Number of orbs from the first spell + Number of orbs from the second spell
Total number of magical orbs = 12 + 8
Total number of magical orbs = 20

He gave 8 figurines to his best friend.
So, he was left with 13 - 8 = 5 figurines.

Now, he decides to give one more figurine to his best friend.
This means he will have one less figurine than before.

To find the number of figurines he has left:
Number of figurines left after giving one more = Initial number of figurines left - 1
Number of figurines left after giving one more = 5 - 1
Number of figurines left after giving one more = 4

Therefore, after giving one more dinosaur figurine to his best friend, the dinosaur enthusiast has 4 dinosaur figurines left.

Given information:
- Farmer Bob harvested 7 potatoes in the morning.
- Farmer Bob found an additional 9 potatoes in the afternoon.
- Farmer Bob had to give 10 potatoes to his neighbor.

Step 1: Find the total number of potatoes Farmer Bob harvested.
Total potatoes harvested = Potatoes harvested in the morning + Potatoes found in the afternoon
Total potatoes harvested = 7 + 9 = 16 potatoes

Step 2: Subtract the number of potatoes given to the neighbor from the total potatoes harvested.
Potatoes left = Total potatoes harvested - Potatoes given to the neighbor
Potatoes left = 16 - 10 = 6 potatoes

- Farmer Bob gave 10 potatoes to his neighbor.
- Farmer Bob found another patch of potatoes and harvested 14 more.

Step 1: Find the number of potatoes Farmer Bob had left after giving 10 potatoes to his neighbor.
Potatoes left after giving to the neighbor = Total potatoes harvested - Potatoes given to the neighbor
Potatoes left after giving to the neighbor = 16 - 10 = 6 potatoes

Step 2: Add the 14 potatoes harvested from the additional patch to the potatoes left.
Total potatoes now = Potatoes left after giving to the neighbor + Potatoes harvested from the additional patch
Total potatoes now = 6 + 14 = 20 potatoes

Therefore, Farmer Bob now has 20 potatoes after finding the additional patch and harvesting 14 more potatoes.

- Alexa ate 6 cherries from the cake.
- Alexa added 8 more cherries to the cake.

Step 1: Find the number of cherries remaining on the cake after Alexa ate 6 cherries.
Number of cherries remaining = Initial number of cherries - Number of cherries eaten
Number of cherries remaining = 15 - 6 = 9 cherries

Step 2: Find the total number of cherries on the cake after adding 8 more cherries.
Total number of cherries on the cake = Number of cherries remaining + Number of cherries added
Total number of cherries on the cake = 9 + 8 = 17 cherries

Therefore, there are now 17 cherries on the cake.

- Alexa ate 6 cherries from the cake.
- Alexa added 8 more cherries to the cake, making it 17 cherries.
- Alexa added 2 more cherries to the cake.

To find the total number of cherries on the cake now, we need to add the 2 additional cherries to the previous total.

Step 1: Find the total number of cherries on the cake after adding 2 more cherries.
Total number of cherries on the cake = Previous total + Number of cherries added
Total number of cherries on the cake = 17 + 2 = 19 cherries

Therefore, there are now 19 cherries on the cake in total.

Given information:
- The zookeeper had 12 lions in the first section before the new arrivals.
- The zookeeper had 8 lions in the second section before the new arrivals.

To find the total number of lions the zookeeper had before the new arrivals, we need to add the number of lions in the two sections.

Step 1: Add the number of lions in the two sections.
Number of lions in the first section + Number of lions in the second section = Total number of lions before the new arrivals
12 + 8 = 20

Therefore, the zookeeper had a total of 20 lions before the two new lions arrived.

Given information:
- The team consists of 9 firefighters.

Step 1: Find the number of firefighters still on their way.
Number of firefighters still on their way = Total number of firefighters - Number of firefighters at the site
Number of firefighters still on their way = 9 - 6
Number of firefighters still on their way = 3

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* Initially, there were 9 firefighters in the team
* 6 firefighters managed to get to the site immediately
* So, 9 - 6 = 3 firefighters were still on their way
* Now, 5 additional firefighters from another station were dispatched

To find the total number of firefighters on their way now, we need to add the initial number of firefighters on their way and the additional firefighters dispatched.

Total firefighters on their way now = Initial firefighters on their way + Additional firefighters dispatched
Total firefighters on their way now = 3 + 5
Total firefighters on their way now = 8

Therefore, after 5 additional firefighters were dispatched, there are now 8 firefighters on their way to the site.

Step 1: Find the number of times Carter wants to swing on the blue swing.
Number of times on the blue swing = 6

Step 2: Find the number of times Carter wants to swing on the red swing.
Number of times on the red swing = 12

Step 3: Find the total number of times Carter wants to swing by adding the number of times on both swings.
Total number of times Carter wants to swing = Number of times on the blue swing + Number of times on the red swing

Step 1: Subtract the number of rooms on the ground floor from the total number of rooms in the house.
Number of rooms above the ground floor = Total number of rooms - Number of rooms on the ground floor

To find the number of rooms above the ground floor or in the basement, we need to subtract the number of rooms on the ground floor from the total number of rooms, including the basement.

Step 1: Subtract the number of rooms on the ground floor from the total number of rooms, including the basement.
Number of rooms above the ground floor or in the basement = Total number of rooms (including basement) - Number of rooms on the ground floor
Number of rooms above the ground floor or in the basement = 18 - 5
Number of rooms above the ground floor or in the basement = 13

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* Initially, Mark had written:
    - 3 letters to his parents
    - 8 letters to his friends
* So the total number of letters he had written was 3 + 8 = 11

* Now, he remembers one more friend to whom he wants to write a letter.
* So he will write one additional letter.

To find the new total number of letters:
* Previous total number of letters = 11
* Additional letters written = 1
* New total number of letters = Previous total + Additional letters
* New total number of letters = 11 + 1 = 12

Therefore, after including the letter to the additional friend, Mark has written a total of 12 letters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's revisit the problem with the new information.

Given information:
- Mark wrote 3 letters to his parents.
- Mark wrote 2 letters to his friends.

To find the total number of letters, we need to add the number of letters written to his parents and the number of letters written to his friends.

Total number of letters = Number of letters to parents + Number of letters to friends
Total number of letters = 3 + 2
Total number of letters = 5

Therefore, with the new information, Mark would have written a total of 5 letters.

Given information:
- Tina has 1 apple initially.
- Tina finds 6 more apples under the apple tree.

To find the total number of apples Tina has, we need to add the number of apples she initially had with the number of apples she found under the tree.

Step 1: Find the total number of apples Tina has.
Number of apples Tina initially had + Number of apples she found under the tree = Total number of apples

Number of carrots left = 16 - 10
Number of carrots left = 6

Therefore, if Peter had given 10 carrots to his pet rabbit instead of 2, he would have 6 carrots left.

Given information:
- The shop opens at 13:00 (1 PM).
- We need to find the time 5 hours after the opening time.

Step 1: Convert the opening time to a 24-hour format.
13:00 (1 PM) = 13:00

Step 2: Add 5 hours to the opening time.
13:00 + 5 hours = 18:00

Step 3: Convert the result back to the 12-hour format.
18:00 = 6:00 PM

Therefore, 5 hours after the shop opens at 13:00 (1 PM), the time on the clock will be 6:00 PM.

Given information:
- The shop opens at 13:00 (1 PM).
- The shop is supposed to stay open for 5 hours.
- The shop closes one hour before the time it is supposed to.

Step 1: Find the time when the shop is supposed to close.
Opening time + Supposed open duration = Supposed closing time
13:00 + 5 hours = 18:00

Step 2: Subtract one hour from the supposed closing time to find the actual closing time.
Supposed closing time - 1 hour = Actual closing time
18:00 - 1 hour = 17:00

Therefore, if the shop opens at 13:00 (1 PM) and is supposed to stay open for 5 hours, but closes one hour before the time it is supposed to, the shop will actually close at 17:00 (5 PM).

* Initially, Janet had 8 crayons
* She gave 3 crayons to Anna
* So she had 8 - 3 = 5 crayons left
* Then she found 2 more crayons in her bag

To find the total number of crayons Janet has now, we need to add the number of crayons she had left (5) to the number of crayons she found (2).

* 5 crayons left + 2 crayons found = 7 crayons

Therefore, Janet now has a total of 7 crayons.

To find the new total, we need to add the previously found carrots to the newly found carrot:

Total carrots found = Previously found carrots + Newly found carrot
Total carrots found = 6 + 1
Total carrots found = 7

Number of clowns who left = 3 + 3 = 6 clowns

Step 2: Find the number of clowns left at the circus.
Number of clowns left = Total number of clowns - Number of clowns who left
Number of clowns left = 14 - 6 = 8 clowns

Therefore, if 3 plus 3 clowns decided to leave the circus, 8 clowns would have been left at the circus.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 18 shapes in the geometry box.

- Arya decides to remove 8 more shapes.

To find the number of shapes remaining, we need to subtract the total number of shapes removed from the initial number of shapes.

Number of shapes remaining = Initial number of shapes - Total number of shapes removed
Number of shapes remaining = 18 - (1 + 8)

Given:
- The baby T-Rex has 6 teeth after one week.
- An adult T-Rex has 11 teeth on average.

To calculate the number of additional teeth needed, we need to subtract the number of teeth the baby T-Rex currently has from the number of teeth an adult T-Rex has.

Step 1: Find the number of teeth an adult T-Rex has.
Number of teeth an adult T-Rex has = 11 teeth

Step 2: Find the number of additional teeth the baby T-Rex needs to grow.
Number of additional teeth needed = Number of teeth an adult T-Rex has - Number of teeth the baby T-Rex currently has
Number of additional teeth needed = 11 teeth - 6 teeth
Number of additional teeth needed = 5 teeth

Therefore, the baby T-Rex needs to grow 5 more teeth to have the same number of teeth as an adult T-Rex.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the number of beach balls David initially had with the number of beach balls he bought from the store.

Given information:
- David has 15 beach balls initially.
- David buys 4 more beach balls from the store.

Step 1: Find the total number of beach balls David has after buying the additional 4 beach balls.
Total number of beach balls = Initial number of beach balls + Number of beach balls bought
Total number of beach balls = 15 + 4
Total number of beach balls = 19

Therefore, David has a total of 19 beach balls now.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* Initially, David had 15 beach balls
* He bought 4 more beach balls, so he had 15 + 4 = 19 beach balls
* Then, he gave 3 beach balls to his friends

To find out how many beach balls he has left, we need to subtract the number of beach balls he gave away from the total number of beach balls he had after buying the new ones.

* Total beach balls after buying: 19
* Beach balls given away: 3
* Beach balls left = 19 - 3 = 16

Therefore, David has 16 beach balls left now.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Suppose initially, instead of 15, David had 11 beach balls. If he then buys 4 more from the store, how many beach balls would David have in total in this new scenario?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this new scenario.

Given information:
- David initially has 11 beach balls.
- David buys 4 more beach balls from the store.

To find the total number of beach balls David has after buying the additional 4 beach balls, we need to add the initial number of beach balls to the number of beach balls bought.

Step 1: Find the total number of beach balls David has after buying the additional 4 beach balls.
Total number of beach balls = Initial number of beach balls + Number of beach balls bought
Total number of beach balls = 11 + 4
Total number of beach balls = 15

Therefore, in this new scenario where David initially had 11 beach balls and then bought 4 more from the store, he would have a total of 15 beach balls.
