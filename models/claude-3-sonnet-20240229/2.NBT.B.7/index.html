            In one month, a fireplace company sold 278 traditional wood-burning fireplaces. In the same month, they also sold 305 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones. How many gas fireplaces did the company sell?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of gas fireplaces sold by the company.

Given information:
- The company sold 278 traditional wood-burning fireplaces.
- The company sold 305 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones.

Let's represent the number of gas fireplaces sold as x.

Since the company sold 305 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones, we can write the equation:
x = 278 + 305

Solving for x:
x = 278 + 305
x = 583

Therefore, the company sold 583 gas fireplaces.

### Answer: 583</pre>

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we found that the company sold:
- 278 traditional wood-burning fireplaces
- 583 gas fireplaces

To find the total number of fireplaces sold in one month, we need to add the number of traditional wood-burning fireplaces and the number of gas fireplaces.

Total number of fireplaces sold = Number of traditional wood-burning fireplaces + Number of gas fireplaces
Total number of fireplaces sold = 278 + 583
Total number of fireplaces sold = 861

Therefore, the company sold a total of 861 fireplaces in one month.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's revise the scenario with the new information.

Given information:
- The company sold 278 traditional wood-burning fireplaces.
- The company sold 68 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones.

Let's represent the number of gas fireplaces sold as x.

Since the company sold 68 more gas fireplaces than traditional ones, we can write the equation:
x = 278 + 68

Solving for x:
x = 278 + 68
x = 346

Therefore, in the revised scenario, the company sold 346 gas fireplaces.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cameras the photographer has after buying the additional 342 cameras.

Given information:
- The photographer initially had 548 cameras.
- The photographer bought 342 more cameras after visiting a photography exhibition.

To find the total number of cameras, we need to add the initial number of cameras and the number of cameras bought.

Total number of cameras = Initial number of cameras + Number of cameras bought
Total number of cameras = 548 + 342
Total number of cameras = 890

Therefore, the photographer now has 890 cameras in their collection.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of alien creatures that moved to another planet from the initial number of alien creatures on planet Nebula.

Given information:
- There are 792 alien creatures on planet Nebula initially.

Step 1: Subtract the number of alien creatures that moved to another planet from the initial number of alien creatures on planet Nebula.
Number of alien creatures left on planet Nebula = Initial number of alien creatures - Number of alien creatures that moved
Number of alien creatures left on planet Nebula = 792 - 437

- 437 alien creatures moved out of planet Nebula.
- 291 alien creatures immigrated to planet Nebula from a neighboring galaxy.

Step 1: Find the number of alien creatures left on planet Nebula after the group of 437 aliens moved out.
Number of alien creatures left on planet Nebula = Initial number of alien creatures - Number of alien creatures that moved out
Number of alien creatures left on planet Nebula = 792 - 437 = 355

Step 2: Add the number of alien creatures that immigrated from the neighboring galaxy to the number of alien creatures left on planet Nebula.
Number of alien creatures on planet Nebula now = Number of alien creatures left on planet Nebula + Number of alien creatures that immigrated
Number of alien creatures on planet Nebula now = 355 + 291 = 646

- 437 alien creatures decide to move to another planet.

Step 1: Subtract the number of alien creatures that moved to another planet from the initial number of alien creatures on planet Nebula.
Number of alien creatures left on planet Nebula = Initial number of alien creatures - Number of alien creatures that moved
Number of alien creatures left on planet Nebula = 550 - 437

- The goal for next year is 788 rocket launches.

Step 1: Find the number of rockets launched this year.
Number of rockets launched this year = Number of rockets launched last year + Increase in the number of rocket launches
Number of rockets launched this year = 383 + 188
Number of rockets launched this year = 571

Step 2: Find the number of additional rockets needed to be launched next year to reach the goal.
Additional rockets needed next year = Goal for next year - Number of rockets launched this year

Given information:
- The first treasure chest contained 250 rare coins.
- The second treasure chest contained 285 more coins than the first treasure chest.

Step 1: Find the number of coins in the second treasure chest.
Number of coins in the second treasure chest = Number of coins in the first treasure chest + 285
Number of coins in the second treasure chest = 250 + 285
Number of coins in the second treasure chest = 535

- The captain spent 13 doubloons to repair the ship.

To find the number of doubloons left in the treasure chest after the captain spent 13 doubloons for repairs, we need to subtract 13 from the remaining doubloons after the raid.

Step 1: Calculate the number of doubloons left after the captain spent 13 doubloons for repairs.
Number of doubloons left = Remaining doubloons after the raid - Doubloons spent for repairs
Number of doubloons left = 135 - 13
Number of doubloons left = 122

Therefore, after the captain spent 13 doubloons for repairs, there are 122 doubloons left in the treasure chest.

Given:
- Amount of red paint left after painting = 116 milliliters (from the previous problem)

Since we need to use the same amount of blue paint as the remaining red paint, the amount of blue paint used for mixing will be equal to the amount of red paint left, which is 116 milliliters.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of blue paint left after mixing.
Amount of blue paint left = Initial amount of blue paint - Amount of blue paint used for mixing
Amount of blue paint left = 831 milliliters - 116 milliliters
Amount of blue paint left = 715 milliliters

Given information:
- In one area of the rainforest, there are 108 Golden monkeys.
- In another area of the same rainforest, there are 848 more Golden monkeys than in the first area.

Step 1: Find the number of Golden monkeys in the second area.
Number of Golden monkeys in the second area = Number of Golden monkeys in the first area + 848
Number of Golden monkeys in the second area = 108 + 848
Number of Golden monkeys in the second area = 956

Step 2: Find the total number of Golden monkeys in both areas combined.
Total number of Golden monkeys = Number of Golden monkeys in the first area + Number of Golden monkeys in the second area
Total number of Golden monkeys = 108 + 956
Total number of Golden monkeys = 1064

Therefore, there are 1064 Golden monkeys in both areas of the forest combined.

Given information:
- Jonathan flew 307 kites.
- Isabella flew 643 kites plus an additional number of kites equal to the number Jonathan flew.

Step 1: Find the additional number of kites Isabella flew.
Additional number of kites Isabella flew = Number of kites Jonathan flew
Additional number of kites Isabella flew = 307 kites

Step 2: Find the total number of kites Isabella flew.
Total number of kites Isabella flew = Number of kites Isabella initially flew + Additional number of kites Isabella flew
Total number of kites Isabella flew = 643 + 307

Given information:
- Isabella flew a total of 950 kites in the kite festival.
- Isabella decided to return the same number of kites that Jonathan had flown, which was 307 kites.

Step 1: Find the number of kites Isabella had left after returning the borrowed kites.
Number of kites Isabella had left = Total number of kites Isabella flew - Number of kites Isabella returned

Step 1: Find the additional number of kites Isabella flew.
Additional number of kites Isabella flew = Number of kites Jonathan flew
Additional number of kites Isabella flew = 307 kites

Step 2: Find the total number of kites Isabella flew.
Total number of kites Isabella flew = Number of kites Isabella initially flew + Additional number of kites Isabella flew

Step 1: Find the number of beats the drummer played in the original solo.
Number of beats played in the original solo = Total number of beats in the original solo - Number of missed beats
Number of beats played in the original solo = 379 - 39 = 340

Step 2: Find the number of additional beats the drummer added to his performance.
Number of additional beats = Total number of beats played in the current performance - Number of beats played in the original solo

- This month, they sold 57 more skateboards than last month.

Step 1: Find the number of skateboards sold this month.
Number of skateboards sold this month = Number of skateboards sold last month + Increase in sales
Number of skateboards sold this month = 360 + 57
Number of skateboards sold this month = 417

Step 2: Find the number of skateboards remaining in stock after this month's sales.
Number of skateboards remaining in stock = Total skateboards stocked this month - Number of skateboards sold this month

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money John had left in his wallet in the evening.
Amount of money in the morning - Amount of money spent = Amount of money left in the evening
$671 - $411 = $260

- The company produced 25 special edition golden cars.

Step 1: Find the total number of red and blue toy cars.
Number of red toy cars + Number of blue toy cars = Total number of red and blue toy cars
306 + 259 = 565 red and blue toy cars

Step 2: Find the total number of toy cars by adding the golden cars.
Total number of red and blue toy cars + Number of golden cars = Total number of toy cars
565 + 25 = 590 toy cars

Therefore, the company produced a total of 590 toy cars.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's take the previous total and add the 22 limited edition silver toy cars.

Previous total number of toy cars produced:
* 306 red toy cars
* 259 blue toy cars
* 25 golden toy cars
* Total = 306 + 259 + 25 = 590 toy cars

Now, we add the 22 limited edition silver toy cars:
* Total number of toy cars = 590 + 22 = 612 toy cars

Therefore, after manufacturing the additional 22 limited edition silver toy cars, the total number of toy cars produced by the company is 612.

Given information:
- The company produced 306 red toy cars.
- The company produced 371 blue toy cars (updated information).
- The company produced 25 special edition golden cars.

Step 1: Find the total number of red and blue toy cars.
Number of red toy cars + Number of blue toy cars = Total number of red and blue toy cars
306 + 371 = 677 red and blue toy cars

Step 2: Find the total number of toy cars by adding the golden cars.
Total number of red and blue toy cars + Number of golden cars = Total number of toy cars
677 + 25 = 702 toy cars

Step 1: Find the number of cameras sold during the holiday sale.
Number of cameras sold = 414 cameras

Step 2: Find the number of cameras left in the store after the sale.
Number of cameras left = Initial stock - Number of cameras sold
Number of cameras left = 528 - 414

To find the total number of pieces of wood collected, we need to add the number of pieces collected during the day and the additional pieces found later.

Step 1: Add the number of pieces collected during the day and the additional pieces found later.
Total pieces of wood collected = Pieces collected during the day + Additional pieces found later
Total pieces of wood collected = 328 + 479

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of potatoes the farmer has left after selling 297 good potatoes to the local restaurant.

Given information:
- The farmer had 469 potatoes that were fit for sale.
- The farmer sold 297 of the good potatoes to a local restaurant.

Step 1: Find the number of potatoes the farmer has left after selling 297 good potatoes.
Number of potatoes left = Number of potatoes fit for sale - Number of potatoes sold
Number of potatoes left = 469 - 297
Number of potatoes left = 172

Therefore, the farmer has 172 potatoes left to sell.

Given information:
- Planet Xoox initially had 558 known alien species.
- 66 incorrectly categorized species were removed from the total count.
- 120 new species were discovered on an uncharted planet.

Step 1: Find the number of species after removing the incorrectly categorized species.
Initial number of species - Number of incorrectly categorized species = Number of species after removal
558 - 66 = 492 species

Step 2: Add the newly discovered species to the number of species after removal.
Number of species after removal + Number of newly discovered species = Updated total number of known alien species

Given information:
- Planet Xoox originally had 567 known alien species (not 558).
- 66 incorrectly categorized species were removed from the total count.
- 120 new species were discovered on an uncharted planet.

Step 1: Find the number of species after removing the incorrectly categorized species.
Initial number of species - Number of incorrectly categorized species = Number of species after removal
567 - 66 = 501 species

Step 2: Add the newly discovered species to the number of species after removal.
Number of species after removal + Number of newly discovered species = Updated total number of known alien species
501 + 120 = 621 species

Therefore, if the starting number of known alien species on Planet Xoox was 567, and after a correction of removing 66 species and adding 120 new species, the updated total number of known alien species would be 621.

Step 1: Find the total weight of the sand in the sandbox after adding the new sand.
Total weight of sand = Initial weight of sand + Weight of sand added

* So the total weight after the addition was 604 pounds (336 + 268)
* In the afternoon, they decided to remove the same amount of sand as was initially present, which is 336 pounds

To find the amount of sand left, we need to subtract the amount removed (336 pounds) from the total weight after the morning addition (604 pounds).

Total weight after morning addition: 604 pounds
Amount removed in the afternoon: 336 pounds
Amount of sand left = 604 pounds - 336 pounds

Step 2: Find the total number of butterflies in the sanctuary after the other species arrive.
Total number of butterflies = Number of Monarch butterflies remaining + Number of other species of butterflies that arrived
Total number of butterflies = 229 + 453 = 682

Therefore, after the swarm of Monarch butterflies leaves and other species of butterflies arrive, there are 682 butterflies in the sanctuary.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">In the previous problem, we found that there were 682 butterflies in the sanctuary after the swarm of Monarch butterflies left and 453 other species of butterflies arrived.

Given information:
- There were 682 butterflies in the sanctuary.
- 144 rare species of butterflies are discovered and added to the existing count.

To find the new total number of butterflies in the sanctuary, we need to add the number of rare species of butterflies to the existing count.

Step 1: Add the number of rare species of butterflies to the existing count.
New total number of butterflies = Existing count of butterflies + Number of rare species of butterflies
New total number of butterflies = 682 + 144 = 826

Therefore, after adding the 144 rare species of butterflies to the existing count, there are now 826 butterflies in the sanctuary.

            Keeping the butterflies' sanctuary scenario in mind, let's consider a different situation. Suppose initially there were 961 Monarch butterflies, but this time only 732 left the sanctuary. Then, 197 other species of butterflies arrive. From this, how many butterflies are now in the sanctuary?

Given information:
- Initially, there are 961 Monarch butterflies in the sanctuary.
- 732 Monarch butterflies leave the sanctuary.
- 197 other species of butterflies arrive at the sanctuary.

Step 1: Find the number of Monarch butterflies remaining in the sanctuary after some of them leave.
Number of Monarch butterflies remaining = Initial number of Monarch butterflies - Number of Monarch butterflies that left
Number of Monarch butterflies remaining = 961 - 732 = 229

Step 2: Find the total number of butterflies in the sanctuary after the other species arrive.
Total number of butterflies = Number of Monarch butterflies remaining + Number of other species of butterflies that arrived
Total number of butterflies = 229 + 197 = 426

Therefore, after some Monarch butterflies leave and other species of butterflies arrive, there are 426 butterflies in the sanctuary.

Step 1: Find the total number of hens in the coop after the additional hens are added.
Total hens after adding = Hens in the morning + Additional hens added
Total hens after adding = 293 + 499
Total hens after adding = 792 hens

Step 2: Find the number of hens left in the coop after selling 259 hens.
Hens left in the coop = Total hens after adding - Hens sold

- The chicken farm owner decides to donate 99 hens to a local charity.

Step 1: Find the number of hens left in the coop after donating 99 hens to the local charity.
Hens left in the coop after donation = Hens left in the coop before donation - Hens donated
Hens left in the coop after donation = 533 - 99

Total hens after adding = Hens in the morning + Additional hens added
Total hens after adding = 293 + 365
Total hens after adding = 658 hens

Step 2: Find the number of hens left in the coop after selling 259 hens.

To find the number of additional skirts needed, we need to subtract the current number of skirts from the required number of skirts.

Number of additional skirts needed = Required number of skirts - Current number of skirts

Step 1: Find the energy received on Earth during nighttime every second.
Energy received on Earth during nighttime = Total energy radiated by the sun - Energy not received on Earth during nighttime
Energy received on Earth during nighttime = 752 quintillion joules - 243 quintillion joules

Given information:
- The energy received on Earth during nighttime every second is 509 quintillion joules.
- The Earth needs at least 730 quintillion joules of energy from the sun every second to maintain its current temperature.

To find the energy the Earth is lacking every second during nighttime, we need to subtract the energy received during nighttime from the energy needed to maintain the current temperature.

Step 1: Calculate the energy the Earth is lacking every second during nighttime.
Energy lacking every second during nighttime = Energy needed to maintain current temperature - Energy received during nighttime
Energy lacking every second during nighttime = 730 quintillion joules - 509 quintillion joules
Energy lacking every second during nighttime = 221 quintillion joules

Step 1: Find the energy received on Earth during nighttime every second.
Energy received on Earth during nighttime = Total energy radiated by the sun - Energy not received on Earth during nighttime
Energy received on Earth during nighttime = 752 quintillion joules - 346 quintillion joules
Energy received on Earth during nighttime = 406 quintillion joules

To find the correct total, we need to subtract the overcounted items from the initial count.

Step 1: Calculate the initial total count.
Initial total count = Number of pizzas + Number of burgers
Initial total count = 442 + 516 = 958

Step 2: Subtract the overcounted items from the initial total count.
Correct total count = Initial total count - Overcounted items
Correct total count = 958 - 889 = 69

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of snowballs Sally made by adding the number of smaller snowballs and the number of larger snowballs.

Given information:
- Sally made 573 smaller snowballs for a snowball fight.
- Sally made 259 larger snowballs to build a fort.

Step 1: Find the total number of snowballs Sally made.
Total number of snowballs = Number of smaller snowballs + Number of larger snowballs
Total number of snowballs = 573 + 259
Total number of snowballs = 832

Therefore, Sally made a total of 832 snowballs.

Given information:
- Sally made 573 smaller snowballs for a snowball fight.
- Sally made 259 larger snowballs to build a fort.
- Sally made an additional 7 giant snowballs to serve as the fort's watchtowers.

Step 1: Find the total number of snowballs Sally made initially.
Total number of snowballs initially = Number of smaller snowballs + Number of larger snowballs
Total number of snowballs initially = 573 + 259 = 832

Step 2: Add the number of additional giant snowballs to the initial total.
Total number of snowballs = Total number of snowballs initially + Number of additional giant snowballs
Total number of snowballs = 832 + 7 = 839

Given information:
- The library has 727 books in the children's section.
- There are 309 books on loan to children.
- The librarian wants to have a total of 561 books in the children's section.

Step 1: Find the number of books remaining after the books on loan are returned.
Number of books remaining = Total books - Books on loan
Number of books remaining = 727 - 309 = 418 books

Step 2: Find the difference between the desired number of books and the number of books remaining.
Difference = Desired number of books - Number of books remaining
Difference = 561 - 418 = 143 books

Therefore, the library needs to acquire 143 more books to reach the desired total of 561 books in the children's section.

Given information:
- The company initially had 973 windows in stock.
- After the purchase, they have 597 windows left (same as before).

To find the number of windows bought by the customers, we need to subtract the remaining number of windows from the initial number of windows.

Step 1: Find the number of windows bought by the customers.
Number of windows bought = Initial number of windows - Remaining number of windows
Number of windows bought = 973 - 597
Number of windows bought = 376

Therefore, if the company initially had 973 windows in stock, and after the purchase they had 597 windows left, the customers would have bought 376 windows.

Given information:
- The factory originally produced 761 lamps per day.
- After some machinery issues, the production dropped to 566 lamps per day.
- The reduced production rate lasted for 2 days.

Step 1: Find the difference in lamp production per day.
Original production rate - Reduced production rate = Difference in production per day
761 lamps - 566 lamps = 195 lamps

Step 2: Calculate the total difference in lamp production for 2 days.
Difference in production per day Ã— Number of days = Total difference in production
195 lamps Ã— 2 days = 390 lamps

Therefore, the difference in lamp production if the drop happened for two days is 390 lamps.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the total amount of cheese produced and the amount of cheese lost due to damage and spoilage.

Given information:
- The cheese producer made 841 kilograms of cheese this month.
- The producer lost 40 kilograms of cheese due to damage and spoilage.

Step 1: Find the amount of cheese left after subtracting the lost cheese from the total cheese produced.
Amount of cheese left = Total cheese produced - Amount of cheese lost
Amount of cheese left = 841 kilograms - 40 kilograms
Amount of cheese left = 801 kilograms

Therefore, the cheese producer has 801 kilograms of cheese left.

Given information:
- The cheese producer had 801 kilograms of cheese left after the damage and spoilage.
- The producer had an additional 156 kilograms of cheese in storage.

Step 1: Find the total amount of cheese by adding the cheese left after the damage and spoilage to the additional cheese in storage.
Total amount of cheese = Amount of cheese left after damage and spoilage + Additional cheese in storage
Total amount of cheese = 801 kilograms + 156 kilograms
Total amount of cheese = 957 kilograms

Therefore, the cheese producer has a total of 957 kilograms of cheese now.

Given information:
- The company received an order for 115 residential windows and 240 commercial windows.
- The company received an additional order for 346 more windows.

Step 1: Find the total number of windows from the previous orders.
Total number of windows from previous orders = Number of residential windows + Number of commercial windows
Total number of windows from previous orders = 115 + 240
Total number of windows from previous orders = 355 windows

Step 2: Find the total number of windows ordered by adding the previous orders and the additional order.
Total number of windows ordered = Total number of windows from previous orders + Additional order
Total number of windows ordered = 355 + 346

Given information:
- The company received an order for 518 residential windows.
- The company received an order for 240 commercial windows.

To find the total number of windows ordered, we need to add the number of residential windows and the number of commercial windows.

Step 1: Find the total number of windows ordered.
Total number of windows ordered = Number of residential windows + Number of commercial windows
Total number of windows ordered = 518 + 240
Total number of windows ordered = 758 windows

Therefore, if the company had received an order for 518 residential windows instead of 115, while keeping the same number of 240 commercial windows, the total number of windows ordered would have been 758 windows.

Given information:
- The daily production target is 580 robots.
- During the production issue, the factory produced 531 robots.

Step 1: Find the difference between the daily production target and the actual number of robots produced.
Robots still needed to be produced = Daily production target - Actual robots produced
Robots still needed to be produced = 580 - 531
Robots still needed to be produced = 49

Step 1: Find the difference between the new daily production target and the actual number of robots produced.
Robots still needed to be produced = New daily production target - Actual robots produced

- Mia donated 432 gifts to charity.
- Anna added 415 gifts to the remaining gifts of Mia.

Step 1: Find the number of gifts Mia had after donating to charity.
Number of gifts Mia had after donating = Total gifts received - Gifts donated to charity
Number of gifts Mia had after donating = 961 - 432 = 529 gifts

Step 2: Find the total number of gifts Mia has now by adding the gifts given by Anna.
Total gifts Mia has now = Gifts Mia had after donating + Gifts given by Anna
Total gifts Mia has now = 529 + 415 = 944 gifts

Given information:
- There are 606 hats for adults in the hat shop.
- The hat shop received a new shipment of 90 kids' hats.

To find the total number of hats, we need to add the number of adult hats and the number of kids' hats.

Total number of hats = Number of adult hats + Number of kids' hats
Total number of hats = 606 + 90

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down:
* The hat shop had 786 hats for teens
* They decided to move some of the teen hats to another store
* The number of teen hats they moved is the same as the total number of hats currently in the shop (which we calculated to be 696)

So, to find the number of teen hats left in the shop, we need to subtract the number of hats moved (696) from the original number of teen hats (786).

Number of teen hats left = Original number of teen hats - Number of hats moved
Number of teen hats left = 786 - 696
Number of teen hats left = 90

Therefore, there are 90 teen hats left in the shop after moving the same number of teen hats as the total number of hats currently in the shop.

Total number of hats = Number of adult hats + Number of kids' hats
Total number of hats = 606 + 348

- The nearby factory requests an additional 303 million gallons of water to be processed.

Step 1: Find the total amount of water processed during the day and at night.
Amount of water processed during the day + Amount of water processed at night = Total amount of water processed initially
391 million gallons + 176 million gallons = 567 million gallons

Step 2: Add the additional water requested by the factory to the total amount of water processed initially.
Total amount of water processed initially + Additional water requested by the factory = Total amount of water to be processed

Amount of water processed during the day + Amount of water processed at night = Total amount of water processed
438 million gallons + 176 million gallons = 614 million gallons

Therefore, with the revised daytime figure, the water treatment plant processed a total of 614 million gallons of water.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to subtract the amount of water used from the total capacity of the reservoir.

Given information:
- The capacity of the water reservoir is 927 gallons.
- 133 gallons of water are used.

Step 1: Subtract the amount of water used from the total capacity.
Remaining water in the reservoir = Total capacity - Water used
Remaining water in the reservoir = 927 gallons - 133 gallons
Remaining water in the reservoir = 794 gallons

Therefore, after using 133 gallons of water, there are 794 gallons remaining in the reservoir.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this new problem.

Given information:
- The initial capacity of the water reservoir is 892 gallons.
- 133 gallons of water are used.

To find the remaining water in the reservoir, we need to subtract the amount of water used from the initial capacity.

Step 1: Subtract the amount of water used from the initial capacity.
Remaining water in the reservoir = Initial capacity - Water used
Remaining water in the reservoir = 892 gallons - 133 gallons
Remaining water in the reservoir = 759 gallons

Therefore, if the reservoir started with 892 gallons and 133 gallons were used, there would be 759 gallons remaining in the reservoir.

Given information:
- There are 921 tomato plants growing in the north field.
- The farmer plants another 52 tomato plants in the south field.
- 204 plants are destroyed by pests.

Step 1: Find the total number of tomato plants before the pest damage.
Total number of tomato plants before pest damage = Plants in the north field + Plants in the south field
Total number of tomato plants before pest damage = 921 + 52
Total number of tomato plants before pest damage = 973

Step 2: Find the number of tomato plants remaining after the pest damage.
Number of tomato plants remaining = Total number of tomato plants before pest damage - Number of plants destroyed by pests
Number of tomato plants remaining = 973 - 204
Number of tomato plants remaining = 769

- Billy lent 88 building blocks to his friend Sam.

Step 1: Find the total number of building blocks Billy lent to his friends.
Building blocks lent to John + Building blocks lent to Sam = Total building blocks lent
20 + 88 = 108 building blocks lent

Step 2: Find the number of building blocks Billy has left.
Total building blocks - Total building blocks lent = Building blocks left

To find the number of items she would have left, we need to subtract the number of items given away from the total number of items she had initially.

Step 1: Subtract the number of items given away from the total number of items.
Number of items left = Total number of items - Number of items given away
Number of items left = 467 - 91

Step 2: Calculate the result.
Number of items left = 467 - 91

Step 1: Add the number of apple trees, orange trees, and lemon trees together.
Number of apple trees + Number of orange trees + Number of lemon trees = Total number of trees
311 + 236 + 379 = 926

Step 1: Find the total number of pirouettes the ballerina does in a day.
Total pirouettes in a day = Pirouettes before lunch + Pirouettes after lunch

Given:
- The ballerina did 575 pirouettes before dinner (from the previous problem).
- The total number of pirouettes she did for the day was 314 less than if she had doubled the number of pirouettes she performed before dinner.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of pirouettes the ballerina did after dinner.
- Let y be the total number of pirouettes she did for the day.

Step 1: Express the total number of pirouettes for the day in terms of x.
y = 575 + x

Step 2: Express the condition that the total number of pirouettes for the day was 314 less than if she had doubled the number of pirouettes she performed before dinner.
y = 2 Ã— 575 - 314
y = 1150 - 314
y = 836

Step 3: Substitute the expression for y in the equation from Step 1.
836 = 575 + x

Step 4: Solve for x.
x = 836 - 575
x = 261

Step 1: Find the total number of pirouettes the ballerina did in a day.
Total pirouettes in a day = Pirouettes before lunch + Pirouettes after lunch

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the new total number of planes handled by the airport each day after the number of departures has decreased.

Given information:
- Initially, the airport handled 520 departures and 423 arrivals, totaling 943 planes per day.
- Due to fuel shortages, the number of departures has dropped from 520 to 359.
- The number of arrivals remains constant at 423.

Step 1: Find the new total number of planes handled by the airport each day.
New total number of planes handled = New number of departures + Number of arrivals
New total number of planes handled = 359 + 423
New total number of planes handled = 782

Therefore, after the decrease in the number of departures, the airport now handles a total of 782 planes each day.

Given information:
- There are 35 maple trees in the park.
- The number of pine trees is the same as the number of maple trees.

Step 1: Find the number of pine trees.
Number of pine trees = Number of maple trees
Number of pine trees = 35

Step 2: Find the total number of trees in the park.
Total number of trees = Number of maple trees + Number of pine trees

Given information:
- There were initially 70 trees in the park.
- After a heavy storm, 23 trees were uprooted and needed to be removed.

To find the number of trees left in the park after the storm, we need to subtract the number of trees removed from the initial total number of trees.

Step 1: Subtract the number of trees removed from the initial total number of trees.
Number of trees left = Initial total number of trees - Number of trees removed
Number of trees left = 70 - 23
Number of trees left = 47

Step 1: Find the number of pine trees.
Number of pine trees = Number of maple trees
Number of pine trees = 168

Step 2: Find the total number of trees in the park before the storm hit.
Total number of trees before the storm = Number of maple trees + Number of pine trees

Step 1: Find the total number of players who have already joined the server.
Total number of players who have joined = Number of players who joined in the morning + Number of players who joined in the afternoon
Total number of players who have joined = 201 + 620
Total number of players who have joined = 821

Step 2: Find the number of remaining slots available on the server.
Number of remaining slots = Maximum server capacity - Total number of players who have joined

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the remaining backpacks after sending out backpacks to both retailers.

Given information:
- The backpack manufacturer has 903 units in their warehouse inventory initially.
- They send out 203 backpacks to the first local retailer.
- They send out 329 more backpacks to another retailer.

Step 1: Find the remaining backpacks after sending out 203 backpacks to the first retailer.
Initial inventory - Backpacks sent out to the first retailer = Remaining backpacks after the first shipment
903 - 203 = 700 backpacks

Step 2: Find the remaining backpacks after sending out 329 backpacks to the second retailer.
Remaining backpacks after the first shipment - Backpacks sent out to the second retailer = Final remaining backpacks
700 - 329 = 371 backpacks

Therefore, 371 backpacks remain in the warehouse inventory after sending out backpacks to both retailers.

Given information:
- The backpack manufacturer initially had 903 units in their warehouse inventory.
- They send out 331 backpacks to the local retailer.

Step 1: Subtract the number of backpacks sent out from the initial inventory.
Initial inventory - Backpacks sent out = Remaining backpacks in the warehouse

Substituting the given values:

To find the number of watches left after the sale, we need to subtract the number of watches sold from the initial total number of watches.

Now, the TV network decides to double the total number of ads (372).

To find the new total number of ads:
New total number of ads = Original total number of ads Ã— 2

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of telescopes that remained functional after a month.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 682 functional telescopes in the observatory.
- After a month, 391 telescopes were found to be non-functional.

To find the number of telescopes that remained functional, we need to subtract the number of non-functional telescopes from the initial number of functional telescopes.

Number of functional telescopes remaining = Initial number of functional telescopes - Number of non-functional telescopes
Number of functional telescopes remaining = 682 - 391
Number of functional telescopes remaining = 291

Therefore, 291 telescopes remained functional after a month.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 682 functional telescopes in the observatory.
- After a month, 391 telescopes were found to be non-functional.
- After maintenance, 622 non-functional telescopes were repaired and brought back to functionality.

Step 1: Find the number of functional telescopes before the maintenance.
Number of functional telescopes before maintenance = 682 - 391 = 291

Step 2: Find the total number of functional telescopes after the maintenance.
Total number of functional telescopes after maintenance = Number of functional telescopes before maintenance + Number of repaired telescopes
Total number of functional telescopes after maintenance = 291 + 622 = 913

Given information:
- Initially, there were 987 functional telescopes in the observatory.
- After a month, 391 telescopes were found to be non-functional.

To find the number of telescopes that remained functional, we need to subtract the number of non-functional telescopes from the initial number of functional telescopes.

Number of functional telescopes remaining = Initial number of functional telescopes - Number of non-functional telescopes
Number of functional telescopes remaining = 987 - 391
Number of functional telescopes remaining = 596

Therefore, if the observatory initially had 987 functional telescopes and 391 telescopes were found to be non-functional after a month, there would be 596 functional telescopes remaining.

Given information:
- John initially found 52 word repetitions.
- He realized that he made a mistake and counted only half of the actual word repetitions.

Step 1: Find the number of word repetitions John actually counted.
Number of word repetitions John counted = 52

Step 2: Find the actual number of word repetitions in the paragraph.
Since John counted only half of the actual word repetitions, we need to double the number he counted.
Actual number of word repetitions = Number of word repetitions John counted Ã— 2

- John correctly counted 104 word repetitions.

Step 1: Find the total number of word occurrences in the paragraph.
Total number of word occurrences = Number of words in the paragraph + Number of word repetitions
Total number of word occurrences = 318 + 104
Total number of word occurrences = 422

Step 2: Find the number of unique words in the paragraph.
Number of unique words = Total number of word occurrences - Number of word repetitions
Number of unique words = 422 - 104
Number of unique words = 318

- John counted the word repetitions twice to be sure.

Since John counted the word repetitions twice, the new total count of word repetitions in the paragraph is simply twice the actual number of word repetitions.

Step 1: Find the new total count of word repetitions.
New total count of word repetitions = Actual number of word repetitions Ã— 2
New total count of word repetitions = 64 Ã— 2
New total count of word repetitions = 128

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of people at the party initially, and then subtract the number of people who left the party early.

Given information:
- There are 257 adults and 363 children at the party initially.
- 461 people leave the party early.

Step 1: Find the total number of people at the party initially.
Total number of people at the party initially = Number of adults + Number of children
Total number of people at the party initially = 257 + 363
Total number of people at the party initially = 620

Step 2: Find the number of people left at the party after 461 people leave.
Number of people left at the party = Total number of people at the party initially - Number of people who left
Number of people left at the party = 620 - 461
Number of people left at the party = 159

Therefore, 159 people are left at the party after 461 people leave early.

Given information:
- There are 144 adults at the party (instead of 257).
- There are still 363 children at the party.

Step 1: Find the total number of people at the party.
Total number of people = Number of adults + Number of children
Total number of people = 144 + 363
Total number of people = 507

Given information:
- The same number of children and adults attended Michael's party as attended Lucy's party.

Since the same number of people attended Michael's party, we can conclude that there were also 214 people at Michael's party.

Step 1: Find the total number of people attending both parties.
Total number of people attending both parties = Number of people at Lucy's party + Number of people at Michael's party
Total number of people attending both parties = 214 + 214
Total number of people attending both parties = 428

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the total number of sightings and the number of sightings that can be explained by known phenomena.

Given information:
- The total number of sightings after the night when the researcher logged 8 additional sightings is 709.
- Out of these 709 sightings, 663 can be explained by known phenomena.

Step 1: Find the number of sightings that remain unexplained.
Number of unexplained sightings = Total number of sightings - Number of sightings explained by known phenomena
Number of unexplained sightings = 709 - 663
Number of unexplained sightings = 46

Therefore, after taking into account the known explanations, 46 potential UFO sightings remain unexplained.

Given information:
- The UFO researcher initially tracked 444 UFO sightings in the Western Hemisphere.
- On one particular night, they observed 8 additional sightings.

To find the total number of sightings after that particular night, we need to add the number of additional sightings to the initial number of sightings tracked.

Step 1: Add the number of additional sightings to the initial number of sightings tracked.
Total number of sightings after that particular night = Initial number of sightings tracked + Number of additional sightings observed
Total number of sightings after that particular night = 444 + 8
Total number of sightings after that particular night = 452

Therefore, after that particular night, the UFO researcher has tracked a total of 452 UFO sightings.

- Astronomers discovered 540 more stars.

To find the total number of stars after eliminating the repeated observations, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of new stars discovered (excluding the repeated observations).
Number of new stars discovered = Total newly discovered stars - Repeated observations
Number of new stars discovered = 540 - 153 = 387

Step 2: Calculate the total number of stars by adding the initial number of stars and the new stars discovered.

            On a farm, there are 178 adult chickens. But this month, an additional 73 chicks hatch. The farm's maximum capacity, though, is 983 chickens. How many more chickens can the farm hold?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the farm's maximum capacity and the current total number of chickens.

Given information:
- There are 178 adult chickens on the farm.
- An additional 73 chicks hatched this month.
- The farm's maximum capacity is 983 chickens.

Step 1: Find the current total number of chickens on the farm.
Current total number of chickens = Number of adult chickens + Number of new chicks
Current total number of chickens = 178 + 73 = 251 chickens

Step 2: Find the remaining capacity of the farm.
Remaining capacity = Farm's maximum capacity - Current total number of chickens
Remaining capacity = 983 - 251 = 732 chickens

Therefore, the farm can hold 732 more chickens.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 435 adult chickens on the farm.
- An additional 73 chicks hatched this month.

To find the total number of chickens, we need to add the number of adult chickens and the number of new chicks.

Total number of chickens = Number of adult chickens + Number of new chicks
Total number of chickens = 435 + 73
Total number of chickens = 508

- Initially, there were 720 trucks parked in the parking lot.
- In the afternoon, 88 more trucks parked in the lot.

To find the total number of trucks parked in the afternoon, we need to add the initial number of trucks and the additional trucks that arrived.

Total number of trucks parked in the afternoon = Initial number of trucks + Additional trucks
Total number of trucks parked in the afternoon = 720 + 88
Total number of trucks parked in the afternoon = 808

- Initially, there were 720 trucks parked in the parking lot.
- In the afternoon, 88 more trucks parked in the lot, making the total number of trucks 808.
- The towing company removed 45 trucks from the parking lot.

To find the number of trucks left in the parking lot, we need to subtract the number of trucks removed by the towing company from the total number of trucks parked in the afternoon.

Number of trucks left in the parking lot = Total number of trucks parked in the afternoon - Number of trucks removed
Number of trucks left in the parking lot = 808 - 45
Number of trucks left in the parking lot = 763

Therefore, after the towing company removed 45 trucks from the parking lot, there are 763 trucks left in the parking lot.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 439 trucks parked in the parking lot (not 720).
- In the afternoon, 88 more trucks parked in the lot.

To find the total number of trucks parked in the afternoon, we need to add the initial number of trucks and the additional trucks that arrived.

Total number of trucks parked in the afternoon = Initial number of trucks + Additional trucks
Total number of trucks parked in the afternoon = 439 + 88
Total number of trucks parked in the afternoon = 527

Therefore, after the update, and before the towing company began their job, there were 527 trucks parked in the parking lot in the afternoon.

Step 1: Find the number of magical sparks that did not disappear into thin air.
Number of magical sparks that did not disappear = Total magical sparks produced - Number of magical sparks that disappeared
Number of magical sparks that did not disappear = 484 - 177

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas Susan picked.
Total bananas picked = Bananas picked in the morning + Bananas picked in the afternoon
Total bananas picked = 671 + 296 = 967

Step 2: Calculate the number of ripe bananas by subtracting the unripe bananas from the total bananas picked.

- The fisherman caught 109 fish in the afternoon.
- The fisherman caught an additional 189 fish in the evening.

Step 1: Find the total number of fish caught in the morning and afternoon.
Number of fish caught in the morning + Number of fish caught in the afternoon = Total fish caught in morning and afternoon
406 + 109 = 515 fish

Step 2: Add the number of fish caught in the evening to the total from the morning and afternoon.
Total fish caught in morning and afternoon + Number of fish caught in the evening = Total fish caught for the entire day

To find the total number of fish caught, we need to add the number of fish caught in the morning and the number of fish caught in the afternoon.

Given information:
- The skateboard store sold 603 skateboards in October.

Step 1: Find the number of skateboards sold in November.
Number of skateboards sold in November = Number of skateboards sold in October - Number of fewer skateboards sold in November

Given information:
- The skateboard store sold 305 skateboards in November.
- After November, two additional skateboards were returned due to defects.

To find the actual number of skateboards sold in November after the returns, we need to subtract the number of returned skateboards from the initial number of skateboards sold.

Step 1: Calculate the actual number of skateboards sold in November after the returns.
Actual number of skateboards sold in November = Initial number of skateboards sold in November - Number of returned skateboards
Actual number of skateboards sold in November = 305 - 2
Actual number of skateboards sold in November = 303

Therefore, after the returns, the skateboard store has actually sold 303 skateboards in November.

* Originally, the store sold 603 skateboards in October
* Originally, the store sold 298 fewer skateboards in November than in October
* So the number of skateboards sold in November was 603 - 298 = 305

* Now, the question states that instead of selling 298 fewer skateboards in November, the store sold 457 fewer skateboards in November
* So we need to subtract 457 from the original October number of 603

Number of skateboards sold in November = 603 - 457
Number of skateboards sold in November = 146

Therefore, if the skateboard store had initially sold 457 fewer skateboards in October instead of 298 fewer, the store would have sold 146 skateboards in November.

Length of the additional rope = 1000 meters - 623 meters
Length of the additional rope = 377 meters

Therefore, the total length of the two ropes is 1000 meters.

            Considering that Jack is a professional mountain climber, he uses 623 meters of his rope on a massive mountain. He then buys an additional rope, ending up with a total length of 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, Jack has to use 675 meters of the combined length of rope in a rescue mission. How much length of rope does Jack have left now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total length of the two ropes and then subtract the length of rope used in the rescue mission.

Given information:
- The length of the first rope is 623 meters.
- The total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope.
- Jack used 675 meters of the combined length of rope in a rescue mission.

Step 1: Find the total length of both ropes.
Total length of both ropes = Length of the first rope + 377 meters
Total length of both ropes = 623 meters + 377 meters
Total length of both ropes = 1000 meters

Step 2: Find the length of rope left after the rescue mission.
Length of rope left = Total length of both ropes - Length of rope used in the rescue mission
Length of rope left = 1000 meters - 675 meters
Length of rope left = 325 meters

Therefore, Jack has 325 meters of rope left after the rescue mission.

            Now, let's change the scenario a bit. Suppose originally, Jack had a shorter rope that was 472 meters long. Like before, he buys an additional rope, making the total length of both ropes 377 meters more than the length of the first rope. What is the total length of the two ropes in this situation?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this new scenario.

Given information:
- The length of the first (original) rope is 472 meters.
- The total length of both ropes is 377 meters more than the length of the first rope.

Step 1: Find the total length of both ropes.
Total length of both ropes = Length of the first rope + 377 meters
Total length of both ropes = 472 meters + 377 meters
Total length of both ropes = 849 meters

Step 2: Find the length of the additional rope.
Length of the additional rope = Total length of both ropes - Length of the first rope
Length of the additional rope = 849 meters - 472 meters
Length of the additional rope = 377 meters

Therefore, in this situation, the total length of the two ropes is 849 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the initial number of kites and the number of kites taken down.

Given information:
- There were 577 kites in the sky at the peak of the kite festival.
- 256 kites were taken down.

Step 1: Subtract the number of kites taken down from the initial number of kites.
Number of kites remaining = Initial number of kites - Number of kites taken down
Number of kites remaining = 577 - 256
Number of kites remaining = 321

Therefore, 321 kites remained in the sky after 256 kites were taken down.

Given information:
- After the festival, 321 kites remained in the sky.

Step 1: Add the number of kites that remained in the sky and the additional kites brought by the organizers.
Total number of kites = Number of kites remaining in the sky + Additional kites brought
Total number of kites = 321 + 316
Total number of kites = 637

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate with the new information.

Given information:
- There were 855 kites in the sky at the peak of the kite festival.
- 256 kites were taken down.

Step 1: Subtract the number of kites taken down from the initial number of kites.
Number of kites remaining = Initial number of kites - Number of kites taken down
Number of kites remaining = 855 - 256
Number of kites remaining = 599

Therefore, with the updated initial number of 855 kites, and after 256 kites were taken down, 599 kites would have remained in the sky.
