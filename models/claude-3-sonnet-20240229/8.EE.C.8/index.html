            Let's find the values of variables q and s by solving the following system of equations:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method or the elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 4 to eliminate the variable s.

3(40s - 91q = 37) â‡’ 120s - 273q = 111
4(30s + 12q = 121) â‡’ 120s + 48q = 484

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate s.

(120s - 273q = 111) - (120s + 48q = 484)
-321q = -373

Step 3: Solve for q.
q = -373/-321
q = 1.16 (approximately)

Step 4: Substitute the value of q into either of the original equations to find s.
Let's use the first equation: (40s) - (91 Ã— 1.16) = 37
40s - 105.56 = 37
40s = 142.56
s = 142.56/40
s = 3.564 (approximately)

Therefore, the values of the variables are:
q â‰ˆ 1.16
s â‰ˆ 3.564

            Solve the following system of equations for the values of b and m: 4 * b + 44 * m = 180

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the given system of equations for the values of b and m, we can use the elimination method or the substitution method.

Using the elimination method:

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 79 and the second equation by 44 to eliminate the variable m.
4 * b * 79 + 44 * m * 79 = 180 * 79
316 * b + 3476 * m = 14220

79 * m * 44 - 6 * b * 44 = 48 * 44
3476 * m - 264 * b = 2112

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate m.
316 * b + 3476 * m - (3476 * m - 264 * b) = 14220 - 2112
316 * b - 264 * b = 12108
52 * b = 12108
b = 12108 / 52
b = 232.8461538461538

Step 3: Substitute the value of b into either of the original equations to find the value of m.
Using the first equation: 4 * 232.8461538461538 + 44 * m = 180
931.3846153846154 + 44 * m = 180
44 * m = 180 - 931.3846153846154
44 * m = -751.3846153846154
m = -751.3846153846154 / 44
m = -17.0769666666667

Therefore, the values of b and m are:
b = 232.8461538461538
m = -17.0769666666667

Given equations:
42 * o - 15 * g = 28
47 * o + 29 * g = 141

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 29 and the second equation by 15 to eliminate the variable g.
42 * o * 29 - 15 * g * 29 = 28 * 29
1218 * o - 435 * g = 812

47 * o * 15 + 29 * g * 15 = 141 * 15
705 * o + 435 * g = 2115

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate g.
(1218 * o - 435 * g) - (705 * o + 435 * g) = 812 - 2115
513 * o = -1303

Step 3: Solve for o.
o = -1303 / 513
o = -2.54

Step 4: Substitute the value of o into either of the original equations to find the value of g.
Let's use the first equation: 42 * o - 15 * g = 28
42 * (-2.54) - 15 * g = 28
-106.68 - 15 * g = 28
-15 * g = 28 + 106.68
-15 * g = 134.68
g = -8.98

Therefore, the values of o and g are:

(-5)((12v - 6o) = 21)
-60v + 30o = -105

Step 2: Add the second equation to the modified first equation to eliminate v.

Let's use the elimination method:

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate the variable f.
150f + 50g = 276

Step 2: Multiply the second equation by 75 to eliminate the variable f.
150f + 6750g = 10725

Step 3: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate f.

Given equations:
194 = 4y + 14n   (1)
7 = 65n - 79y    (2)

Step 1: Multiply equation (1) by 79 and equation (2) by 4 to eliminate the variable y.
79(194) = 79(4y + 14n)
15326 = 316y + 1106n   (3)

4(7) = 4(65n - 79y)
28 = 260n - 316y   (4)

Step 2: Subtract equation (4) from equation (3) to eliminate y.
15326 - 28 = 1106n - 260n
15298 = 846n

n = 15298/846
n = 18

Step 3: Substitute the value of n into either equation (1) or (2) to find the value of y.
Let's use equation (1):
194 = 4y + 14(18)
194 = 4y + 252
4y = 194 - 252
4y = -58
y = -58/4

Let's use the substitution method.

Step 1: Isolate one variable in one of the equations.
From the second equation, we can isolate l:
6 = 41l - 53g
41l = 6 + 53g
l = (6 + 53g) / 41

Step 2: Substitute the expression for l into the first equation.
146 = 28g + 26((6 + 53g) / 41)
146 = 28g + (156 + 1378g) / 41
146 Ã— 41 = 28g Ã— 41 + 156 + 1378g
5986 = 1148g + 156 + 1378g
5830 = 2526g
g = 5830 / 2526
g = 2.31 (approximately)

Step 3: Substitute the value of g into either equation to find l.
Let's use the second equation:
6 = 41l - 53(2.31)
6 = 41l - 122.43
41l = 128.43
l = 128.43 / 41

89(20p + 56y = 90)
1780p + 1984y = 8010

-20(89p + 7y = 98)
-1780p - 140y = -1960

Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate p.
1984y + (-140y) = 8010 + (-1960)

Using the substitution method:

Step 1: Isolate one variable in one of the equations.
From the first equation, we can isolate d:
72k - 22d = 17
22d = 72k - 17
d = (72k - 17) / 22

Step 2: Substitute the expression for d into the second equation.
6d + 69k = 96
6((72k - 17) / 22) + 69k = 96
(432k - 102) / 22 + 69k = 96
432k - 102 + 1518k = 2112
1950k = 2214
k = 2214 / 1950
k = 1.135384615 (rounded to 9 decimal places)

Step 3: Substitute the value of k into either equation to find d.
Using the first equation:
72(1.135384615) - 22d = 17
81.94615 - 22d = 17
22d = 64.94615
d = 64.94615 / 22
d = 2.952098864 (rounded to 9 decimal places)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the given system of equations, we can use the elimination method or the substitution method. Let's use the elimination method.

Given equations:
73h - 33d = 48
10d + 14h = 91

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 10 and the second equation by 73 to eliminate the variable h.
730h - 330d = 480
730d + 1022h = 6643

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate h.
730h - 330d = 480
-(730d + 1022h = 6643)
-----------------
-1060d = -6163

Step 3: Divide both sides by -1060 to find the value of d.
d = 6163/1060
d = 5.81

Step 4: Substitute the value of d into either of the original equations to find the value of h.
Let's use the first equation: 73h - 33(5.81) = 48
73h - 191.73 = 48
73h = 239.73
h = 239.73/73
h = 3.28

Therefore, the values of d and h are:
d = 5.81
h = 3.28

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the given system of equations for the values of q and e, we can use the elimination method or the substitution method. Let's use the elimination method.

Given equations:
1) 43q - 44e = 29
2) 30q + 43e = 130

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 30 and the second equation by (-43) to eliminate the variable e.
30(43q - 44e = 29)
1290q - 1320e = 870

-43(30q + 43e = 130)
-1290q - 1849e = -5590

Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate e.
1290q - 1320e = 870
-1290q - 1849e = -5590
----------
-529e = -4720

Step 3: Solve for e by dividing both sides by -529.
e = 4720 / 529
e = 8.92 (approximately)

Step 4: Substitute the value of e into either of the original equations to find q.
Let's use the first equation: 43q - 44(8.92) = 29
43q - 393.68 = 29
43q = 422.68
q = 422.68 / 43
q = 9.83 (approximately)

Therefore, the values of q and e that satisfy the given system of equations are:

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 89 to eliminate the variable r.

53 Ã— 6 = 318 = (534 Ã— r) - (444 Ã— a)
109 Ã— 89 = 9701 = (3293 Ã— a) + (534 Ã— r)

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate r.

318 - 9701 = -9383 = (534 Ã— r) - (444 Ã— a) - (3293 Ã— a) - (534 Ã— r)
-9383 = -3737 Ã— a

Step 3: Solve for a.

a = -9383 / -3737
a = 2.51

Step 4: Substitute the value of a into either of the original equations to find r.

Let's use the second equation: 109 = (37 Ã— a) + (6 Ã— r)
109 = (37 Ã— 2.51) + (6 Ã— r)
109 = 92.87 + 6r
6r = 109 - 92.87

Given equations:
1. 42g + 12q = 169
2. 12q - 50g = 19

Step 1: Rearrange the second equation to isolate 'q'.
12q - 50g = 19
12q = 50g + 19
q = (50g + 19) / 12

Step 2: Substitute the expression for 'q' into the first equation.
42g + 12((50g + 19) / 12) = 169
42g + 50g + 19 = 169
92g = 150
g = 150 / 92
g = 25 / 18

Step 3: Substitute the value of 'g' into the expression for 'q' to find 'q'.
q = (50(25/18) + 19) / 12
q = (1250/18 + 19) / 12

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 62 and the second equation by 11 to eliminate the variable v.

2294 * s - 682 * v = 3348

82 * s - 62 * v = 41 (Multiply by 11)
902 * s - 682 * v = 451

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate v.

2294 * s - 682 * v = 3348
- (902 * s - 682 * v = 451)

1392 * s = 2897

Step 3: Divide both sides by 1392 to find the value of s.

s = 2897 / 1392
s = 2.08

Step 4: Substitute the value of s into either of the original equations to find the value of v.

Let's use the first equation: 37 * s - 11 * v = 54
37 * 2.08 - 11 * v = 54

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve for the values of c and z, we need to use the system of linear equations given.

Let's start by rearranging the equations to get them in the standard form:

41c + 65z = 151
78z - 48c = 48

Now, we can use the elimination method to solve for c and z.

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 48 and the second equation by 41 to eliminate c.
41c Ã— 48 + 65z Ã— 48 = 151 Ã— 48
1968c + 3120z = 7248

78z Ã— 41 - 48c Ã— 41 = 48 Ã— 41
3198z - 1968c = 1968

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate c.
(1968c + 3120z) - (3198z - 1968c) = 7248 - 1968
3888c = 5280
c = 5280/3888
c = 1.36 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 3: Substitute the value of c into either of the original equations to find z.
Let's use the first equation: 41(1.36) + 65z = 151
56.16 + 65z = 151
65z = 151 - 56.16
65z = 94.84

99v - 3034e = -3979

Since the coefficient of e is -3034, we can set it to 0 by dividing both sides by -3034.
99v - 3034e = -3979
99v = -3979 + 3034(0)
99v = -3979
v = -3979/99
v = -40.19

Step 3: Substitute the value of v into either of the original equations to find e.

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 26 and the second equation by 25 to eliminate the variable 'v'.
26(25v + 69d) = 2938
25(26d + 42v) = 2125

650v + 1794d = 2938
650d + 1050v = 2125

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation:

d = 813/744
d = 1.092... â‰ˆ 1.09

Step 2: Substitute the value of 'd' into either of the original equations to find the value of 'v'.

Substituting d = 1.09 into the first equation:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the system of equations for g and z, we can use the elimination method or the substitution method. Let's use the elimination method.

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 91 to eliminate the variable z.
3(43z - 91g = 33) â‡’ 129z - 273g = 99
91(72g - 3z = 68) â‡’ 6552g - 273z = 6188

Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate z.
129z - 273g = 99
6552g - 273z = 6188
-----------------
6279g = 6287

Step 3: Solve for g.
6279g = 6287
g = 6287/6279
g â‰ˆ 1

Step 4: Substitute the value of g into either of the original equations to find z.
Let's use the second equation: 72g - 3z = 68
72(1) - 3z = 68
72 - 3z = 68

            Alex's and Brad's baskets contained c cherries and f figs respectively. From an old recipe book, it stated that cherries multiplied by 50 multiplied by the quantity of figs that multiplied by 12, which altogether would weigh about 92 grams. Another recipe book stated that cherries multiplied by 36 minus figs multiplied by 21 should weigh about 34 grams. Can you find the quantity of cherries (c) and figs (f)? Use the following system of equations to solve:

50c + 12f = 92
36c - 21f = 34.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method or the elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 3 to eliminate the variable c.
150c + 36f = 276

Step 2: Multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate the variable c.
72c - 42f = 68

Step 3: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate c.
150c + 36f = 276
- (72c - 42f = 68)
------------------
78f = 208

Step 4: Solve for f.
f = 208/78
f = 2.67 (approximately)

Step 5: Substitute the value of f into either equation to find c.
Let's use the first equation: 50c + 12(2.67) = 92
50c + 32.04 = 92
50c = 92 - 32.04
50c = 59.96
c = 59.96/50
c = 1.199 (approximately)

Therefore, the quantity of cherries (c) is approximately 1.199, and the quantity of figs (f) is approximately 2.67.

1) 87u - 75d = 7
2) 85d - 82u = 54

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 82 and the second equation by 87 to eliminate u.
(87u - 75d) Ã— 82 = 7 Ã— 82
7134u - 6150d = 574

(85d - 82u) Ã— 87 = 54 Ã— 87

Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate u.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the system of two linear equations with two unknowns (a and i) and find their values.

Given equations:
(75 * a) - (4 * i) = 42
(10 * i) + (13 * a) = 160

Step 1: Rearrange the first equation to get i in terms of a.
(75 * a) - (4 * i) = 42
-4i = 42 - (75 * a)
i = (75a - 42) / 4

Step 2: Substitute the expression for i into the second equation.
(10 * i) + (13 * a) = 160
10 * ((75a - 42) / 4) + 13a = 160
(187.5a - 105) + 13a = 160
200.5a = 265
a = 265 / 200.5
a = 1.32

Step 3: Substitute the value of a into the expression for i to find the value of i.
i = (75a - 42) / 4
i = (75 * 1.32 - 42) / 4
i = (99 - 42) / 4
i = 57 / 4
i = 14.25

Therefore, the values of a and i are:

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 18 and the second equation by 37 to eliminate p.
18(37p + 74c = 183)
666p + 1332c = 3294

37(27c - 18p = 13)
999c - 666p = 481

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate p.
(1332c - 999c) = (3294 - 481)
333c = 2813

Step 3: Solve for c.
c = 2813 / 333
c = 8.45 (approximately)

Step 4: Substitute the value of c into either of the original equations to find p.

48z + 1968y = 2304 (Second equation Ã— 24)

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate z.
48z + 144y = 278
- (48z + 1968y = 2304)
--------------
-1824y = -2026

Step 3: Solve for y.
-1824y = -2026
y = -2026/-1824
y = 1.11

Step 4: Substitute the value of y into either of the original equations to find z.
Let's use the second equation: 2z + 82y = 96
Substitute y = 1.11
2z + 82(1.11) = 96
2z + 91.02 = 96
2z = 96 - 91.02
2z = 4.98
z = 4.98/2
z = 2.49

Therefore, the values of y and z are:
y = 1.11
z = 2.49

Given equations:
(87 * o) - (29 * v) = 1

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 8 and the second equation by 29 to eliminate the variable v.
8 Ã— [(87 * o) - (29 * v) = 1]
696o - 232v = 8

29 Ã— [(8 * v) + (30 * o) = 91]

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate v.
696o - 232v = 8
-(232v + 870o = 2639)
--------------
-174o = -2631

Step 3: Solve for o.
-174o = -2631
o = 2631/174

24d + 78f = 651

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 78 to find the value of f.
f = 651/78
f = 8.346... â‰ˆ 8 (since we are dealing with integers)

Step 4: Substitute the value of f into either of the original equations to find the value of d.

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by (-66) and the second equation by 42 to eliminate the variable 'm'.

Step 3: Divide both sides by -5814 to find the value of 'r'.

r = -6534/-5814
r = 1.124 (approximately)

Step 4: Substitute the value of 'r' into either of the original equations to find the value of 'm'.

918s - 432p = 252
--------------
750s = 756

Step 3: Solve for s.
s = 756 / 750
s = 1

Step 4: Substitute the value of s into either of the original equations to find p.
Let's use the first equation: (18p - 7(1)) = 21
18p - 7 = 21
18p = 28
p = 28/18
p = 7/4

Therefore, the values of p and s that satisfy both equations are:
p = 7/4

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the given system of equations, we can use the elimination method or the substitution method. Let's use the elimination method.

Given equations:
59c - 34w = 84 (Equation 1)
11c + 42w = 98 (Equation 2)

Step 1: Multiply Equation 1 by 11 and Equation 2 by 59 to eliminate the variable c.
649c - 374w = 924 (11 Ã— Equation 1)
649c + 2478w = 5782 (59 Ã— Equation 2)

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate c.
-2852w = -4858
w = 4858 / 2852
w = 1.7

Step 3: Substitute the value of w into either of the original equations to find c.
Let's use Equation 1: 59c - 34(1.7) = 84
59c - 57.8 = 84
59c = 141.8
c = 141.8 / 59

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by (-42) and the second equation by 45 to eliminate the variable f.
(-42)(45f + 42z = 101)
-1890f - 1764z = -4242

45(60z - 42f = 13)

Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate f.
-1764z = -4242

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the given system of equations, we can use the substitution method or the elimination method. Let's use the substitution method.

Given equations:
31 = 58l - n
103 = n + 73l

Step 1: Express one variable in terms of the other variable from one of the equations.
From the first equation, we can express n in terms of l.
n = 58l - 31

Step 2: Substitute the expression for n into the second equation.
103 = n + 73l
103 = (58l - 31) + 73l
103 = 131l - 31

Step 3: Solve for l by rearranging the terms.
131l - 31 = 103
131l = 134
l = 134/131
l â‰ˆ 1.023

Step 4: Substitute the value of l into either of the original equations to find n.
Let's use the first equation: 31 = 58l - n
31 = 58(1.023) - n
31 = 59.334 - n
n = 59.334 - 31
n = 28.334

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:
l â‰ˆ 1.023
n â‰ˆ 28.334

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 25 and the second equation by 29 to eliminate the variable y.
25(29y - 28j = 39) â‡’ 725y - 700j = 975
29(25y + 37j = 116) â‡’ 725y + 1073j = 3364

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate y.
725y - 700j = 975
-(725y + 1073j = 3364)
-----------------
-1773j = -2389

Step 3: Divide both sides by -1773 to find the value of j.
j = 2389/1773
j = 1.347 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Step 4: Substitute the value of j into either of the original equations to find the value of y.
Let's use the first equation: 29y - 28(1.347) = 39
29y - 37.716 = 39
29y = 76.716
y = 76.716/29
y = 2.645 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

-85(96u + 17a = 186) â‡’ -8160u - 1445a = -15810

Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate 'a'.
(1581u - 1445a = 1258) + (-8160u - 1445a = -15810)
-6579u = -14552

Step 3: Solve for 'u'.

u = -14552/-6579
u = 2.21

Step 4: Substitute the value of 'u' into either of the original equations to find 'a'.
Let's use the first equation: 93u - 85a = 74

Given equations:
(17 * r) + (67 * b) = 103 (1)
(85 * r) + (67 * b) = 187 (2)

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by (-5) to eliminate the variable b.
(-5) Ã— (17 * r + 67 * b = 103)
-85 * r - 335 * b = -515

Step 2: Add the resulting equation from Step 1 to the second equation to eliminate the variable b.
(85 * r + 67 * b = 187) + (-85 * r - 335 * b = -515)
0 * b = -328

Step 3: Solve for r using the second equation.
85 * r + 67 * b = 187
85 * r = 187 - 67 * b
85 * r = 187 (since b = 0)
r = 187 / 85
r = 2.2

Step 4: Substitute the value of r into either equation to find the value of b.
(17 * 2.2) + (67 * b) = 103
37.4 + 67 * b = 103
67 * b = 103 - 37.4

3230n - 2052t = 1558

Let's use the substitution method:

Step 1: Rearrange the first equation to express one variable in terms of the other.
75u - 69q = 5
75u = 5 + 69q
u = (5 + 69q) / 75

Step 2: Substitute the expression for u into the second equation.
48u + 25q = 140
48((5 + 69q) / 75) + 25q = 140
(240 + 3312q) / 75 + 25q = 140
3312q + 1875q = 10500
5187q = 10500
q = 10500 / 5187
q = 2

Step 3: Substitute the value of q into the expression for u to find the value of u.

20((24x) - (49v)) = 440

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x.

7,231 - 440 = 6,791

Given equations:
39t + 41g = 147
94t - 91g = 42

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 94 and the second equation by 39 to eliminate one of the variables (let's eliminate t).
39t Ã— 94 + 41g Ã— 94 = 147 Ã— 94
3666t + 3854g = 13818

94t Ã— 39 - 91g Ã— 39 = 42 Ã— 39
3666t - 3549g = 1638

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate t.
(3854g + 3666t) - (-3549g + 3666t) = 13818 - 1638
7403g = 12180

Step 3: Solve for g by dividing both sides by 7403.
g = 12180 / 7403
g = 1.645 (approximately)

Step 4: Substitute the value of g into either of the original equations to find the value of t.
Let's use the first equation: 39t + 41(1.645) = 147
39t + 67.645 = 147
39t = 147 - 67.645
39t = 79.355

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the elimination method or the substitution method. Let's use the elimination method.

Given equations:
6c + 55o = 112
55c - 48o = 36

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by -48 and the second equation by 6 to eliminate the variable c.
-288c - 2640o = -5376
330c - 288o = 216

Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate c.
42o = -5160

Step 3: Solve for o.
o = -5160/42
o = -122.857142857...
o â‰ˆ -123

Step 4: Substitute the value of o into either of the original equations to find c.
Let's use the first equation: 6c + 55(-123) = 112
6c - 6765 = 112
6c = 6877
c = 1146

Therefore, the values of c and o that satisfy the given system of equations are:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the elimination method or the substitution method. Let's use the elimination method.

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 71 and the second equation by 8 to eliminate the variable w.
8(71)w + 68(71)u = 170(71)
568w + 4828u = 12070

71(8)w - 94(8)u = 8(8)
568w - 752u = 64

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate w.
4828u - (-752u) = 12070 - 64
5580u = 12006

Step 3: Solve for u.
u = 12006 / 5580
u = 2.15

Step 4: Substitute the value of u into either of the original equations to find w.
Let's use the first equation: 8w + 68(2.15) = 170
8w + 146.2 = 170
8w = 23.8
w = 2.975

Therefore, the values that satisfy the system of equations are:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve the given system of equations for the values of r and f, we can use the elimination method or the substitution method. Let's use the elimination method.

Given equations:
68r + 8f = 92 ... (1)
97f + 38r = 182 ... (2)

Step 1: Multiply equation (1) by 97 and equation (2) by 68 to eliminate the variable f.
97 Ã— (68r + 8f = 92)
6556r + 776f = 8884

68 Ã— (97f + 38r = 182)
6596f + 2584r = 12376

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate f.
(6556r + 776f = 8884) - (6596f + 2584r = 12376)
-5820f + 3972r = -3492

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 3972 to find the value of r.
-5820f + 3972r = -3492
r = -3492 / 3972
r = -0.879 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Step 4: Substitute the value of r into either of the original equations to find the value of f.
Let's use equation (1): 68r + 8f = 92
68(-0.879) + 8f = 92
-59.772 + 8f = 92
8f = 92 + 59.772
8f = 151.772
f = 151.772 / 8
f = 18.972 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:
r = -0.879
f = 18.972

For the first equation, consider 67 apples, each worth d dollars, and 37 ragdolls, each worth r dollars. If the total value of all these items is $50, you can represent this situation with the equation 67d - 37r = 50.

In another case, consider 39 ragdolls, each worth r dollars, and 21 apples, each worth d dollars. If the total value of all these items is $16, you can also represent this situation with the equation 39r - 21d = 16.

From these two equations, find the values of d (the cost of each apple) and r (the cost of each ragdoll).

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the system of linear equations and find the values of r and d that satisfy both equations.

Given equations:
67d - 37r = 50
39r - 21d = 16

Step 1: Rearrange the equations to get the standard form (Ax + By = C).
67d - 37r = 50 (Multiply both sides by -1)
-67d + 37r = -50

39r - 21d = 16

Step 2: Use the elimination method to solve for one variable in terms of the other.
Multiply the first equation by 39 and the second equation by 67 to eliminate d.
(-67d + 37r) Ã— 39 = -50 Ã— 39
-2613d + 1443r = -1950

39r - 21d = 16 (Multiply by 67)
2613r - 1407d = 1072

Step 3: Add the two equations to eliminate d.
1443r - 1950 + 2613r - 1072 = 0
4056r = 3022
r = 3022/4056
r = 0.75 (Cost of each ragdoll)

Step 4: Substitute the value of r into either equation to find d.
Let's use the first equation: 67d - 37(0.75) = 50
67d - 27.75 = 50
67d = 77.75
d = 77.75/67
d = 1.16 (Cost of each apple)

Therefore, the cost of each ragdoll (r) is $0.75, and the cost of each apple (d) is $1.16.

Given equations:
163 = 50x + a (First equation)
24 = 98x - 84a (Second equation)

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 98 and the second equation by 50 to eliminate the variable x.
98(163) = 98(50x + a)
15,974 = 4,900x + 98a

50(24) = 50(98x - 84a)
1,200 = 4,900x - 4,200a

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x.
15,974 - 1,200 = 4,900x + 98a - 4,900x + 4,200a
14,774 = 4,298a

Step 3: Solve for a.
a = 14,774 / 4,298
a = 3.44 (approximately)

Step 4: Substitute the value of a into either of the original equations to find x.
Let's use the first equation: 163 = 50x + a

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 44 and the second equation by 67 to eliminate p.
67(67p + 18b) = 4490 + 1206b
82(82b - 44p) = 6724b - 3608p

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate p.

Step 1: Rearrange the equations to get one variable in terms of the other.
From the first equation, we can express e in terms of c.
63c - 36e = 27
36e = 63c - 27
e = (63c - 27) / 36

Step 2: Substitute the expression for e into the second equation.
8c + 32((63c - 27) / 36) = 69
8c + (2016c - 864) / 36 = 69
8c + 56c - 24 = 69
64c = 93
c = 93/64

Step 3: Substitute the value of c into the expression for e to find the value of e.
e = (63c - 27) / 36

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by a suitable constant to make the coefficients of one variable (say, x) the same in both equations.
Multiplying the first equation by 61/26, we get:
61x + (29 Ã— 61/26)p = 107 Ã— 61/26
61x + 67.5p = 2497

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the modified first equation to eliminate the variable x.
(61x + 67.5p = 2497) - (61x - 51p = 4)
118.5p = 2493

Step 3: Solve for p.

Given equations:

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 31 and the second equation by 29 to eliminate the variable g.
31 Ã— [(29 Ã— l) + (17 Ã— g) = 68]
31 Ã— (29 Ã— l) + 31 Ã— (17 Ã— g) = 68 Ã— 31

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the elimination method or the substitution method. Let's use the elimination method.

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate the variable a.
66a - 108c = 40

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the modified first equation.
66a - 108c = 40
-(24a - 26c = 29)
-----------------
42a - 82c = 11

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by -82 to find the value of c.
c = 11/82

Step 4: Substitute the value of c into either of the original equations to find the value of a.
Let's use the first equation: 33a - 54(11/82) = 20
33a - 594/82 = 20
33a = 20 + 594/82
a = (20 + 594/82) / 33
a = 614/82 / 33
a = 614 / 2706
a = 0.227 (approximately)

Therefore, the values are:
a â‰ˆ 0.227
c â‰ˆ -0.134

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve a system of two linear equations with two variables, we can use various methods, such as the substitution method, elimination method, or matrix method. Let's use the elimination method here.

Given equations:
71d + 9j = 132
43j - 84d = 91

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 84 and the second equation by 71 to eliminate the variable d.
71d Ã— 84 + 9j Ã— 84 = 132 Ã— 84
5964d + 756j = 11088

43j Ã— 71 - 84d Ã— 71 = 91 Ã— 71
3053j - 5964d = 6461

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate d.
(5964d + 756j) - (3053j - 5964d) = 11088 - 6461
9817j = 4627

Step 3: Solve for j by dividing both sides by 9817.
j = 4627 / 9817
j = 0.472 (approximately)

Step 4: Substitute the value of j into either of the original equations to find d.
Let's use the first equation: 71d + 9(0.472) = 132
71d + 4.248 = 132
71d = 127.752
d = 1.8 (approximately)

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is:
d â‰ˆ 1.8
j â‰ˆ 0.472

### Answer: d â‰ˆ 1.8, j â‰ˆ 0.472</pre>

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 87 and the second equation by 81 to eliminate the variable n.

(81 Ã— 87 Ã— o) + (26 Ã— 87 Ã— n) = 163 Ã— 87
(87 Ã— 23 Ã— o) + (81 Ã— 87 Ã— n) = 143 Ã— 81

7047o + 2262n = 14191
2001o + 7047n = 11583

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate n.

(7047o + 2262n) - (2001o + 7047n) = 14191 - 11583
5046o - 4785n = 2608

Step 3: Set the coefficient of n to zero by dividing both sides by -4785.

5046o - 4785n = 2608
-4785n = -2608
n = 2608 / 4785
n = 0.545 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Step 4: Substitute the value of n into either of the original equations to find the value of o.

(81 Ã— o) + (26 Ã— 0.545) = 163
81o + 14.17 = 163
81o = 148.83
o = 148.83 / 81
o = 1.838 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

Therefore, the values of o and n are:
o = 1.838
n = 0.545

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 61 and the second equation by 46 to eliminate the variable s.
61(46s - 61w = 2)
2806s - 3721w = 122

46(61s + 67w = 178)
2806s + 3082w = 8168

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate s.
2806s - 3721w = 122
- (2806s + 3082w = 8168)

-6803w = -8046

Step 3: Solve for w.
-6803w = -8046
w = 8046/6803
w = 1.18 (approximately)

Step 4: Substitute the value of w into either of the original equations to find s.

Given equations:
26m + 17l = 146
93m + l = 126

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by (-1) to make the coefficients of l opposite in sign.
-26m - 17l = -146

Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate the variable l.
(-26m - 17l) + (93m + l) = (-146) + 126
67m = -20

Step 3: Divide both sides by 67 to find the value of m.
m = -20/67

Step 4: Substitute the value of m into either of the original equations to find the value of l.
Let's use the second equation: 93m + l = 126
Substituting m = -20/67, we get:
93(-20/67) + l = 126

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 62 and the second equation by 23 to eliminate k.
22b(62) + 23k(62) = 109(62)
1364b + 1426k = 6758

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate k.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we need to use the elimination method or the substitution method.

Let's use the elimination method:

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 51 and the second equation by 6 to eliminate the variable b.

1. (306b) + (255k) = 5355
2. (570k) - (306b) = 402

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate b.

(306b) + (255k) = 5355
-(570k) + (306b) = -402
----------------------------
-315k = 4953

Step 3: Solve for k by dividing both sides by -315.

k = -4953/-315
k = 15.75

Step 4: Substitute the value of k into either of the original equations to find the value of b.

Let's use the first equation: (6b) + (5 * 15.75) = 105
6b + 78.75 = 105
6b = 26.25
b = 4.375

Therefore, the values of b and k are:
b = 4.375
k = 15.75

            Determine the values of d and u from the following pair of simultaneous linear equations:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this pair of simultaneous linear equations, we can use the elimination method or the substitution method. Let's use the elimination method.

Given equations:
33d + 62u = 114
32u + 40d = 83

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 32 and the second equation by 33 to eliminate one of the variables (let's eliminate d).
32(33d + 62u) = 3648
33(32u + 40d) = 2739

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation.
3648 - 2739 = 909
1056u + 1056d - 1320d = 909
1056u - 264d = 909

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of u to find the value of u.
1056u/1056 - 264d/1056 = 909/1056
u - 0.25d = 0.86
u = 0.86 + 0.25d

Step 4: Substitute the value of u into one of the original equations to find the value of d.
Let's use the first equation: 33d + 62u = 114
33d + 62(0.86 + 0.25d) = 114
33d + 53.32 + 15.5d = 114
48.5d = 60.68
d = 60.68/48.5
d = 1.25

Step 5: Substitute the value of d into the expression for u to find the value of u.
u = 0.86 + 0.25(1.25)
u = 0.86 + 0.3125
u = 1.1725

Therefore, the values of d and u are:
d = 1.25
u = 1.1725

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations with two variables (c and p), we can use the elimination method or the substitution method. Let's use the elimination method.

Given equations:
5c + 28p = 102
20c - 67p = 13

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 1 to eliminate the variable c.
20c + 112p = 408
20c - 67p = 13

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate c.
20c + 112p = 408
- (20c - 67p = 13)
---------------
179p = 395

Step 3: Solve for p by dividing both sides by 179.
p = 395 / 179
p = 2.21

Step 4: Substitute the value of p into either of the original equations to find c.
Let's use the first equation: 5c + 28(2.21) = 102
5c + 61.88 = 102
5c = 40.12
c = 8.024

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 76 and the second equation by 58 to eliminate the variable r.
(58r + 12q) Ã— 76 = 4408r + 912q = 11,172
(97q - 76r) Ã— 58 = 5,626q - 4,408r = 4,408

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate r.
4,408r + 912q = 11,172
-(5,626q - 4,408r = 4,408)
--------------
-4,714q = 6,764

Step 3: Solve for q.
-4,714q = 6,764
q = -6,764 / -4,714
q = 1.435 (approximately)

Step 4: Substitute the value of q into either of the original equations to find r.
Let's use the first equation: 58r + 12(1.435) = 147
58r + 17.22 = 147

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate the variable k.
94v - 6k = 20

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the modified first equation.
94v - 6k - (73v + 2k) = 20 - 128
21v - 8k = -108

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by -8 to find the value of k.

Given equations:
(88 * u) - (96 * d) = 12
(27 * u) + (36 * d) = 71

Step 1: Solve for one of the variables, say d, in terms of u from the first equation.
(88 * u) - (96 * d) = 12
-96d = 12 - 88u
d = (12 - 88u) / (-96)
d = (88u - 12) / 96

Step 2: Substitute the expression for d in the second equation.
(27 * u) + (36 * ((88u - 12) / 96)) = 71
27u + (3312u - 432) / 96 = 71
27u + 34.5u - 4.5 = 71
61.5u = 75.5
u = 75.5 / 61.5
u = 1.227272727...

Step 3: Substitute the value of u in the expression for d to find the value of d.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the elimination method or the substitution method. Let's use the elimination method.

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 8 and the second equation by 21 to eliminate the variable d.

21d - 46f = 53 (Multiply by 8)
168d - 368f = 424

8d + 84f = 133 (Multiply by 21)
168d + 1764f = 2793

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate d.

168d - 368f = 424
-(168d + 1764f = 2793)
-----------------
-2132f = -2369

Step 3: Divide both sides by -2132 to find the value of f.

f = -2369/-2132
f = 1.11

Step 4: Substitute the value of f into either of the original equations to find the value of d.

Let's use the first equation: 21d - 46(1.11) = 53
21d - 51.06 = 53
21d = 104.06
d = 4.96

Therefore, the values of d and f are:
d = 4.96
f = 1.11

Let's use the elimination method:

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 66 and the second equation by 74 to eliminate the variable u.
74u Ã— 66 + 11w Ã— 66 = 116 Ã— 66
4884u + 726w = 7656

66u Ã— 74 - 68w Ã— 74 = 21 Ã— 74
4884u - 5032w = 1554

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate u.
(4884u + 726w = 7656) - (4884u - 5032w = 1554)
5758w = 6102

Step 3: Solve for w.
w = 6102 / 5758
w = 1.06 (approximately)

Step 4: Substitute the value of w into either of the original equations to find u.
Let's use the first equation: 74u + 11(1.06) = 116
74u + 11.66 = 116

3572 * f - 1974 * j = 4512

47 * j + 34 * f = 136 (Multiply by 76)
3572 * f + 2572 * j = 10336

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate j.

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate z.

Step 4: Substitute the value of d into either of the original equations to find the value of z.
Let's use the first equation: 42d - 4z = 75

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this system of equations, we can use the substitution method or the elimination method. Let's use the elimination method.

Given equations:
(42 * o) + (24 * a) = 142
(42 * a) + (6 * o) = 75

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 6 and the second equation by 24 to eliminate the variable 'o'.
6 Ã— [(42 * o) + (24 * a) = 142]
252o + 144a = 852

24 Ã— [(42 * a) + (6 * o) = 75]
1008a + 144o = 1800

Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate 'o'.
(252o + 144a = 852) - (1008a + 144o = 1800)
-864a = -948
a = 1.1

Step 3: Substitute the value of 'a' into either of the original equations to find the value of 'o'.
Let's use the second equation: (42 * a) + (6 * o) = 75
(42 * 1.1) + (6 * o) = 75
46.2 + 6o = 75
6o = 28.8
o = 4.8

Therefore, the values of 'a' and 'o' are:
a = 1.1
o = 4.8

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 16 and the second equation by 2 to eliminate the variable p.
39*r - 2*p = 45 (Multiply by 16)
624*r - 32*p = 720

16*p - 84*r = 36 (Multiply by 2)
32*p - 168*r = 72

Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate p.
624*r - 32*p = 720
32*p - 168*r = 72
-----------------
456*r = 792

Step 3: Solve for r.
456*r = 792
r = 792/456
r = 24/16
r = 1.5

Step 4: Substitute the value of r into either of the original equations to find p.
Let's use the first equation: 39*r - 2*p = 45
39(1.5) - 2*p = 45
58.5 - 2*p = 45

Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 8 and the second equation by 23 to eliminate the variable 'd'.
8 Ã— (23d - 52w = 7)
184d - 416w = 56

23 Ã— (64w - 8d = 58)
1472w - 184d = 1334

Step 2: Add the two equations to eliminate 'd'.
184d - 416w = 56

Step 3: Solve for 'w'.
w = 1390 / 1056
w = 1.316037736 (rounded to 9 decimal places)

Step 4: Substitute the value of 'w' into either of the original equations to find 'd'.
Let's use the first equation: (23d) - (52 Ã— 1.316037736) = 7

Given equations:
(71 * z) + (60 * n) = 184 ... (1)

Step 1: Multiply equation (1) by 52 and equation (2) by 71 to eliminate the variable z.
52 Ã— (71 * z + 60 * n = 184)
3692z + 3120n = 9568 ... (3)

71 Ã— (52 * z - 47 * n = 19)
3692z - 3337n = 1349 ... (4)

Step 2: Subtract equation (4) from equation (3) to eliminate z.
(3120n + 3692z) - (-3337n + 3692z) = (9568 - 1349)
6457n = 8219
n = 8219 / 6457
n = 1.273 (approximately)

Step 3: Substitute the value of n into either equation (1) or (2) to find the value of z.
Substituting n = 1.273 in equation (1):
