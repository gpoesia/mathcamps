        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:

Perimeter = 2 Ã— (length + width)

Given information:
- The perimeter of the rectangular swimming pool is 324 meters.
- The length of the pool is 83 meters.

Let's denote the width of the pool as w.

Perimeter = 2 Ã— (length + width)
324 = 2 Ã— (83 + w)
324 = 166 + 2w
158 = 2w
w = 79 meters

Therefore, the width of the pool is 79 meters.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the rectangle is 194 cm.

Let's denote the length of the other side as x.

Perimeter = 2 Ã— (length + width)
194 = 2 Ã— (49 + x)
194 = 98 + 2x

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a square, which is:

Perimeter = 4 Ã— side length

Given information:
- The perimeter of the square is 280 meters.

Step 1: Set up the equation using the given information.
280 = 4 Ã— side length

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find the side length.
side length = 280 / 4
side length = 70 meters

Therefore, the length of the side of the square with a perimeter of 280 meters is 70 meters.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the quadrilateral is 219 cm.
- Two sides have lengths of 37 cm and 98 cm.
- One side has a length of 41 cm.

Let's represent the unknown length of the fourth side as x.

Perimeter = Sum of all four sides
219 cm = 37 cm + 98 cm + 41 cm + x

Rearranging the terms, we get:
219 cm - 37 cm - 98 cm - 41 cm = x
43 cm = x

Therefore, the length of the fourth side of the quadrilateral is 43 cm.

- The longer side measures 71 meters.

Let's denote the shorter side as w.

Step 1: Substitute the given values into the perimeter formula.

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
282 = 142 + 2w

Step 3: Subtract 142 from both sides.
282 - 142 = 2w
140 = 2w

Step 4: Divide both sides by 2 to find the value of w.

w = 70 meters

Therefore, the length of the shorter side of the rectangular garden is 70 meters.

4 Ã— x = 136

Solving for x:
x = 136 / 4
x = 34

Therefore, the length of one side of the square field is 34 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is given by:

Perimeter = 2 Ã— (length + width)

Given information:
- The total perimeter of the rectangle is 236 meters.
- One side of the rectangle is 43 meters.

Let's denote the length of the opposite side as x.

Step 1: Set up the equation using the perimeter formula.
236 = 2 Ã— (43 + x)

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
236 = 86 + 2x

Step 3: Subtract 86 from both sides.
236 - 86 = 2x
150 = 2x

Step 4: Divide both sides by 2 to find x.
x = 150 / 2
x = 75

Therefore, the length of the opposite side of the rectangle is 75 meters.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the quadrilateral is 206 meters.
- Two sides together have a length of 58 meters.
- The other two sides have lengths of 54 meters and 1 meter, respectively.

Step 1: Find the sum of the lengths of the given sides.
Sum of the given sides = 58 meters + 54 meters + 1 meter

Perimeter = 2 Ã— (length + width)

Given information:
- The perimeter of the rectangle is 384 cm.
- One of the shorter sides (width) is 99 cm.

Let's denote the length of the longer side as x.

Step 1: Set up the equation using the perimeter formula.
Perimeter = 2 Ã— (length + width)
384 = 2 Ã— (x + 99)

Step 2: Solve for x.
384 = 2x + 198
2x = 384 - 198
2x = 186
x = 186 / 2
x = 93

Given information:
- The perimeter of the quadrilateral is 255 m.

- The length of the second side is 15 m.
- The length of the third side is 63 m.

Let's denote the length of the fourth side as x.

Perimeter = Sum of the lengths of all four sides
255 m = 78 m + 15 m + 63 m + x

Rearranging the terms, we get:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:

Perimeter = 2 Ã— (length + width)

Given information:
- The perimeter of the rectangle is 242 meters.
- One of the sides (let's assume it's the length) is 97 meters.

Let's denote the unknown side (width) as w.

Perimeter = 2 Ã— (length + width)
242 = 2 Ã— (97 + w)
242 = 194 + 2w
48 = 2w
w = 24 meters

Therefore, the length of the other side (width) of the rectangle is 24 meters.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the square is 268 cm.

Step 1: Define the perimeter of a square.
The perimeter of a square is the total distance around the square, which is equal to four times the length of one side.

Let's represent the length of one side as x.

Perimeter of a square = 4 Ã— x

Step 2: Substitute the given perimeter value into the equation.
268 cm = 4 Ã— x

Step 3: Solve for x by dividing both sides by 4.
x = 268 cm / 4
x = 67 cm

Therefore, the length of each side of the square is 67 cm.

Let's denote the other side (the width) as w.

Substituting the given values into the perimeter formula, we get:

186 = 100 + 2w
2w = 186 - 100

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the fourth side of the quadrilateral using the given information about the perimeter and the lengths of the other three sides.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the quadrilateral is 157 meters.
- One side is 97 meters long.
- Another side is 5 meters long.
- The third side is 30 meters long.

Let's represent the length of the fourth side as x.

According to the definition of perimeter, the sum of all four sides should be equal to the given perimeter.

Perimeter = Sum of all four sides
157 m = 97 m + 5 m + 30 m + x

Rearranging the terms, we get:
x = 157 m - 97 m - 5 m - 30 m
x = 157 m - 132 m

Given information:
- The perimeter of the quadrilateral is 173 meters.
- The lengths of the first, second, and third sides are 46 meters, 50 meters, and 35 meters, respectively.

Let's denote the length of the fourth side as x.

Perimeter of a quadrilateral = Sum of all four sides
173 = 46 + 50 + 35 + x

Rearranging the terms, we get:
173 - 46 - 50 - 35 = x
173 - 131 = x
x = 42 meters

- The lengths of three sides are 92 meters, 29 meters, and 62 meters.
- The sum of the lengths of these three sides is 92 + 29 + 62 = 183 meters.

Since the perimeter is the sum of all four side lengths, we can set up an equation:
Perimeter = Sum of all side lengths
196 = 92 + 29 + 62 + x (where x is the length of the fourth side)

Rearranging the equation, we get:
x = 196 - (92 + 29 + 62)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given information:
- The total perimeter of the rectangular garden is 128 feet.
- One pair of opposite sides is 47 feet each.

Let's denote the length of the remaining two opposite sides as x.

Step 1: Set up the equation using the perimeter formula.
128 = 2(47 + x)

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
128 = 94 + 2x

Step 3: Subtract 94 from both sides.
34 = 2x

Step 4: Divide both sides by 2 to find x.
x = 17

Therefore, the length of the remaining two opposite sides should be 17 feet each.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the quadrilateral is 236 units.
- Two sides of the quadrilateral measure 89 units and 87 units, respectively.
- The third side is 1 unit long.

Let's denote the length of the fourth side as x.

Using the perimeter formula, we can write:
Perimeter = Sum of all four sides
236 = 89 + 87 + 1 + x

Simplifying the equation:
236 = 177 + x
x = 236 - 177
x = 59

166 meters = 19 meters + 19 meters + x + y
166 meters = 38 meters + x + y

Step 2: Rearrange the equation to isolate x and y.
x + y = 166 meters - 38 meters
x + y = 128 meters

Step 3: Since the playground is rectangular, the opposite sides have equal lengths. Therefore, x = y.
x = y

Step 4: Substitute x = y into the equation from Step 2.
x + x = 128 meters
2x = 128 meters
x = 128 meters / 2
x = 64 meters

Therefore, the length of each of the other two sides is 64 meters.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the quadrilateral is 246 meters.
- Two sides have lengths of 40 meters and 32 meters.
- One side has a length of 95 meters.

Let's represent the unknown length of the fourth side as x.

Perimeter = Sum of all four sides
246 = 40 + 32 + 95 + x
246 = 167 + x
x = 246 - 167
x = 79 meters

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the length of one side of a square, given its perimeter, we can use the following steps:

1. The perimeter of a square is the total distance around the square, which is the sum of the lengths of all four sides.
2. Since all sides of a square are equal, we can represent the length of one side as x.
3. The perimeter formula for a square is: Perimeter = 4 Ã— x (since there are four sides of equal length).
4. Given information: The perimeter of the square is 12 meters.
5. Substituting the given value in the formula: 12 = 4 Ã— x
6. Dividing both sides by 4: x = 12 / 4
7. Simplifying: x = 3

Therefore, the length of one side of the square with a perimeter of 12 meters is 3 meters.

Given information:
- The perimeter of the quadrilateral is 160 meters.
- The lengths of three sides are 29 meters, 16 meters, and 41 meters.

Let's represent the unknown length of the fourth side as x.

Perimeter = Sum of all four sides
160 m = 29 m + 16 m + 41 m + x

Rearranging the terms, we get:
x = 160 m - (29 m + 16 m + 41 m)
x = 160 m - 86 m
x = 74 m

Therefore, the length of the fourth side of the quadrilateral is 74 meters.

Let's denote the length of the other side as x.

Perimeter = 2 Ã— (length + width)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the lengths of the other two sides of the rectangle using the given information about the perimeter and the lengths of two sides.

Given information:
- Two sides of the rectangle measure 45 meters each.
- The total perimeter of the rectangle is 210 meters.

Step 1: Find the sum of the lengths of the two known sides.
Sum of the lengths of the two known sides = 45 meters + 45 meters = 90 meters

Step 2: Find the sum of the lengths of the remaining two sides by subtracting the sum of the known sides from the total perimeter.
Sum of the lengths of the remaining two sides = Total perimeter - Sum of the lengths of the known sides
Sum of the lengths of the remaining two sides = 210 meters - 90 meters = 120 meters

Step 3: Since the rectangle has two equal pairs of opposite sides, the lengths of the remaining two sides are equal.
Length of each of the remaining two sides = Sum of the lengths of the remaining two sides / 2
Length of each of the remaining two sides = 120 meters / 2 = 60 meters

Therefore, the length of each of the other two sides of the rectangle is 60 meters.
