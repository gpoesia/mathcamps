        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the product of (29/2) and (19/28), we need to multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:

(29/2) Ã— (19/28) = (29 Ã— 19) / (2 Ã— 28)
                 = 551 / 56

To simplify the fraction 551/56, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 551 and 56, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 551 and 56 is 1.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 551/56.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the product of (29/2) and (19/28):
   (29/2) Ã— (19/28) = (29 Ã— 19) / (2 Ã— 28)
                    = 551 / 56

2. Now, we need to multiply this result by (8/28):
   (551/56) Ã— (8/28) = (551 Ã— 8) / (56 Ã— 28)
                     = 4408 / 1568

3. To simplify the fraction 4408/1568, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 4408 and 1568, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 4408 and 1568 is 8.

4. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 8, we get:
   (4408/8) / (1568/8) = 551 / 196

Therefore, the final simplified fraction is 551/196.

Step 1: Divide 27 by 12
27 Ã· 12 = 2.25

Step 2: Multiply 2.25 by 7
2.25 Ã— 7 = 15.75

Step 3: Convert 15.75 to a fraction
15.75 = 63/4

Therefore, the result of multiplying 7 by the result of dividing 27 by 12 is 63/4.

To check if the fraction can be simplified, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.

The GCF of 63 and 4 is 1.

Since the GCF is 1, the fraction 63/4 cannot be simplified further.

Given information:
- The original recipe calls for 30 parts of flour and 27 parts of water.
- Susan decides to use 29 parts of flour instead.

Step 1: Find the ratio of the new flour amount to the original flour amount.
Ratio = (New flour amount) / (Original flour amount)
Ratio = 29 / 30

Step 2: Multiply the original water amount by the ratio to find the new water amount.
New water amount = (Original water amount) Ã— (Ratio)
New water amount = 27 Ã— (29 / 30)
New water amount = 27 Ã— (29 / 30)
New water amount = (27 Ã— 29) / 30
New water amount = 783 / 30
New water amount = 26.1

Therefore, if Susan uses 29 parts of flour instead of 30 parts, and she keeps the water proportion the same, she will need to use 26.1 parts of water.

(24 / 17) = 24/17 = 8/6 = 4/3

Now, we multiply these two fractions:
(12/11) * (4/3) = (12 * 4) / (11 * 3) = 48 / 33

To simplify the fraction 48/33, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 48 and 33, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The GCD of 48 and 33 is 3.

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:

We need to divide 9 by the fraction 16/6.

To divide a whole number by a fraction, we can multiply the whole number by the reciprocal of the fraction.

The fraction is 16/6.
The reciprocal of 16/6 is 6/16.

So, we have:
9 Ã· (16/6) = 9 Ã— (6/16)

To multiply a whole number by a fraction, we multiply the whole number by the numerator of the fraction and then divide by the denominator.

= (9 Ã— 6) / 16
= 54 / 16
= 27/8

To simplify the fraction 27/8, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.

27/8 = (27/3) / (8/3)

2. Now, we need to multiply (13/7) by (23/2)

To multiply fractions:
Numerator of result = (Numerator of first fraction) * (Numerator of second fraction)
Denominator of result = (Denominator of first fraction) * (Denominator of second fraction)

Numerator of result = 13 * 23 = 299
Denominator of result = 7 * 2 = 14

So, the result is 299/14

To simplify the fraction 299/14:
The greatest common factor (GCF) of 299 and 14 is 1.
Therefore, 299/14 is already in simplest form.

            In the previous problem, you multiplied the fraction 3/7 by the fraction 26/6. Now, let's change the fraction a bit. Instead of 3/7, use 7/7 (which is actually 1). Multiply this new fraction 7/7 by the same fraction 26/6. What is the result of this new calculation, expressed as a simplified fraction?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's multiply the fractions 7/7 and 26/6.

First, we need to note that 7/7 is equal to 1, since any number divided by itself is 1.

So, we are multiplying:
1 x (26/6)

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:
Numerator: 1 x 26 = 26
Denominator: 1 x 6 = 6

Therefore, the product is:
26/6

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 26 and 6, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 26 and 6 is 2.

26/2 = 13
6/2 = 3

Therefore, the simplified fraction is:
13/3

First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 21 and 4, which is 84.

Then, we need to convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 84.

(28/21) = (28 Ã— 4/21 Ã— 4) = (112/84)
(22/4) = (22 Ã— 21/4 Ã— 21) = (462/84)

Now, we can multiply the two fractions:
(112/84) Ã— (462/84) = (112 Ã— 462) / (84 Ã— 84) = 51744 / 7056 = 616 / 84

To simplify the fraction 616/84, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 616 and 84, which is 4.

616/84 = (616/4) / (84/4) = 154/21

1. The total fractional representation of the cargo hauled in one day is 154/21 (from the previous question).

2. We need to calculate (5/24) * (154/21).

3. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 24 and 21, which is 504.

4. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 504:
   (5/24) = (5 Ã— 21/24 Ã— 21) = (105/504)
   (154/21) = (154 Ã— 24/21 Ã— 24) = (3696/504)

5. Now, we can multiply the two fractions:
   (105/504) Ã— (3696/504) = (105 Ã— 3696) / (504 Ã— 504) = 388080 / 254016 = 770 / 504

6. To simplify the fraction 770/504, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 770 and 504, which is 14.

7. 770/504 = (770/14) / (504/14) = 55/36

Therefore, the fraction of the overall cargo that the emergency supply run represents is 55/36.

            After recalculating the cargo hauled in one day with the new total of 29/21 representing the consumer goods, how does this change the overall cargo hauled in one day? If the cargo in the morning now represents 29/21 of its capacity, and the cargo in the afternoon still represents 22/4 of its capacity for industrial supplies, what is the new total fractional representation of these two types of cargo hauled in one day? Calculate ((29 / 21) * (22 / 4)). Write your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to calculate the product of the two fractions (29/21) and (22/4).

First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 21 and 4, which is 84.

Then, we need to convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the denominator 84.

(29/21) = (29 Ã— 4/21 Ã— 4) = (116/84)
(22/4) = (22 Ã— 21/4 Ã— 21) = (462/84)

Now, we can multiply the two fractions:
(116/84) Ã— (462/84) = (116 Ã— 462) / (84 Ã— 84) = 53592 / 7056 = 638 / 84

To simplify the fraction 638/84, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 638 and 84, which is 2.

638/84 = (638/2) / (84/2) = 319/42

Therefore, the new total fractional representation of the two types of cargo hauled in one day is 319/42.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's calculate (10/25) * (20/4) instead.

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:

Numerators: 10 * 20 = 200
Denominators: 25 * 4 = 100

So, (10/25) * (20/4) = 200/100

To simplify the fraction 200/100, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 100.

200/100 = 2
100/100 = 1

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 2/1, which can also be written as 2.

### Answer: 2

The difference between the results of (12/25) * (20/4) and (10/25) * (20/4) is that the first one simplifies to 12/5, while the second one simplifies to 2.</pre>

Given information:
- A full batch of cookies requires 26 cups of sugar.
- The baker has enough sugar to make 29/14 of a full batch.

Step 1: Convert the fraction 29/14 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 26.
29/14 = (29/14) Ã— (26/26)
29/14 = (29 Ã— 26) / (14 Ã— 26)
29/14 = 754 / 364

Step 2: Divide the numerator of the fraction by 26 to find the number of full batches.
Number of full batches = 754 / 26
Number of full batches = 29

Therefore, the baker can make 29 full batches of cookies with the available sugar.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to perform the division operations and simplify the resulting fraction.

Given expression: (28 / 16) / (27 / 24)

Step 1: Simplify the numerator and denominator separately.
28 / 16 = 7 / 4
27 / 24 = 9 / 8

Step 2: Divide the numerators and denominators.
(7 / 4) / (9 / 8) = (7 Ã— 8) / (4 Ã— 9) = 56 / 36 = 14 / 9

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 14/9.

1. We previously found that the result of the expression (28 / 16) / (27 / 24) is 14/9.

2. Now, we need to multiply this result by itself.

(14/9) Ã— (14/9) = (14 Ã— 14) / (9 Ã— 9) = 196 / 81

To simplify the fraction 196/81:
196 = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 7 Ã— 7
81 = 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 3

The greatest common factor of 196 and 81 is 9.
196 / 9 = 22
81 / 9 = 9

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 22/9.

Given information:
- The recipe requires 19/28 of an ingredient.

Step 1: Find the fraction of the recipe they want to make.
30/4 = 7.5

Step 2: Multiply the amount of the ingredient required for the full recipe by the fraction of the recipe they want to make.
(19/28) Ã— 7.5 = (19 Ã— 7.5) / 28

Therefore, the bakery will require 5.09 units of the ingredient to make 30/4 of the recipe.

Given expression: ((5 / 2) / (26 / 15))

Step 1: Evaluate the numerators and denominators separately.
5 / 2 = 2.5
26 / 15 = 1.73333...

Step 2: Divide the numerator by the denominator.
(5 / 2) / (26 / 15) = (2.5) / (1.73333...)

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by converting it to its lowest terms.
1.44 = 144/100

To simplify 144/100, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 144 and 100, which is 4.

144 / 4 = 36
100 / 4 = 25

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 36/25.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We originally had (15/13) * (24/24) = 15/13
2) Now we are asked to consider what would happen if we originally had 15 halves (15/2) instead of 15 thirteenths (15/13)
3) We need to multiply (15/2) by (24/24), which is equal to 1
4) (15/2) * (24/24) = (15 * 24) / (2 * 24) = 360/48 = 15/2
5) The greatest common factor of 15 and 2 is 1, so the simplified fraction is 15/2

(9/7) * (25/30)
= (9 * 25) / (7 * 30)

To simplify the fraction 15/14, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15 and 14, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The GCD of 15 and 14 is 1.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 15/14.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's start with the fraction from the previous problem:
15/14

To multiply it by 15/15, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:

(15/14) * (15/15)
= (15 * 15) / (14 * 15)
= 225 / 210
= 45/42

Now we need to simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 45 and 42, and then dividing the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The GCD of 45 and 42 is 3.

So, 45/42 = (45/3) / (42/3)

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 15/14.

To simplify the fraction 225/147, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 225 and 147, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The GCD of 225 and 147 is 3.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate the expression with the new fraction (15 / 18) instead of (2 / 18).

Given expression: ((20 / 2) * (15 / 18))

Step 1: Evaluate the first fraction (20 / 2)
20 / 2 = 10

Step 2: Evaluate the second fraction (15 / 18)
15 / 18 (This fraction is already in its simplest form)

Step 3: Multiply the two fractions
(10) * (15 / 18) = (10 * 15) / 18 = 150 / 18

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 150 and 18 is 6.
150 / 18 = (150 / 6) / (18 / 6) = 25 / 3

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 25/3.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to multiply the two fractions together.

First, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions, which is the least common multiple of the denominators 9 and 6.

The least common multiple of 9 and 6 is 18.

Next, we need to convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.

11/9 = (11 Ã— 2)/18 = 22/18
29/6 = (29 Ã— 3)/18 = 87/18

Now, we can multiply the numerators and keep the denominator the same:

(22/18) Ã— (87/18) = (22 Ã— 87) / (18 Ã— 18)
                  = 1914 / 324
                  = 5.9 (approximately)

To simplify the fraction 1914/324, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 1914 and 324.

The GCF of 1914 and 324 is 6.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 6, we get:

(1914/6) / (324/6) = 319/54

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 319/54.

1. First, we need to find the result of ((11/9) * (29/6)):
   ((11/9) * (29/6)) = (11 * 29) / (9 * 6)
                     = 319 / 54

2. Now, we need to multiply this result by the fraction (11/5):
   (319/54) * (11/5) = (319 * 11) / (54 * 5)
                     = 3509 / 270

3. To simplify the fraction 3509/270, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 3509 and 270.
   The GCF of 3509 and 270 is 1.

4. Since the GCF is 1, the fraction 3509/270 is already in its simplest form.

Step 1: Find the least common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions.
LCD of 9 and 6 = 18

Step 2: Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD as the denominator.
21/9 = (21 Ã— 2)/18 = 42/18
29/6 = (29 Ã— 3)/18 = 87/18

Step 3: Multiply the numerators and keep the denominator the same.
(42/18) Ã— (87/18) = (42 Ã— 87) / (18 Ã— 18)
                  = 3654 / 324

Step 4: Simplify the fraction 3654/324 by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of 3654 and 324.
The GCF of 3654 and 324 is 6.

Step 5: Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

11/19 * 22/7

To simplify the fraction 242/133, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 242 and 133, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 242 and 133 is 7.

242/7 = 34

(21/30) * (19/5) = (21 * 19) / (30 * 5)
                 = 399 / 150

Now, we need to multiply this result (133/50) by (16/12):
(133/50) * (16/12) = (133 * 16) / (50 * 12)
                   = 2128 / 600
                   = 354 / 100

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To multiply a whole number and a fraction, we can convert the whole number to a fraction with a denominator of 1.

So, 5 = 5/1

Now, we multiply the fractions:
(5/1) Ã— (16/27) = (5 Ã— 16) / (1 Ã— 27)
                = 80 / 27

To simplify the fraction 80/27, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 80 and 27, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 80 and 27 is 8.

80/27 = (80/8) / (27/8)
       = 10 / 3.375

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 10/3.

We need to multiply s by (21/17)

Step 1: Multiply the fractions
s Ã— (21/17) = (9/1) Ã— (21/17)
            = (9 Ã— 21) / (1 Ã— 17)

Given expression: (24 / (12 / 12))

Step 1: Simplify the denominator.
12 / 12 = 1

Step 2: Divide the numerator by the denominator.
24 / 1 = 24

Therefore, the result of the expression (24 / (12 / 12)) is 24.

To write the answer as a simplified fraction, we need to express 24 as a fraction with 1 in the denominator.

24 = 24/1

### Answer: 24/1

In the previous scenario, the answer 's' was 9/1.
In this scenario, where we have 24 items instead of 27, the answer is 24/1.

The effect of this change is that the answer has increased from 9/1 to 24/1. This is because we are dividing a smaller number (24) by the same denominator (1), which results in a larger quotient (24/1) compared to the previous answer (9/1).</pre>

Then, we multiply the denominators:

So, (15/16) * (29/2) = 435/32

To simplify the fraction 435/32, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 435 and 32, and divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 435 and 32 is 3.

Step 4: Simplify the resulting fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, and then dividing both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The GCD of 45 and 11 is 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given:
((18 / 4) * (10 / 11)) = 45/11 (from the previous problem)
(6 / 4)

Step 1: Multiply (45/11) by (6/4)
(45/11) * (6/4) = (45 * 6) / (11 * 4)
                = 270 / 44

Step 2: Simplify the resulting fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, and then dividing both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The GCD of 270 and 44 is 2.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is (270/2) / (44/2) = 135/22.

18 / 1 = 18

Step 2: Evaluate the second fraction (10 / 11)
10 / 11 = 10/11

The previous result was 24/3.

Now, we need to multiply 24/3 by 30/21.

To multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together.

Numerators:
24 Ã— 30 = 720

Denominators:
3 Ã— 21 = 63

Therefore, the product of the two fractions is:
720/63

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 720 and 63, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 720 and 63 is 9.

720/9 = 80
63/9 = 7

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 80/7.

1. Invert the divisor (the second fraction) and multiply it by the dividend (the first fraction).
2. Multiply the numerators together.
3. Multiply the denominators together.
4. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.

Given:
(20/13) / (17/16)

Step 1: Invert the divisor (17/16) to get (16/17).
Step 2: Multiply the numerators: 20 Ã— 16 = 320.
Step 3: Multiply the denominators: 13 Ã— 17 = 221.

Therefore, (20/13) / (17/16) = (320/221)

To simplify the fraction (320/221), we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 320 and 221, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 320 and 221 is 17.
320 Ã· 17 = 18.82352941...

To multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:
(5/15) Ã— (4/1) = (5 Ã— 4) / (15 Ã— 1)
            = 20 / 15

To simplify the fraction 20/15, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 15, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The GCD of 20 and 15 is 5.

30 / 23 = 1.3043... â‰ˆ 1 7/23

Step 2: Simplify the second fraction (19 / 24).
19 / 24 = 0.7916... â‰ˆ 19/24

Step 3: Multiply the two fractions.

26 * 1 = 26

Therefore, the expression (23/26) * (16/1) can be written as:

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 368 and 26, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 368 and 26 is 2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's calculate the expression (2/26) * (16/1) and express the answer as a simplified fraction.

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:
(2/26) * (16/1) = (2 * 16) / (26 * 1)
                = 32 / 26

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 32 and 26, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 32 and 26 is 2.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2, we get:
(32/2) / (26/2) = 16/13

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 16/13.

When dividing fractions, we invert the divisor (the second fraction) and then multiply the two fractions.

So, ((21/1) / (26/20)) can be rewritten as ((21/1) Ã— (20/26)).

Now, we can multiply the numerators and denominators separately:
(21 Ã— 20) / (1 Ã— 26)

First, let's simplify the fractions:
12/2 = 6

Now, we can multiply them:
(6) Ã— (1 3/14) = 6 + (6 Ã— 3/14) = 6 + 18/14 = 6 + 1 4/14 = 7 4/14

To express the answer as a simplified fraction, we need to divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

The GCD of 7 and 14 is 7.

Now, we divide the first fraction by the second:

11/20 = 11/20 * 3/3 = 33/60
24/12 = 24/12 * 5/5 = 120/60

Now we can multiply the fractions:
(33/60) * (120/60) = 3960/3600 = 1980/1800 = 11/10

To simplify the fraction 11/10, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1.

Now, we need to multiply 11/10 by 21/16.

First, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 16, which is 80.

Then, we convert the fractions to have a denominator of 80:
11/10 = 11/10 * 8/8 = 88/80
21/16 = 21/16 * 5/5 = 105/80

Now, we can multiply the fractions:
(88/80) * (105/80) = 9240/6400 = 1155/800

To simplify 1155/800, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 15.

1155/800 = 1155/800 * 1/1 = 77/53

11/6 = 11/6 * 2/2 = 22/12

Now we can multiply the fractions:
(22/12) * (24/12) = 528/144 = 44/12 = 22/6

To simplify the fraction 22/6, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate (12 / 14) * (28 / 5), we need to multiply the fractions:

(12 / 14) * (28 / 5) = (12 * 28) / (14 * 5)
                     = 336 / 70
                     = 48 / 10
                     = 24 / 5

To simplify the fraction 24 / 5 to its lowest terms, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 24 and 5, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The GCD of 24 and 5 is 1.

To write the answer as a simplified fraction:

To simplify 121/100, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 121 and 100, which is 1.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 121/100.

Comparing this to the previous result of 7/5:
* The numerators have changed from 7 to 121

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's multiply the result from the previous calculation (57/16) by the fraction (28/16).

(57/16) * (28/16) = (57 * 28) / (16 * 16)
                  = 1596 / 256
                  = 6.24609375 (decimal form)

To simplify the fraction 1596/256, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 1596 and 256.

The GCF of 1596 and 256 is 4.

Therefore, 1596/256 = (1596/4) / (256/4)

Multiplying the numerators: 29 Ã— 13 = 377

So, the product of the two fractions is 377/120.

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

1. First, we need to multiply 29/5 by 13/24:
   29/5 Ã— 13/24 = (29 Ã— 13) / (5 Ã— 24)
   = 377 / 120
   = 377/120

2. Now, we need to multiply this result (377/120) by 25/11:
   (377/120) Ã— (25/11) = (377 Ã— 25) / (120 Ã— 11)
   = 9425 / 1320

3. To simplify the fraction 9425/1320, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 9425 and 1320, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 9425 and 1320 is 5.

4. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 5, we get:

Multiplying the numerators: 29 Ã— 13 = 377

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To calculate the value of the expression ((29 / 17) / (27 / 22)), we need to first find the values of the individual fractions and then divide them.

29 / 17 = 1.705882352941176...
27 / 22 = 1.227272727272727...

Now, we divide the first fraction by the second fraction:
(29 / 17) / (27 / 22) = (1.705882352941176...) / (1.227272727272727...)
                     = 1.388888888888889...

To express the answer as a simplified fraction, we need to find the numerator and denominator.

The numerator is the decimal value multiplied by the least common multiple of the denominators (17 and 22), which is 374.
Numerator = 1.388888888888889... Ã— 374 = 520

The denominator is the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 374.
Denominator = 374

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To find the product of two fractions, we multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together.

Given fractions:
25/20 and 11/6

Step 1: Multiply the numerators.
25 Ã— 11 = 275

Step 2: Multiply the denominators.
20 Ã— 6 = 120

Step 3: Simplify the resulting fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.

The GCF of 275 and 120 is 5.

275 Ã· 5 = 55
120 Ã· 5 = 24

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 55/24.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

First, we need to find the product of 25/20 and 11/6:
(25/20) Ã— (11/6) = (25 Ã— 11) / (20 Ã— 6)
                 = 275 / 120
                 = 55/24 (simplified)

Now, we need to multiply this result (55/24) by 20/26:
(55/24) Ã— (20/26) = (55 Ã— 20) / (24 Ã— 26)
                   = 1100 / 624

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 1100 and 624, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 1100 and 624 is 4.
1100 Ã· 4 = 275
624 Ã· 4 = 156

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 275/156.

Given:
- Initial fractions: 25/17 and 11/6
- We need to find the product of (25/17 Ã— 11/6) Ã— 20/26

Step 1: Find the product of 25/17 and 11/6
Numerators multiplied: 25 Ã— 11 = 275
Denominators multiplied: 17 Ã— 6 = 102
Product = 275/102

Step 2: Multiply the result from Step 1 by 20/26
Numerators multiplied: 275 Ã— 20 = 5500
Denominators multiplied: 102 Ã— 26 = 2652
Product = 5500/2652

Step 3: Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and dividing both by the GCF.

The GCF of 5500 and 2652 is 4.
5500 Ã· 4 = 1375

1. First, we need to find the value of (7 / 2) / (25 / 10).
   We calculated this in the previous problem, and the value is 7/5.

2. Now, we need to multiply this value (7/5) by (5/3).
   To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:
   (7/5) Ã— (5/3) = (7 Ã— 5) / (5 Ã— 3)
                 = 35 / 15
                 = 7/3

3. To simplify the fraction 7/3, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 7 and 3, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.
   The GCF of 7 and 3 is 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate the expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 11)), we need to perform the following steps:

1. Evaluate the first fraction: 20 / 22 = 10 / 11
2. Evaluate the second fraction: 14 / 11
3. Multiply the two fractions: (10 / 11) * (14 / 11)
4. To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:
   Numerator: 10 * 14 = 140
   Denominator: 11 * 11 = 121
5. Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   The GCD of 140 and 121 is 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 11)):
   (20 / 22) = 10 / 11
   (14 / 11)
   (10 / 11) * (14 / 11) = (10 * 14) / (11 * 11) = 140 / 121

2. Now, we need to multiply the result (140 / 121) by (17 / 3):
   (140 / 121) * (17 / 3) = (140 * 17) / (121 * 3) = 2380 / 363

3. To simplify the fraction 2380 / 363, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2380 and 363, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

   The GCD of 2380 and 363 is 17.
   2380 / 17 = 140
   363 / 17 = 21

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 140 / 21.

            Previously, you evaluated ((20 / 22) * (14 / 11)) and multiplied the result by (17/3). Now consider changing the second fraction in the initial multiplication to (14 / 2). Now how does the expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 2)) differ from the original? Evaluate the new expression and write your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's evaluate the new expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 2)) and compare it to the original expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 11)).

To evaluate the new expression:
1. Evaluate the first fraction: 20 / 22 = 10 / 11
2. Evaluate the second fraction: 14 / 2 = 7
3. Multiply the two fractions: (10 / 11) * 7
4. To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator of the fraction by the whole number:
   Numerator: 10 * 7 = 70
   Denominator: 11
5. Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   The GCD of 70 and 11 is 1.
   Therefore, the simplified fraction is 70 / 11.

The original expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 11)) evaluated to 140 / 121.

The difference between the new expression ((20 / 22) * (14 / 2)) and the original expression is that the second fraction has been changed from (14 / 11) to (14 / 2).

This change results in a larger value for the new expression because (14 / 2) is greater than (14 / 11).

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate ((25 / 8) * (3 / 4)), we first need to calculate 25 / 8 and 3 / 4 separately.

25 / 8 = 3.125
3 / 4 = 0.75

Then, we multiply these two values:
3.125 * 0.75 = 2.34375

To write the result as a simplified fraction, we need to convert the decimal to a fraction.
2.34375 = 2 + 34/100 + 375/100000
= 2 + 34/100 + 3/1000 + 75/100000
= 2 + (34 + 3 + 75/100)/100
= 2 + 112/100
= 2 + 1 + 12/100
= 2 + 1 + 1/8
= 9/4

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 9/4.

This result can signify a form of division or sharing something in portions. For example, if you have 9 objects and you want to divide them equally among 4 people, each person would get 9/4 objects.

Step 3: Simplify the resulting fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, and then dividing both the numerator and denominator by the GCD.

The GCD of 425 and 108 is 17.

425 Ã· 17 = 25
108 Ã· 17 = 6.36 (approximately)

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 25/6.36.

However, since the question asks for a simplified fraction, we can express the denominator as a mixed number:

25/(6 + 0.36) = 25/6 + 25/0.36
= 4 + 1/0.36
= 4 + 2.78 (approximately)

So, t = (9/1) Ã— (2/17) = 18/17

Now, we need to find t Ã— t, which is (18/17) Ã— (18/17).

To multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:

Numerator: 18 Ã— 18 = 324
Denominator: 17 Ã— 17 = 289

Therefore, t Ã— t = (18/17) Ã— (18/17) = 324/289

To simplify the fraction 324/289, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 324 and 289 is 17.

So, the product is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To evaluate the expression ((14/6) / (22/16)), we need to first simplify the fractions 14/6 and 22/16.

14/6 = 7/3 (divide the numerator and denominator by 2)
22/16 = 11/8 (divide the numerator and denominator by 2)

Now, we can divide the two fractions:
(7/3) / (11/8) = (7/3) * (8/11) (dividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal)
= 56/33

To simplify the fraction 56/33, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 56 and 33, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 56 and 33 is 1.

Therefore, the simplified fraction is 56/33.

To multiply 56/33 by 9/4, we can use the following steps:

1. Multiply the numerators: 56 Ã— 9 = 504
2. Multiply the denominators: 33 Ã— 4 = 132
3. Simplify the resulting fraction: 504/132

To simplify 504/132, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 504 and 132, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 504 and 132 is 12.

504/12 = 42

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance traveled and then calculate the amount of petrol consumed based on the given rate of consumption.

Given information:
- The car consumes 16/10 gallons of petrol per mile.
- The route is 13/17 of a mile long.

Step 1: Convert the mixed fraction 16/10 to an improper fraction.
16/10 = (16 Ã— 1 + 0) / 10 = 16/10

Step 2: Convert the mixed fraction 13/17 to an improper fraction.
13/17 = (13 Ã— 1 + 0) / 17 = 13/17

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.
Total distance = 13/17 miles

Step 4: Calculate the amount of petrol consumed.
Amount of petrol consumed = Rate of consumption Ã— Total distance
Amount of petrol consumed = (16/10) Ã— (13/17)
Amount of petrol consumed = (16 Ã— 13) / (10 Ã— 17)
Amount of petrol consumed = 208 / 170
Amount of petrol consumed = 1 8/170 gallons

Step 5: Simplify the fraction 208/170.
208/170 = (208 Ã· 2) / (170 Ã· 2)
208/170 = 104/85

Therefore, the car will have consumed 104/85 gallons of petrol when you finish the drive.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous scenario, you drove a route that was 13/17 miles long. This time, suppose that you have to drive a route that is slightly longer, at 13/7 miles long. If your car still consumes 16/10 gallons of petrol every mile, calculate how many gallons of petrol will the car have consumed when you finish this drive? Express your answer as a simplified fraction.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance traveled and then calculate the amount of petrol consumed based on the given rate of consumption.

Given information:
- The car consumes 16/10 gallons of petrol per mile.
- The route is 13/7 miles long.

Step 1: Convert the mixed fraction 16/10 to an improper fraction.
16/10 = (16 Ã— 1 + 0) / 10 = 16/10

Step 2: Convert the mixed fraction 13/7 to an improper fraction.
13/7 = (13 Ã— 1 + 0) / 7 = 13/7

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.
Total distance = 13/7 miles

Step 4: Calculate the amount of petrol consumed.
Amount of petrol consumed = Rate of consumption Ã— Total distance
Amount of petrol consumed = (16/10) Ã— (13/7)
Amount of petrol consumed = (16 Ã— 13) / (10 Ã— 7)
Amount of petrol consumed = 208 / 70
Amount of petrol consumed = 2 68/70 gallons

Step 5: Simplify the fraction 208/70.
208/70 = (208 Ã· 2) / (70 Ã· 2)
208/70 = 104/35

Therefore, the car will have consumed 104/35 gallons of petrol when you finish the drive.

The steps are as follows:
1) Multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.
2) The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by interchanging the numerator and denominator, and then taking the reciprocal of the new fraction.

Given:
(29/10) / (18/16)

Step 1: Find the reciprocal of (18/16)
Reciprocal of (18/16) = (16/18)

Step 2: Multiply (29/10) by (16/18)
(29/10) Ã— (16/18) = (29 Ã— 16) / (10 Ã— 18)

2) We need to multiply this result by (8/17)

Step 1: Multiply (232/90) by (8/17)
(232/90) Ã— (8/17) = (232 Ã— 8) / (90 Ã— 17)
                  = 1856 / 1530

Step 2: Simplify the fraction 1856/1530
To simplify, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 1856 and 1530, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 1856 and 1530 is 2.

1856/2 = 928

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to multiply the two fractions (15/12) and (27/3).

The process of multiplying fractions is as follows:
1. Multiply the numerators together: 15 Ã— 27 = 405
2. Multiply the denominators together: 12 Ã— 3 = 36
3. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.

So, (15/12) Ã— (27/3) = (405/36)

To simplify the fraction (405/36), we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 405 and 36, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 405 and 36 is 9.
405 Ã· 9 = 45

2. Now, we need to multiply (45/4) by (22/14)

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:
(45/4) Ã— (22/14) = (45 Ã— 22) / (4 Ã— 14)
            = 990 / 56

3. To simplify the fraction 990/56, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 990 and 56, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 990 and 56 is 2.

2. Multiply the denominators: 12 Ã— 5 = 60
3. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.

So, (15/12) Ã— (27/5) = (405/60)

To simplify the fraction (405/60), we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 405 and 60, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCF.

The GCF of 405 and 60 is 15.
