        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's calculate the sum of 35.99 and 48.

Given:
- Number 1: 35.99
- Number 2: 48 (an integer)

To add an integer to a decimal number, we can treat the integer as a whole number and align the decimal points.

Step 1: Align the decimal point of 35.99 with the decimal point of 48 (which is an imaginary decimal point at the end).
   35.99
+  48.00
--------

Step 2: Add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.
   35.99
+  48.00
--------
   83.99

Therefore, the sum of 35.99 and 48 is 83.99.

- Billy wants to buy a book that costs $5.3.

Step 1: Find the total amount of money Billy has after receiving the money from his mom.
Amount in Billy's wallet + Amount given by mom = Total amount
$38.6 + $36.5 = $75.1

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the book from the total amount.

To find the total amount, we need to add the initial amount and the amount added:
* Initial amount: 18.8 gallons
* Amount added: 4 gallons
* Total amount = Initial amount + Amount added
             = 18.8 + 4

To find the total count, we need to add the number of Apples and the number of Oranges together.

Total count = Number of Apples + Number of Oranges
            = 46.5 + 37
            = 83.5

Therefore, the new total count with 46.5 Apples and 37 Oranges is 83.5.

Step 1: Find the remaining amount after spending $90.30 from $99.44.
Remaining amount = Initial amount of money - Amount spent
Remaining amount = $99.44 - $90.30
Remaining amount = $9.14

Step 2: Subtract the remaining amount from the cost of the game console.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the current length of the walking paths and the additional length of the new walking paths.

Given information:
- The current length of the walking paths at the zoo is 12.455 kilometers.
- The zoo plans to add another 30.7 kilometers of walking paths.

Step 1: Add the current length and the additional length.
Current length + Additional length = Total length
12.455 km + 30.7 km = 43.155 km

Therefore, the total length of the walking paths after the addition will be 43.155 kilometers.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total length of the walking paths after adding the additional 25.04 kilometers to the previously calculated total length.

Given information:
- The current length of the walking paths at the zoo is 12.455 kilometers.
- The zoo plans to add 30.7 kilometers of walking paths.
- After adding 30.7 kilometers, the zoo plans to add another 25.04 kilometers of walking paths.

Step 1: Calculate the total length after adding the first 30.7 kilometers.
Current length + First additional length = Total length after first addition
12.455 km + 30.7 km = 43.155 km

Step 2: Calculate the total length after adding the second 25.04 kilometers.
Total length after first addition + Second additional length = Final total length
43.155 km + 25.04 km = 68.195 km

Therefore, the total length of the walking paths after incorporating the additional 25.04 kilometers will be 68.195 kilometers.

Initial length of walking paths at the zoo = 18 kilometers
Additional length of walking paths to be added = 30.7 kilometers

To find the total length of the walking paths after the addition, we need to add the initial length and the additional length.

Total length = Initial length + Additional length
Total length = 18 km + 30.7 km
Total length = 48.7 km

Therefore, if the zoo initially had 18 kilometers of walking paths and they added 30.7 kilometers of new walking paths, the total length of the walking paths would be 48.7 kilometers.

Given information:
- 97.1 is the first number.
- 26 and 11.61 are the numbers whose difference needs to be subtracted from 97.1.

Step 1: Find the difference between 26 and 11.61.
Difference = 26 - 11.61
Difference = 14.39

Step 2: Subtract the difference from 97.1.
97.1 - 14.39 = 82.71

Therefore, if we consider 26 instead of 43.5 in the previous problem, and subtract the difference between 26 and 11.61 from 97.1, we will get 82.71.

Given information:
- The initial weight of one watermelon is 99.2 kg.
- The weight of the watermelon after eating some part of it is 62.1 kg.

Step 1: Find the weight of the eaten part of one watermelon.
Weight of the eaten part = Initial weight - Weight after eating
Weight of the eaten part = 99.2 kg - 62.1 kg
Weight of the eaten part = 37.1 kg

Step 2: Find the total weight of two such eaten watermelons.
Total weight of two eaten watermelons = Weight of the eaten part Ã— 2
Total weight of two eaten watermelons = 37.1 kg Ã— 2
Total weight of two eaten watermelons = 74.2 kg

Given information:
- The total weight of two eaten watermelons is 74.2 kg.
- You further eat 27.9 kg from the combined eaten watermelons.

To find the remaining total weight, we need to subtract the weight of the eaten part (27.9 kg) from the total weight of two eaten watermelons (74.2 kg).

Remaining total weight = Total weight of two eaten watermelons - Weight of the eaten part
Remaining total weight = 74.2 kg - 27.9 kg
Remaining total weight = 46.3 kg

- The weight of each watermelon after eating some part of it is 62.1 kg.

Step 1: Find the weight of the eaten part of one watermelon.
Weight of the eaten part = Initial weight - Weight after eating
Weight of the eaten part = 70 kg - 62.1 kg
Weight of the eaten part = 7.9 kg

Step 2: Find the total weight of two such partially eaten watermelons.
Total weight of two partially eaten watermelons = Weight after eating Ã— 2
Total weight of two partially eaten watermelons = 62.1 kg Ã— 2
Total weight of two partially eaten watermelons = 124.2 kg

Amount of goods left after selling = 54.7 kilograms - 5.6 kilograms
Amount of goods left after selling = 49.1 kilograms

Step 2: Add the additional shipment of 5.0 kilograms to the amount of goods left after selling.
Total amount of goods after receiving the new shipment = Amount of goods left after selling + Additional shipment received
Total amount of goods after receiving the new shipment = 49.1 kilograms + 5.0 kilograms

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the result of 29.4 + 62.318
   29.4
   62.318
   -------
    91.718

2. Now, we need to subtract 77.7 from 91.718
   91.718
   -77.7
   -------

3. We align the decimal points and subtract from right to left:
   Ones column: 8 - 0 = 8
   Tenths column: 1 - 7 = -6 (need to borrow 1 from the hundredths column, making it 11 - 7 = 4)
   Hundredths column: 0 - 7 = -7 (need to borrow 1 from the units column, making it 10 - 7 = 3)
   Units column: 9 - 1 (borrowed) = 8

4. Therefore, the result is 14.018

So, if we subtract 77.7 from the result of 29.4 + 62.318, the new result is:

Given information:
- Initially, there were 26 oranges.
- 7.87 apples were added.

Step 1: Find the total number of fruits by adding the number of oranges and the number of apples.
Number of oranges + Number of apples = Total number of fruits
26 + 7.87 = 33.87

Therefore, the total number of pieces of fruit is 33.87.

We need to add 13.272 to this result.

Step 1: Calculate the sum of 5.5 and 48.937
5.5 + 48.937 = 54.437

Step 2: Add 13.272 to the result from Step 1
54.437 + 13.272 = 67.709

Therefore, if we add 13.272 to the sum of 5.5 and 48.937, which is 54.437, the total would be 67.709.

Step 1: Subtract the cost of the coffee from the initial amount of money John had.
Amount of money John has after buying the coffee = Initial amount of money - Cost of the coffee
Amount of money John has after buying the coffee = $39.583 - $4.74

Step 1: Add the money earned from doing chores to the initial money in his savings account.

Step 2: Add the numbers vertically, column by column, starting from the rightmost column.

   -62.79
   -------
    23.558

2. The question asks us to add this difference (23.558) to itself.
   So, we have:
   23.558 + 23.558 = 47.116

Therefore, if we add the difference between 86.348 and 62.79 (which is 23.558) to itself, we get 47.116.

Given:
- The original number is 86.348
- Instead of subtracting 62.79, we need to subtract 48

To find the difference, we set up the subtraction as follows:

   86.348
  -48.000
  -------

We align the decimal points and subtract the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost column.

   86.348
  -48.000

    38.348

Therefore, if we subtract 48 from 86.348, the new difference is 38.348.
