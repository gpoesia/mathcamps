        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find out how many groups of 5 builders can be formed with the total of 15 builders.

Given information:
- Each castle requires 5 builders.
- There are 15 builders in total.

Step 1: Divide the total number of builders by the number of builders required for each castle.
Number of castles = Total number of builders / Number of builders required per castle

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of hours it took to produce 48 watches, given that the manufacturer can produce 8 watches per hour.

Given information:
- The watch manufacturer can produce 8 watches every hour.
- They have manufactured a total of 48 watches.

Let's represent the number of hours worked as x.

Since they can produce 8 watches per hour, the number of watches produced in x hours is 8x.

We know that the total number of watches produced is 48, so we can set up an equation:

8x = 48

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 8:

x = 48 / 8
x = 6

Therefore, the watch manufacturer worked for 6 hours to produce a total of 48 watches.

Given information:
- The scooter rental shop charges $7 per hour.
- The rider spent $35.

We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the cost, the hourly rate, and the number of hours.

Let x be the number of hours the rider used the scooter.

Cost = Hourly rate × Number of hours
$35 = $7 × x

Dividing both sides by $7, we get:
x = $35 / $7
x = 5 hours

Therefore, the rider used the scooter for 5 hours.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 77 and 11, as the number of bracelets in each collection must be a multiple of both 77 and 11.

We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 77 and 11:

77 = 11 × 7 + 0
11 = 0 × 11 + 11

Therefore, the GCD of 77 and 11 is 11.

Since each collection consists of identical bracelets in distinct multiples of 11, the number of bracelets in each collection must be a multiple of 11.

To find the number of bracelets in each collection, we divide 77 by 11:
77 ÷ 11 = 7

Therefore, there are 7 bracelets in each collection.

Given information:
- Each cup of hot chocolate contains 11 marshmallows.
- The customer found 22 marshmallows in their hot chocolate.

We can set up a proportion to find the number of cups of hot chocolate:

Number of marshmallows in one cup : Number of cups
11 : x

Substituting the given information, we get:
11 : x = 22 : 1

Cross-multiplying, we get:
11 × 1 = 22 × x
11 = 22x
x = 11/22
x = 0.5

Therefore, the customer purchased 0.5 cups of hot chocolate, which is equivalent to 1 cup.

Step 1: Divide the total number of pictures by the maximum capacity of each photo roll.
Number of photo rolls required = Total number of pictures / Maximum capacity of each photo roll
Number of photo rolls required = 60 / 5
Number of photo rolls required = 12

Since we cannot have a fractional part of a photo roll, we need to round up the result to the nearest whole number.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of blankets the company makes in a day, given that they make 35 blankets in a week.

Given information:
- The company can make 35 blankets in a week.
- They make the same number of blankets every day.

Step 1: Find the number of days in a week.
Number of days in a week = 7 days

Step 2: Divide the total number of blankets made in a week by the number of days in a week to find the number of blankets made per day.
Number of blankets made per day = Total number of blankets made in a week / Number of days in a week
Number of blankets made per day = 35 blankets / 7 days
Number of blankets made per day = 5 blankets

Therefore, the company makes 5 blankets in a day.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the quantity of juice in liters for each serving.

Given information:
- The fruit section has 45 liters of freshly squeezed orange juice.
- The quantity of juice yields 5 servings.

We can set up an equation to represent the total quantity of juice in terms of the quantity of each serving.

Let x be the quantity of juice in liters for each serving.

Total quantity of juice = Quantity of juice per serving × Number of servings
45 liters = x × 5

Solving for x:
45 = 5x
x = 45 / 5
x = 9

Therefore, the quantity of juice in liters for each serving is 9 liters.

Given information:
- There are 9 clouds in the sky.
- Each cloud has the exact same weight (w).
- The total weight of all 9 clouds is 9.

Since all the clouds have the same weight, we can represent the total weight as the sum of the weights of individual clouds.

Total weight = Weight of one cloud × Number of clouds
9 = w × 9

Given information:
- When the speed is halved, the train goes at 3 km/hr.

Let's represent the original speed as x km/hr.

Since the given speed (3 km/hr) is half of the original speed, we can write the equation:
x/2 = 3

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
x = 3 × 2
x = 6 km/hr

Therefore, the original speed of the train is 6 km/hr.

- James has a total of 12 toy cars.
- Each type of toy car comes in pairs.

Since each type of toy car comes in pairs, we can divide the total number of toy cars by 2 to find the number of pairs (or types) of toy cars.

Number of pairs (or types) of toy cars = Total number of toy cars / 2
Number of pairs (or types) of toy cars = 12 / 2
Number of pairs (or types) of toy cars = 6

Therefore, James has 6 types of toy cars in his collection.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of gears in the new model of the bicycle by dividing the total number of bicycles by the number of bicycles that can be sold per gear.

Given information:
- Mountain Peak has 63 bicycles ready for sale.
- Each gear of the new model can sell exactly 7 bicycles.

Let's represent the number of gears as x.

Since each gear can sell 7 bicycles, the total number of bicycles that can be sold is 7x.

We know that the total number of bicycles ready for sale is 63.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
7x = 63

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:
x = 63 / 7
x = 9

Therefore, there are 9 gears in the new model of the bicycle.

Given information:
- The compass maker sells 12 compasses each day.
- The total number of compasses sold is 84.

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:
Number of compasses sold per day × Number of days = Total number of compasses sold
12 × Number of days = 84

To find the number of days, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 12:
Number of days = 84 / 12
Number of days = 7

Therefore, it took the compass maker 7 days to sell 84 compasses.

Given information:
- A dolphin can jump 5 times in a single minute.
- A dolphin can jump 60 times in 'p' minutes.

We can represent the relationship between the number of jumps and the number of minutes using a linear equation:

Number of jumps = Rate of jumps per minute × Number of minutes

Substituting the given values, we get:
60 = 5p

To find the value of 'p', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5:
60/5 = 5p/5
p = 12

Therefore, the dolphin jumped for 12 minutes to make 60 jumps.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of pillows and the amount of fabric used.

Given information:
- 3 pillows can be stitched from a certain amount of fabric.
- If the fabric used is divided by 6, it results in the number of pillows that can be made from it.

Let's assume that the amount of fabric used to make 3 pillows is x.

According to the second condition, if we divide x by 6, we get the number of pillows that can be made from it.
x / 6 = 3 (since 3 pillows can be made from x amount of fabric)

Multiplying both sides by 6, we get:
x = 3 × 6

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find how many times the serving size (1/8 pound) goes into the total amount of meat (4 pounds).

Given information:
- The tiger has 4 pounds of meat for his meal.
- One serving size is 1/8 pound.

Step 1: Convert the total amount of meat to the same unit as the serving size.
4 pounds = 4 × 8 × 1/8 pound = 32/8 pound

Step 2: Divide the total amount of meat by the serving size to find the number of servings.
Number of servings = Total amount of meat / Serving size
Number of servings = 32/8 / (1/8)
Number of servings = 32

Therefore, there are 32 servings in the tiger's meal.

Given information:
- The farmer collects 40 strawberries.
- Each friend receives 4 strawberries.

Step 1: Find the total number of strawberries divided among the friends.
Total strawberries divided = 40 strawberries

Step 2: Find the number of friends by dividing the total strawberries by the number of strawberries each friend receives.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cups of hot chocolate sold given the total earnings and the price per cup.

Given information:
- The price of one cup of hot chocolate is $10.
- The total earnings for the day were $70.

We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of cups sold (x) and the total earnings:

Total earnings = Number of cups sold × Price per cup
$70 = x × $10

To find the number of cups sold (x), we need to divide both sides of the equation by $10:

x = $70 / $10
x = 7

Therefore, the hot chocolate booth sold 7 cups of hot chocolate on that day.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of each ring given the total amount received from selling 5 rings.

Given information:
- The jeweler sold 5 rings.
- The total amount received from selling the 5 rings is $35.

Let's assume that the cost of each ring is x dollars.

Since the jeweler sold 5 rings, we can set up an equation:
5x = 35 (where 5x represents the total amount received from selling 5 rings)

To find the value of x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5:
x = 35 / 5
x = 7

Therefore, each ring costs $7.

Given information:
- There are 60 lions in the national park.
- Each region should have exactly 10 lions.

Step 1: Divide the total number of lions by the number of lions in each region.
Number of regions = Total number of lions / Number of lions in each region
Number of regions = 60 / 10
Number of regions = 6

Therefore, the national park authority can distribute the 60 lions into 6 different regions, with each region having exactly 10 lions.

Given information:
- After the discount, each jacket costs $6.
- The discounted price is 1/5th of the original price.

Let's represent the original price as d.

Step 1: Set up the equation.
Discounted price = 1/5 × Original price
6 = (1/5) × d

Step 2: Solve for d.
Multiply both sides by 5 to isolate d.
6 × 5 = (1/5) × d × 5
30 = d

Therefore, the original price of the jacket before the discount was $30.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of giraffes that would consume a total of 28 pounds of food per day, given that each giraffe eats 7 pounds of food per day.

Given information:
- Each giraffe eats 7 pounds of food per day.
- The total amount of food consumed by the giraffes is 28 pounds today.

Let's represent the number of giraffes as x.

Since each giraffe eats 7 pounds of food per day, the total amount of food consumed by x giraffes would be 7x pounds.

We know that the total amount of food consumed is 28 pounds, so we can set up an equation:

7x = 28

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 28 / 7
x = 4

Therefore, there are 4 giraffes in the zoo.
