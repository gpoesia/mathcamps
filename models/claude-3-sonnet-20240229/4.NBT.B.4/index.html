        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of trees cut down from the original number of trees in the forest.

Given information:
- There were originally 5840 trees in the forest.
- 1699 trees were cut down over the course of a year.

Step 1: Subtract the number of trees cut down from the original number of trees.
Number of trees remaining = Original number of trees - Number of trees cut down
Number of trees remaining = 5840 - 1699
Number of trees remaining = 4141

Therefore, there are 4141 trees remaining in the forest now.

Given information:
- There were originally 5840 trees in the forest.
- 1699 trees were cut down over the course of a year.
- After the initial deforestation, 1702 new trees were planted.

Step 1: Find the number of trees remaining after the initial deforestation.
Number of trees remaining after initial deforestation = Original number of trees - Number of trees cut down
Number of trees remaining after initial deforestation = 5840 - 1699 = 4141

Step 2: Add the number of newly planted trees to the number of trees remaining after initial deforestation.
Total number of trees in the forest now = Number of trees remaining after initial deforestation + Number of newly planted trees
Total number of trees in the forest now = 4141 + 1702 = 5843

Therefore, there are 5843 trees in the forest now, combining the existing trees and the newly planted trees.

Given information:
- The forest originally had 6331 trees.

To find the number of trees remaining in the forest, we need to subtract the number of trees cut down from the original number of trees.

Step 1: Subtract the number of trees cut down from the original number of trees.
Number of trees remaining = Original number of trees - Number of trees cut down
Number of trees remaining = 6331 - 1699

Step 1: Subtract the amount of red paint used from the total amount of red paint.
Amount of red paint left = Total amount of red paint - Amount of red paint used

- The company distributed 7730 doors to various stores across the country.

Step 1: Find the total number of doors the company produced.
Total doors produced = Doors made in first factory + Doors made in second factory
Total doors produced = 3706 + 4404
Total doors produced = 8110 doors

Step 2: Find the number of doors left after distribution.
Doors left after distribution = Total doors produced - Doors distributed

Since the regions are mutually exclusive, it means that there is no overlap between the fish species found in each region. Therefore, we can simply add the number of species found in each region to get the total number of different fish species identified.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of different fish species identified in both regions, considering the updated count for the second region.

Given information:
- In one region, there were 1939 different fish species.
- In the second region, the updated count shows 7428 unique species.

Since the regions are mutually exclusive, it means that there is no overlap between the fish species found in each region. Therefore, we can simply add the number of species found in each region to get the total number of different fish species identified.

Total number of different fish species identified = Number of species in region 1 + Number of species in region 2
Total number of different fish species identified = 1939 + 7428
Total number of different fish species identified = 9367

Given information:
- During the morning shift, 2489 cars were produced.
- During the afternoon shift, 4691 cars were produced.

Step 1: Add the number of cars produced during the morning shift and the afternoon shift.
Total cars produced = Cars produced during morning shift + Cars produced during afternoon shift
Total cars produced = 2489 + 4691

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cars produced.

- During the afternoon shift, 4691 cars were produced.
- During the night shift, 1859 cars were produced.

Step 1: Add the number of cars produced during all three shifts.
Total cars produced = Cars produced during morning shift + Cars produced during afternoon shift + Cars produced during night shift
Total cars produced = 2489 + 4691 + 1859

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cars produced.

Given information:
- During the morning shift, 3846 cars were produced (corrected value).

Step 1: Add the number of cars produced during the morning shift and the afternoon shift.
Total cars produced = Cars produced during morning shift + Cars produced during afternoon shift
Total cars produced = 3846 + 4691

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cars produced.
Total cars produced = 3846 + 4691
Total cars produced = 8537 cars

Therefore, with the corrected value for the morning shift, the total number of cars produced during the day shift was 8537 cars.

Step 1: Add the number of gallons of apple juice and orange juice.
Total gallons of juice produced = Gallons of apple juice + Gallons of orange juice

Step 1: Add the gallons of apple juice and orange juice.
Total gallons of juice produced = Gallons of apple juice + Gallons of orange juice

Since twins are double births, we need to subtract twice the number of twins from the total number of babies born to get the number of single-birth babies.

Number of single-birth babies = Total number of babies - (2 Ã— Number of twins)
Number of single-birth babies = 7972 - (2 Ã— 394)

            Let's revisit the initial scenario with a slight change. Suppose initially the train was carrying the same number of 5682 passengers, but this time, only 2281 passengers got off at the stop instead of 5079. Now, how many passengers are left on the train?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's revisit the scenario with the new information.

Given information:
- The train was originally carrying 5682 passengers.
- At a stop, 2281 passengers got off the train.

To find the number of passengers left on the train, we need to subtract the number of passengers who got off from the original number of passengers.

Step 1: Find the number of passengers left on the train.
Number of passengers left on the train = Original number of passengers - Number of passengers who got off
Number of passengers left on the train = 5682 - 2281

Number of passengers left on the train = 5682 - 2281
Number of passengers left on the train = 3401

Therefore, 3401 passengers are left on the train.

Given information:
- The factory produced 4012 tubes of toothpaste in the morning shift.
- The factory produced 882 more tubes of toothpaste in the afternoon shift than in the morning shift.

Step 1: Find the number of tubes of toothpaste produced in the afternoon shift.
Number of tubes produced in the afternoon shift = Number of tubes produced in the morning shift + 882
Number of tubes produced in the afternoon shift = 4012 + 882
Number of tubes produced in the afternoon shift = 4894 tubes

Step 2: Find the total number of tubes of toothpaste produced in a single day.
Total number of tubes produced in a day = Number of tubes produced in the morning shift + Number of tubes produced in the afternoon shift
Total number of tubes produced in a day = 4012 + 4894
Total number of tubes produced in a day = 8906 tubes

Step 1: Add the number of cats the rescue center started with and the number of cats they rescued during the year.
Total number of cats after one year = Number of cats at the start + Number of cats rescued during the year

Step 1: Subtract the number of cats that found homes from the total number of cats the rescue center had after one year.
Number of cats still waiting to be adopted = Total number of cats after one year - Number of cats that found homes
Number of cats still waiting to be adopted = 7857 - 2854

Total number of trucks produced in the first three quarters = Number of trucks produced in the first two quarters + Number of trucks produced in the third quarter
Total number of trucks produced in the first three quarters = 7061 + 2086

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers in the garden.

Given information:
- The garden had a total of 9292 flowers.
- 888 flowers wilted due to changes in the weather.

Step 1: Subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers.
Total number of flowers - Number of wilted flowers = Number of flowers left in the garden
9292 - 888 = 9292 - 888
            = 8404

Therefore, there are 8404 flowers left in the garden after 888 flowers wilted.

Given information:
- In the first year, the lemon tree produced 676 lemons.
- In the second year, the lemon tree produced 2709 lemons.

To find the total number of lemons produced in the two years, we need to add the number of lemons produced in each year.

Total number of lemons produced = Number of lemons produced in the first year + Number of lemons produced in the second year
Total number of lemons produced = 676 + 2709

Since there are two identical lemon trees in the orchard, and each tree produced the same number of lemons, we need to multiply the total number of lemons produced by one tree by 2.

Total number of lemons produced by one tree = 3385 lemons
Total number of lemons produced by two trees = 3385 Ã— 2 = 6770 lemons

To find the total number of stars observed, we need to add the number of stars observed in both hemispheres.

Total number of stars observed = Number of stars observed in one hemisphere + Number of stars observed in the other hemisphere
Total number of stars observed = 3272 + 1862

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the number of pants sold in the first quarter and the second quarter.

Given information:
- In the first quarter, the store sold 2013 blue jeans and 1650 khaki pants.
- In the second quarter, the store sold an additional 1400 pants.

Step 1: Find the total number of pants sold in the first quarter.
Total pants sold in the first quarter = Number of blue jeans sold + Number of khaki pants sold
Total pants sold in the first quarter = 2013 + 1650
Total pants sold in the first quarter = 3663

Step 2: Find the total number of pants sold across the two quarters.
Total pants sold across the two quarters = Total pants sold in the first quarter + Total pants sold in the second quarter
Total pants sold across the two quarters = 3663 + 1400
Total pants sold across the two quarters = 5063

Therefore, the popular clothing store sold a total of 5063 pairs of pants across the first and second quarters.

Given information:
- The store sold 2013 blue jeans in the first quarter.
- The store sold 3298 khaki pants in the first quarter, instead of 1650.

To find the total number of pants sold in the first quarter, we need to add the number of blue jeans and khaki pants sold.

Step 1: Find the total number of pants sold in the first quarter.
Total pants sold in the first quarter = Number of blue jeans sold + Number of khaki pants sold
Total pants sold in the first quarter = 2013 + 3298
Total pants sold in the first quarter = 5311

Therefore, with the updated information, the popular clothing store sold a total of 5311 pairs of pants in the first quarter.

- A solar flare carried away 1291 atoms from these areas.

Step 1: Find the total number of atoms in the two areas.

2987 + 3554 = 6541

Step 2: Subtract the number of atoms carried away by the solar flare from the total number of atoms.
Total number of atoms in the two areas - Number of atoms carried away by the solar flare = Number of atoms left after the solar flare

To find the total number of atoms in these two areas, we need to add the number of atoms in each area.

Step 1: Add the number of atoms in the two small areas.
Number of atoms in the first small area + Number of atoms in the second small area = Total number of atoms in the two areas

Given information:
- Last month, the company produced 6374 toothbrushes.
- This month, they increased production by 93 toothbrushes.

Step 1: Find the number of toothbrushes produced this month.
Number of toothbrushes produced this month = Number of toothbrushes produced last month + Increase in production

Given information:
- The company produced a total of 6467 toothbrushes this month.
- The company distributed 5927 toothbrushes to various pharmacies.

Step 1: Find the number of toothbrushes left with the company after distribution.
Number of toothbrushes left with the company = Total number of toothbrushes produced - Number of toothbrushes distributed
Number of toothbrushes left with the company = 6467 - 5927
Number of toothbrushes left with the company = 540

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the initial number of dogs at the shelter and the number of dogs adopted during the year.

Given information:
- The local dog shelter had 8903 dogs at the beginning of the year.
- 6988 dogs were adopted by the end of the year.

Step 1: Find the number of dogs remaining at the shelter at the end of the year.
Number of dogs remaining = Initial number of dogs - Number of dogs adopted
Number of dogs remaining = 8903 - 6988
Number of dogs remaining = 1915

Therefore, there are 1915 dogs still at the shelter at the end of the year.

- The cheese factory produces 954 lbs of cheddar cheese in a single day.
- The cheese factory produces 7946 lbs of mozzarella cheese in a single day.
- The cheese factory was able to package 4212 lbs of the total cheese produced.

Step 1: Find the total amount of cheese produced in a day.
Total cheese produced = Cheddar cheese produced + Mozzarella cheese produced
Total cheese produced = 954 lbs + 7946 lbs
Total cheese produced = 8900 lbs

Step 2: Find the amount of cheese left unpackaged.
Amount of cheese left unpackaged = Total cheese produced - Amount of cheese packaged

- During the significant exploration phase, the rover traveled an additional 6969 miles.
- After the significant exploration phase, the rover traveled an additional 253 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled up to the end of the significant exploration phase.
Total distance traveled up to the end of the significant exploration phase = Initial distance + Distance during significant exploration phase
Total distance traveled up to the end of the significant exploration phase = 798 miles + 6969 miles
Total distance traveled up to the end of the significant exploration phase = 7767 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled during the entire mission by adding the additional distance after the significant exploration phase.
Total distance traveled during the entire mission = Total distance traveled up to the end of the significant exploration phase + Additional distance after the significant exploration phase
Total distance traveled during the entire mission = 7767 miles + 253 miles
Total distance traveled during the entire mission = 8020 miles

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of precious stones the princess has left in her collection after distributing some stones to her loyal subjects.

Given information:
- The princess initially had 7776 precious stones in her collection.
- On her birthday, she received 449 more precious stones as a gift.
- She distributed 5386 stones among her loyal subjects.

Step 1: Find the total number of precious stones the princess had after receiving the additional stones on her birthday.
Total number of precious stones = Initial number of stones + Additional stones received
Total number of precious stones = 7776 + 449 = 8225

Step 2: Subtract the number of stones distributed from the total number of stones.
Number of stones left in the collection = Total number of stones - Number of stones distributed
Number of stones left in the collection = 8225 - 5386 = 2839

Therefore, after distributing 5386 precious stones among her loyal subjects, the princess now has 2839 precious stones left in her collection.

Given information:
- The princess originally had 552 precious stones in her collection.
- On her birthday, she received 449 more precious stones as a gift.

To find the total number of precious stones the princess has after receiving the gift, we need to add the initial number of stones and the additional stones received.

Step 1: Find the total number of precious stones by adding the initial number of stones and the additional stones received.
Total number of precious stones = Initial number of stones + Additional stones received
Total number of precious stones = 552 + 449
Total number of precious stones = 1001

Therefore, after receiving the additional 449 precious stones on her birthday, the princess now has 1001 precious stones in her collection.

- The second shipment contained 8962 hats.

Step 1: Find the number of hats in the store after the first shipment.
Number of hats after the first shipment = Initial number of hats + Number of hats in the first shipment
Number of hats after the first shipment = 710 + 710 = 1420 hats

Step 2: Find the increase in the number of hats after the second shipment.
Increase in the number of hats = Total number of hats after the second shipment - Number of hats after the first shipment
Increase in the number of hats = 9956 - 1420 = 8536 hats

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to add the number of cows the farmer initially had, the number of cows he bought first, and the number of cows he bought later.

Given information:
- The farmer initially had 411 cows.
- The farmer bought an additional 4442 cows.
- The farmer then bought another 2676 cows.

Step 1: Find the total number of cows the farmer had after the first purchase.
Number of cows the farmer initially had + Number of cows the farmer bought first = Total number of cows after the first purchase
411 + 4442 = 4853 cows

Step 2: Add the number of cows the farmer bought later to the total number of cows after the first purchase.
Total number of cows after the first purchase + Number of cows the farmer bought later = Total number of cows the farmer owns now
4853 + 2676 = 7529 cows

Therefore, the farmer now owns a total of 7529 cows.

Given information:
- The farmer initially had 411 cows.
- The farmer bought an additional 6968 cows in the first lot.

To find the total number of cows the farmer owns now, we need to add the number of cows he initially had to the number of cows he bought in the first lot.

Step 1: Add the number of cows the farmer initially had to the number of cows he bought in the first lot.
Number of cows the farmer initially had + Number of cows the farmer bought in the first lot = Total number of cows the farmer owns now
411 + 6968 = 7379

Step 1: Find the total number of words written in the first 11 chapters.
Total words in the first 11 chapters = 5817 + 118 = 5935 words

Step 2: Find the total number of words written across all chapters, including the new brief chapter.
Total words across all chapters = Total words in the first 11 chapters + Words in the new brief chapter

Step 1: Subtract the number of fireplaces sold from the original number of fireplaces.
Number of fireplaces remaining = Original number of fireplaces - Number of fireplaces sold

- The initial population of Azuria was 6585 unicorns.
- 1972 unicorns had to migrate to a neighboring city due to a terrible storm.

Step 1: Subtract the number of unicorns that migrated from the initial population.
Initial population of Azuria - Number of unicorns that migrated = Remaining unicorns in Azuria
6585 - 1972 = 4613

Therefore, 4613 unicorns remained in Azuria after the storm.

Given information:
- The beach store initially had 8486 beach balls in stock.

Step 1: Find the number of beach balls left in the store after the grand sale.
Number of beach balls left = Initial number of beach balls - Number of beach balls sold
Number of beach balls left = 8486 - 6466

Given information:
- The beach store initially had 8486 beach balls in stock.

- The next day, a shipment of 1597 new beach balls arrived at the store.

Step 1: Find the number of beach balls left after the grand sale.
Number of beach balls left after the sale = Initial number of beach balls - Number of beach balls sold
Number of beach balls left after the sale = 8486 - 6466
Number of beach balls left after the sale = 2020

Step 2: Add the new shipment of beach balls to the remaining beach balls.
Total number of beach balls after the new shipment = Number of beach balls left after the sale + Number of new beach balls
Total number of beach balls after the new shipment = 2020 + 1597
Total number of beach balls after the new shipment = 3617

- During the grand sale, they sold 6466 beach balls.

Step 1: Find the number of beach balls left in the store after the grand sale.
Number of beach balls left = Initial number of beach balls - Number of beach balls sold
Number of beach balls left = 9648 - 6466

Step 2: Calculate the number of beach balls left.
Number of beach balls left = 9648 - 6466
Number of beach balls left = 3182

- The difference between the number of boxes of oranges sold and the number of boxes of apples sold is 1535.

Step 1: Find the total number of boxes of oranges, apples, and mangoes sold.
Total boxes sold = Number of boxes of oranges sold + Number of boxes of apples sold + Number of boxes of mangoes sold
Total boxes sold = 5358 + 3823 + 2458

Step 1: Find the total number of books added to the library initially.
Initial books added = Initial donation + Purchased books
Initial books added = 5059 + 3653
Initial books added = 8712 books

Step 2: Find the total number of books added to the library, including the additional donation from the graduate student.
Total books added = Initial books added + Additional donation
Total books added = 8712 + 500
Total books added = 9212 books

Therefore, a total of 9212 books were added to the library's collection.

Given information:
- The library received a donation of 5059 books.
- The library purchased 4833 books (corrected number).

Step 1: Find the total number of books added to the library.
Total books added = Donated books + Purchased books
Total books added = 5059 + 4833
Total books added = 9892

Therefore, considering the adjusted record, the total number of books added to the library's collection is 9892.

To find the total number of pairs of pants, we need to add the initial number of pairs and the additional pairs received.

Total number of pairs of pants = Initial number of pairs + Additional pairs received
Total number of pairs of pants = 1915 + 6336

Given information:
- The store had a total of 8251 pairs of pants after receiving the additional delivery.

To find the number of pairs remaining, we need to subtract the number of pairs sold from the total number of pairs the store had before the sale.

Number of pairs remaining = Total number of pairs before the sale - Number of pairs sold
Number of pairs remaining = 8251 - 3290
Number of pairs remaining = 4961

Given information:
- The company manufactured 1488 pens in the morning.
- The company manufactured 6008 pens in the afternoon.
- 2709 pens were defective and couldn't be sold.

Step 1: Find the total number of pens manufactured.
Total number of pens manufactured = Number of pens made in the morning + Number of pens made in the afternoon
Total number of pens manufactured = 1488 + 6008
Total number of pens manufactured = 7496

Step 2: Subtract the number of defective pens from the total number of pens manufactured.
Number of pens that could be sold = Total number of pens manufactured - Number of defective pens

Step 1: Find the total number of criminal cases recorded in the last two years.
Total criminal cases = Criminal cases last year + Criminal cases this year
Total criminal cases = 2506 + 6401

Given information:
- Last year, the police department recorded 2506 criminal cases.
- This year, the number of criminal cases increased to 853 (instead of 6401).

To find the total number of criminal cases recorded in the last two years, we need to add the cases from last year and this year.

Step 1: Find the number of criminal cases recorded this year.
Number of criminal cases this year = 853

Step 2: Find the total number of criminal cases recorded in the last two years.
Total criminal cases = Criminal cases last year + Criminal cases this year
Total criminal cases = 2506 + 853
Total criminal cases = 3359

Given information:
- Your juice brand produced 6500 bottles of apple juice.
- 6150 bottles of apple juice have already been sold.

Step 1: Find the number of bottles left.
Number of bottles left = Total bottles produced - Number of bottles sold
Number of bottles left = 6500 - 6150
Number of bottles left = 350

Therefore, your juice brand has 350 bottles of apple juice left.

Given information:
- Your juice brand initially produced 6500 bottles of apple juice.
- 6150 bottles of apple juice were sold.
- After the initial sales, your brand produced an additional 9280 bottles.

Step 1: Find the number of bottles left after the initial sales.
Number of bottles left after initial sales = Total bottles initially produced - Number of bottles sold
Number of bottles left after initial sales = 6500 - 6150
Number of bottles left after initial sales = 350

Step 2: Find the total number of bottles after producing the additional bottles.
Total number of bottles = Number of bottles left after initial sales + Additional bottles produced
Total number of bottles = 350 + 9280
Total number of bottles = 9630

Given information:
- Your juice brand produced 6500 bottles of apple juice.
- Your juice brand managed to sell 2086 bottles of apple juice.

To find the number of bottles left, we need to subtract the number of bottles sold from the total number of bottles produced.

Step 1: Find the number of bottles left.
Number of bottles left = Total bottles produced - Number of bottles sold
Number of bottles left = 6500 - 2086
Number of bottles left = 4414

Therefore, if your juice brand had initially produced 6500 bottles of apple juice but managed to sell only 2086 bottles, your brand would have 4414 bottles of apple juice left.

- The new square footage of the housing model is 900 square feet.

Step 1: Find the difference between the original square footage and the new square footage.
Reduction in square footage = Original square footage - New square footage
Reduction in square footage = 951 square feet - 900 square feet
Reduction in square footage = 51 square feet

Given information:
- The original square footage of the larger housing model was 3018 square feet.
- The new square footage of the housing model is 900 square feet.

To find the reduction in square footage, we need to calculate the difference between the original square footage and the new square footage.

Step 1: Find the difference between the original square footage and the new square footage.
Reduction in square footage = Original square footage - New square footage
Reduction in square footage = 3018 square feet - 900 square feet
Reduction in square footage = 2118 square feet

Therefore, the larger housing model of 3018 square feet was reduced by 2118 square feet to become the new model of 900 square feet.

Given information:
- 7495 marshmallows were toasted for s'mores.

To find the total number of marshmallows toasted, we need to add the number of marshmallows toasted for s'mores and the additional marshmallows toasted later.

Total number of marshmallows toasted = Number of marshmallows toasted for s'mores + Additional marshmallows toasted later
Total number of marshmallows toasted = 7495 + 1403
Total number of marshmallows toasted = 8898

To find the number of endangered frog species, we need to subtract the number of non-endangered species from the total number of frog species.

Number of endangered frog species = Total number of frog species - Number of non-endangered frog species
Number of endangered frog species = 6336 - 2712

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the updated boy births and the girl births recorded in 2020.

Given information:
- Updated number of boy births recorded in 2020 = 3141

Given information:
- At the beginning of the day, there were 8210 fish in the large tank.

Step 1: Find the number of fish that remained in the large tank after moving 158 fish to other tanks.
Number of fish remaining = Initial number of fish - Number of fish moved
Number of fish remaining = 8210 - 158

Given information:
- The crayon factory initially produced 8415 crayons.
- With the improved quality process, only 281 crayons did not pass the quality check.

To find the number of crayons that passed the quality check, we need to subtract the number of crayons that did not pass from the total number of crayons produced.

Step 1: Find the number of crayons that passed the quality check.
Number of crayons that passed the quality check = Total crayons produced - Crayons that did not pass the quality check
Number of crayons that passed the quality check = 8415 - 281
Number of crayons that passed the quality check = 8134

Therefore, with the improved quality process, 8134 crayons successfully passed the quality check.

Step 1: Add the number of coins already in the chest to the number of coins added.
Number of coins in the chest after adding more coins = Initial number of coins + Number of coins added
Number of coins in the chest after adding more coins = 7360 + 1751

- The pirate used 8031 coins to buy a new ship.

Step 1: Find the number of coins in the treasure chest after adding 1751 coins.
Number of coins in the chest after adding more coins = Initial number of coins + Number of coins added
Number of coins in the chest after adding more coins = 7360 + 1751 = 9111

Step 2: Subtract the number of coins used to buy the new ship from the total number of coins in the chest.
Number of coins left in the chest = Number of coins in the chest after adding more coins - Number of coins used to buy the new ship
Number of coins left in the chest = 9111 - 8031 = 1080

Given:
- The pirate initially thought there were 5092 coins in the chest.
- After a recount, it was found that there were actually 5092 coins before adding the additional 1751 coins.
- The pirate added 1751 more coins to the chest.

To find the total number of coins in the treasure chest now, we need to add the initial number of coins (5092) to the additional coins added (1751).

Step 1: Add the initial number of coins to the additional coins added.
Total number of coins in the chest = Initial number of coins + Additional coins added
Total number of coins in the chest = 5092 + 1751
Total number of coins in the chest = 6843

Therefore, after the recount and adding 1751 more coins, the treasure chest now holds 6843 gold coins before the pirate pays for the new ship.

Step 1: Add the number of small family tents and the number of medium-sized tents.
Total number of tents = Number of small family tents + Number of medium-sized tents
Total number of tents = 1614 + 7237

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tents.

Step 1: Subtract the number of tents taken down from the initial number of tents.
Number of tents left standing = Initial number of tents - Number of tents taken down
Number of tents left standing = 8851 - 2482

Step 2: Calculate the number of tents left standing.
Number of tents left standing = 8851 - 2482

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sunglasses that are not defective.

Given information:
- The sunglass factory produced 7817 sunglasses in a month.
- 3036 of these sunglasses are defective and were removed.

To find the number of effective sunglasses that remain, we need to subtract the number of defective sunglasses from the total number of sunglasses produced.

Step 1: Find the number of effective sunglasses.
Number of effective sunglasses = Total sunglasses produced - Number of defective sunglasses
Number of effective sunglasses = 7817 - 3036
Number of effective sunglasses = 4781

Therefore, 4781 effective sunglasses remain after removing the defective ones.

Given information:
- The sunglass factory actually produced 7575 sunglasses, not 7817.
- 3036 of these sunglasses are defective and were removed.

To find the number of effective sunglasses that remain, we need to subtract the number of defective sunglasses from the corrected total number of sunglasses produced.

Step 1: Find the number of effective sunglasses.
Number of effective sunglasses = Corrected total sunglasses produced - Number of defective sunglasses
Number of effective sunglasses = 7575 - 3036

Given information:
- The butterfly enthusiast spotted 6983 butterflies in the summer.

Step 1: Subtract the number of butterflies spotted in the winter from the number of butterflies spotted in the summer.
Number of fewer butterflies spotted in the winter = Number of butterflies spotted in the summer - Number of butterflies spotted in the winter
Number of fewer butterflies spotted in the winter = 6983 - 4890

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of beach balls the toy store has after receiving the new shipment.

Given information:
- The toy store started the day with 824 beach balls in stock.
- The toy store received a new shipment of 4913 beach balls.

To find the total number of beach balls, we need to add the initial stock and the new shipment.

Total number of beach balls = Initial stock + New shipment
Total number of beach balls = 824 + 4913
Total number of beach balls = 5737

Therefore, the toy store now has 5737 beach balls.

Given information:
- The toy store had a total of 5737 beach balls after receiving the new shipment.
- The toy store sold 4353 beach balls at a local fair.

To find the number of beach balls remaining, we need to subtract the number of beach balls sold from the total number of beach balls.

Number of beach balls remaining = Total number of beach balls - Number of beach balls sold
Number of beach balls remaining = 5737 - 4353
Number of beach balls remaining = 1384

Given:
- The toy store started the day with 824 beach balls in stock.
- The actual number of beach balls received in the new shipment is 6402 (not 4913).

To find the total number of beach balls, we need to add the initial stock and the new shipment.

Total number of beach balls = Initial stock + New shipment

* So the number of mice remaining was 8055 - 7323 = 732
* Then, a nearby mouse colony joined them, doubling their number

To find the new number of mice, we take the remaining mice (732) and double it:

Change in monkey population = Number of monkeys welcomed - Number of monkeys sent to other zoos
Change in monkey population = 5547 - 3195
Change in monkey population = 2352

Since the change in the monkey population is positive, it means that the current population of monkeys at the zoo has increased by 2352.

- The zoo received another shipment of 1959 monkeys from a burst of new rescues.

Step 1: Find the change in the monkey population after the initial welcome and transfer.
Change in monkey population = Number of monkeys welcomed - Number of monkeys sent to other zoos
Change in monkey population = 5547 - 3195
Change in monkey population = 2352

- They made an additional batch of 490 candles.

Step 1: Find the number of viable candles after the first batch.
Number of viable candles after the first batch = Total candles produced - Number of defective candles
Number of viable candles after the first batch = 5725 - 2594
Number of viable candles after the first batch = 3131

Step 2: Find the total number of viable candles after the second batch.
Total number of viable candles = Number of viable candles after the first batch + Number of candles from the second batch

Given information:
- The candle factory produced 4777 candles initially.
- 2594 candles were found to be defective and had to be discarded.

Step 1: Find the number of viable (non-defective) candles.
Number of viable candles = Total candles produced - Number of defective candles
Number of viable candles = 4777 - 2594
Number of viable candles = 2183

Therefore, with the updated count, 2183 viable candles remained from the initial production after discarding the defective ones.

* The total points scored in the first game was 2491 + 3947 = 6438 points
* In the second game, both teams together scored an additional 3214 points

To find the grand total of points scored in both games, we need to add the points scored in the first game and the second game.

Points scored in the first game: 6438
Points scored in the second game: 3214

Grand total of points scored = Points scored in first game + Points scored in second game

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of starfish spotted after two months, which is the sum of the initial number of starfish and the new starfish spotted.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 6778 starfish found in a particular region of the ocean.
- After two months, 283 new starfish were spotted in the same region.

Step 1: Find the total number of starfish after two months.
Total number of starfish = Initial number of starfish + New starfish spotted
Total number of starfish = 6778 + 283
Total number of starfish = 7061

Therefore, after two months, a total of 7061 starfish were spotted in that particular region of the ocean.

Given information:
- Initially, there were 687 starfish found in a particular region of the ocean.
- After two months, 283 new starfish were spotted in the same region.

Step 1: Find the total number of starfish after two months.
Total number of starfish = Initial number of starfish + New starfish spotted
Total number of starfish = 687 + 283
Total number of starfish = 970

Therefore, with the corrected initial number of 687 starfish and the additional 283 starfish spotted after two months, the total number of starfish in that particular region of the ocean would be 970.

Given information:
- The elephant sanctuary initially had 8483 elephants.
- The sanctuary recently rescued 118 more elephants.
- They had to relocate 3166 elephants to another location due to overpopulation.

Step 1: Find the total number of elephants in the sanctuary after the recent rescue.
Total number of elephants after the rescue = Initial number of elephants + Number of elephants rescued
Total number of elephants after the rescue = 8483 + 118 = 8601

Step 2: Subtract the number of elephants relocated from the total number of elephants after the rescue.

Step 1: Find the amount of potatoes that are of good quality and can be sold.
Amount of good quality potatoes = Total potatoes harvested - Low quality potatoes
Amount of good quality potatoes = 5580 kg - 588 kg

Step 1: Find the amount of potatoes that are of good quality and can be sold.
Amount of good quality potatoes = Total potatoes harvested - Low quality potatoes
Amount of good quality potatoes = 5080 kg - 588 kg
