* The car rental company had a total of 17 cars available in the morning.
* By the end of the day, they only had 4 cars left.
* To find the number of cars rented out during the day, we need to subtract the number of cars left at the end of the day from the total number of cars available in the morning.

Calculation:
* Total cars available in the morning: 17
* Cars left at the end of the day: 4
* Cars rented out during the day: 17 - 4 = 13

The butterfly collector caught 13 butterflies in the morning.
At the end of the day, there were only 6 butterflies in his collection.
This means that the number of butterflies that flew away during the day is:
13 (caught in the morning) - 6 (remaining at the end of the day) = 7 butterflies.

            <span class="response-field">Claude-3 Haiku:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Originally, there was a whole cake that was cut into h slices
* Each slice was equal in size
* 12 pieces were eaten during the party
* There is 1 piece of cake left

To find the total number of slices in the whole cake, we can use the following equation:
Total slices in the whole cake = Slices eaten + Slices remaining

We know that 12 slices were eaten, and there is 1 slice remaining. So:
Total slices in the whole cake = 12 + 1 = 13

Therefore, the whole cake was originally cut into 13 equal slices.

* Anne originally had some number of pairs of socks
* She then bought 15 new pairs
* Now she has a total of 20 pairs

To find the original number of pairs she had, we can use the following equation:
Original pairs + 15 new pairs = 20 total pairs

Rearranging this equation, we get:
Original pairs = 20 total pairs - 15 new pairs
Original pairs = 20 - 15
Original pairs = 5

The superhero's base super strength level is 1 unit.
When the superhero dons the super strength amulet, their total strength level becomes 12 units.
To find the extra strength units provided by the amulet, we need to subtract the base strength level from the total strength level.
Extra strength units = Total strength level - Base strength level
Extra strength units = 12 - 1 = 11 units

* Samantha has 13 green crayons
* She has a total of 15 crayons
* To find the number of crayons that are not green, we need to subtract the number of green crayons from the total number of crayons

So, the number of crayons that are not green is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The sock store started the day with 3 pairs of red socks
* By the end of the day, they had 15 pairs of red socks
* We need to find how many pairs of red socks they added to their inventory

To find the number of pairs of red socks they added, we need to subtract the starting number of pairs from the ending number of pairs.

The starting number of pairs was 3.
The ending number of pairs was 15.

So, the number of pairs they added is:
15 pairs - 3 pairs = 12 pairs

* The firefighter heard a total of 6 alarms in one day
* He heard 4 alarms before lunch
* To find the number of alarms he heard after lunch, we need to subtract the number of alarms before lunch from the total number of alarms

So, the number of alarms he heard after lunch is:
Total alarms - Alarms before lunch = Alarms after lunch
6 - 4 = 2

To find the number of cats that went outside to play, we need to subtract the number of cats that remained in the living room from the initial number of cats.
18 cats - 17 cats = 1 cat
Therefore, 1 cat went outside to play.

* Initially, the small snowman was built using 3 large snowballs.
* Over time, the snowman grew and became comprised of a total of 4 large snowballs.
* We need to find how many more snowballs were added to the snowman.

To do this, we can subtract the initial number of snowballs (3) from the final number of snowballs (4):
* 4 - 3 = 1

Therefore, 1 more snowball was added to the snowman.

The school bus started with 14 students on board.
After dropping off some students, there were only 7 students left on the bus.
To find the number of students dropped off, we need to subtract the number of students left on the bus from the initial number of students on the bus.
Number of students dropped off = Initial number of students - Number of students left on the bus
Number of students dropped off = 14 - 7 = 7

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The cheese maker produced 9 pounds of swiss cheese in the morning.
By the end of the day, the total cheese production was 16 pounds.
To find the amount of additional cheese produced by the end of the day, we need to subtract the initial 9 pounds from the total 16 pounds.
16 pounds - 9 pounds = 7 pounds
Therefore, 7 pounds more cheese was produced by the end of the day.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Sarah has a total of 6 pillows
* 4 of them are stuffed with feathers
* The rest are stuffed with foam

To find the number of pillows stuffed with foam, we need to subtract the number of feather-stuffed pillows from the total number of pillows.

Total pillows = 6
Feather-stuffed pillows = 4
Foam-stuffed pillows = Total pillows - Feather-stuffed pillows
Foam-stuffed pillows = 6 - 4 = 2

The pirate originally had some number of gold coins, and he stashed away 4 of them, leaving him with 1 coin.
Let's call the original number of gold coins that the pirate had 'x'.
We know that the pirate stashed away 4 coins, so he had x - 4 coins left.
We also know that he now has 1 coin left, so x - 4 = 1.
Solving for x, we get:
x - 4 = 1
x = 5

Therefore, the pirate originally had 5 gold coins before stashing them away.

* The band had prepared 8 songs for the live performance

The shop started the day with 14 soaps in their inventory.
By the end of the day, the total inventory was 19 soaps.
To find the number of soaps they made during the day, we need to subtract the starting inventory from the ending inventory.
19 soaps - 14 soaps = 5 soaps
Therefore, the shop made 5 soaps during the day.

* Sylvia started with 10 bars of soap from her last batch
* By the end of the day, she had 14 bars of soap
* We need to find out how many new bars of soap she made

To calculate the number of new bars of soap, we take the final number of bars (14) and subtract the initial number of bars (10):
* 14 - 10 = 4

Therefore, Sylvia made 4 new bars of soap.

* The factory starts the day producing a rope that is 13 meters long.
* By the end of the day, the total length of rope is 19 meters.
* We need to find the length of the second rope that was produced.

To do this, we can use the following equation:
Length of first rope + Length of second rope = Total length of rope
13 meters + Length of second rope = 19 meters

Solving for the length of the second rope:
Length of second rope = 19 meters - 13 meters
Length of second rope = 6 meters

* The musician started with 17 guitar strings
* After restringing some guitars, he was left with only 2 strings
* To find the number of guitar strings he used, we need to subtract the number of strings he had left (2) from the number of strings he started with (17)

17 guitar strings - 2 guitar strings = 15 guitar strings

1) A typical rainbow has 7 visible colors.
2) The special prism shows a total of 13 colors in the rainbow.
3) To find the number of additional colors visible through the prism, we need to subtract the number of colors in a typical rainbow from the total number of colors shown by the prism.
4) 13 colors (shown by the prism) - 7 colors (in a typical rainbow) = 6 additional colors.

* A full grown giraffe typically grows to a height of x meters
* A young giraffe was just 1 meter shorter than a full grown one when it was 3 meters tall

This means that when the young giraffe was 3 meters tall, the full grown giraffe would be 3 + 1 = 4 meters tall.

Therefore, the typical height of a fully grown giraffe is x = 4 meters.

* The snowman originally had a certain number of snowballs
* 7 snowballs were removed
* After the 7 snowballs were removed, 11 snowballs remained
