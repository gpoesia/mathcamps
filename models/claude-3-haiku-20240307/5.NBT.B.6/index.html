* The astronaut has a 90-day mission in space
* He consumes a total of 3870 liters of oxygen during the mission
* His oxygen consumption is the same every day

To find his daily oxygen consumption, we need to divide the total oxygen consumed by the number of days in the mission.

Total oxygen consumed: 3870 liters
Number of days in the mission: 90 days

Daily oxygen consumption = Total oxygen consumed / Number of days
Daily oxygen consumption = 3870 liters / 90 days
Daily oxygen consumption = &lt;&lt;3870 / 90 = 43&gt;&gt; 43 liters per day

Total oxygen consumed: 3870 liters

Daily oxygen consumption = Total oxygen consumed / Number of days
Daily oxygen consumption = 3870 liters / 124 days

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Alright, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The cat catches 2784 mice over a period of 27 months
* To find the number of mice caught per month, we divide the total number of mice caught by the number of months

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work this out:
* The child originally had 36 toy trucks and split them evenly among 18 stuffed animals, so each stuffed animal got 2 toy trucks.
* The child then found another stash of 2925 toy trucks.
* He continues to distribute the 2925 toy trucks evenly among his 18 stuffed animals.

To calculate how many additional toy trucks each stuffed animal gets:
* Total additional toy trucks: 2925
* Number of stuffed animals: 18
* Additional toy trucks per stuffed animal: 2925 / 18 = 162.5

Since we can't have a fractional number of toy trucks, the answer is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The manufacturer produced a total of 7712 sunglasses
* The production was done across 69 different runs
* Each run produced an equal number of sunglasses

To find the number of sunglasses made in each run, we need to divide the total number of sunglasses by the number of runs.

Total sunglasses: 7712
Number of runs: 69

Sunglasses per run = 7712 / 69 = &lt;&lt;7712/69=112&gt;&gt;112

* 1021 kilograms / 59 plants = &lt;&lt;1021/59=17.31&gt;&gt;17.31 kilograms per plant on average.

* The mouse can travel a total distance of 4928 meters

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The beach resort now has 1120 pounds of sand for the event
* They still need to divide the sand evenly among 80 competitor stations
* To find the amount of sand at each station, we need to divide the total amount of sand by the number of stations

Calculation:
* Total sand: 1120 pounds
* Number of stations: 80
* Amount of sand per station = 1120 pounds / 80 stations = &lt;&lt;1120 / 80 = 14&gt;&gt; 14 pounds per station

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The metalsmith has 1610 grams of silver
* He uses 70 grams of silver for each ring
* To find the number of rings he can create, we need to divide the total amount of silver by the amount of silver used per ring

Calculation:
* Total silver: 1610 grams
* Silver per ring: 70 grams
* Number of rings = 1610 grams / 70 grams per ring
* Number of rings = 1610 / 70
* Number of rings = 23

* The crate contains 8840 apples
* The apples are equally distributed into 44 bags

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The doctor spent a total of 1047 minutes talking with patients over the past 56 days.
* We need to find how many minutes the doctor spends talking with patients each day.
* To do this, we divide the total minutes by the number of days:
* 1047 minutes / 56 days = &lt;&lt;1047/56=18.7&gt;&gt;18.7 minutes per day.

* The original pair of binoculars cost $702

First, we need to calculate the refund amount for the original pair of binoculars:

* $13 x 54 = $702 total refund

Now, we need to calculate the cost per person for the new pair of binoculars:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The boat consumed 204 liters of fuel during a journey of 51 hours.
To find the amount of fuel consumed in one hour, we need to divide the total fuel consumed by the total number of hours.
Fuel consumed per hour = Total fuel consumed / Total hours
Fuel consumed per hour = 204 liters / 51 hours
Fuel consumed per hour = &lt;&lt;204 liters / 51 hours = 4 liters/hour&gt;&gt;4 liters/hour

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work this out step-by-step:
* The boat originally consumed 204 liters of fuel during a 51-hour journey
* This means the boat consumed 204 liters / 51 hours = 4 liters per hour
* Now, the boat only has 100 liters of fuel to start with for the same 51-hour journey
* Since the boat consumes 4 liters per hour, and it has 100 liters to start with, the boat will run out of fuel after:
* 100 liters / 4 liters per hour = 25 hours
* So the boat will only be able to travel for 25 hours with 100 liters of fuel
* Therefore, the fuel consumed per hour is now:
* 100 liters / 25 hours = &lt;&lt;100 liters / 25 hours = 4 liters/hour&gt;&gt;4 liters/hour

* In the previous year, the hat maker produced 1083 hats over 57 weeks
* This means the hat maker produced 1083 / 57 = 19 hats per week

* In the following year, the hat maker produced a total of 7678 hats over 57 weeks
* To find the number of hats produced weekly, we divide the total hats by the number of weeks:
* 7678 hats / 57 weeks = &lt;&lt;7678/57=134.7&gt;&gt;134.7 hats per week

            The city decides to reconfigure the park by further dividing the 1927 acre park into 411 equal sections instead to accommodate more activities and recreational facilities. If each new section is of equal size, how large is each section in acres now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The city park covers an area of 1927 acres
* The area is now divided into 411 equal sections
* We need to find the size of each new section in acres

To find the size of each new section, we need to divide the total area by the new number of sections:
* Total area = 1927 acres
* New number of sections = 411
* Size of each new section = 1927 acres / 411 sections
* Size of each new section = &lt;&lt;1927 / 411 = 4.69&gt;&gt; 4.69 acres

* The backpacker plans a shorter journey of 2714 miles
* The backpacker still intends to walk the same distance each day for 62 days

To find the new distance the backpacker plans to walk each day, we need to divide the total distance by the number of days:
* Total distance: 2714 miles
* Number of days: 62 days
* Distance per day = 2714 miles / 62 days = &lt;&lt;2714/62=43.77&gt;&gt;43.77 miles

            The benefactor decided to be even more generous and increased the number of gifts to 3697. If these additional gifts were also evenly divided between the 13 shelters, then how many gifts did each shelter receive now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The benefactor originally donated 741 gifts, which were evenly divided between 13 shelters. So each shelter received 741 / 13 = 57 gifts.
2) The benefactor then increased the number of gifts to 3697.
3) The additional gifts (3697 - 741 = 2956) were also evenly divided between the 13 shelters.
4) To find the number of additional gifts each shelter received, we divide the additional gifts by the number of shelters: 2956 / 13 = 227.

5) Therefore, the total number of gifts each shelter received is the original 57 gifts plus the additional 227 gifts, which is:
57 + 227 = 284 gifts per shelter.

* The slide is 728 inches long

To find the number of waves, we need to divide the total length of the slide by the spacing between the waves.

728 inches / 56 inches per wave = &lt;&lt;728/56=13&gt;&gt;13 waves

* The new length of the slide is 3769 inches
* The waves are still placed every 56 inches

To find the number of waves, we need to divide the total length of the slide by the spacing between the waves.

3769 inches / 56 inches per wave = &lt;&lt;3769/56=67.3&gt;&gt;67.3 waves

Since we can't have a fractional number of waves, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the redesigned slide will have &lt;&lt;67&gt;&gt; waves.
