            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides.
The length of the rectangle is 50m.
The width of the rectangle is 15m.
The perimeter is therefore: 2 x (length) + 2 x (width)
Perimeter = 2 x (50m) + 2 x (15m)
Perimeter = 100m + 30m
Perimeter = 130m

The previous rectangle had a length of 50m and a width of 15m.
The new rectangle has the same length of 50m, but the width has been reduced to 9m.
To calculate the new perimeter, we use the formula:
Perimeter = 2 x (length) + 2 x (width)
Perimeter = 2 x (50m) + 2 x (9m)
Perimeter = 100m + 18m

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The rectangular fence has a side length of 5m and another side of 19m.
* To find the perimeter, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides.
* The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as: 2 x (length) + 2 x (width)
* In this case, the length is 19m and the width is 5m.

* The rectangle has a length of 18 meters
* The rectangle has a width of 44 meters
* The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all four sides

1) The original rectangle had a length of 43m and a width of 41m.
2) The new rectangle has a length of 18m and a width of 41m.
3) The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: 2 x (length + width)

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The rectangle has a length of 20m.
2) All of the sides are of equal length, which means this is a square.
3) The perimeter of a square is calculated by adding up the lengths of all four sides.
4) Since all sides are equal, the perimeter is 4 times the length of one side.
5) The length of one side is 20m, since it is a square.
6) Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is 4 x 20m = 80m.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The rectangle has one side that measures 36 meters
* The rectangle has another side that measures 42 meters
* To find the perimeter, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides
* The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as: 2 x (length + width)
* In this case, the length is 36 meters and the width is 42 meters
* So the perimeter would be: 2 x (36 + 42) = 2 x 78 = 156 meters

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The longer side of the rectangle is 4 times the length of the shorter side.
2) The longer side measures 39 meters.
3) We are asked to find the area of the rectangle when the shorter side is 10 meters.

To find the area, we need to know the length of both sides.

Given information:
- The longer side is 4 times the length of the shorter side.
- The longer side measures 39 meters.
- The shorter side measures 10 meters.

Step 1: Find the length of the longer side.
Since the longer side is 4 times the length of the shorter side, we can use the following equation:
Longer side = 4 Ã— Shorter side
Longer side = 4 Ã— 10 = 40 meters

Step 2: Calculate the area of the rectangle.
Area = Length Ã— Width
Area = 40 meters Ã— 10 meters = 400 square meters

1) The length of the rectangular plot is 32 meters.
2) The width of the rectangular plot is 18 meters.
3) To calculate the area of a rectangle, we multiply the length by the width.
4) Area = Length x Width
5) Area = 32 m x 18 m

The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all four sides.
The length of one side is 15m and the length of the other side is 10m.
To find the perimeter, we add the lengths of all four sides:
Perimeter = 15m + 10m + 15m + 10m

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The area of the playground is given as the product of 17 and 44.
2) The area of a rectangle is calculated as: Area = length x width
3) So, we can say that: 17 x 44 = length x width
4) To find the area in square meters, we need to multiply the length and width together.
5) 17 x 44 = 748 square meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The original rectangle had one side of 14 cm and the other side of 21 cm.
* The new rectangle has one side of 14 cm and the other side of 47 cm.
* To calculate the new perimeter, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides:
* 2 x 14 cm (the two shorter sides) = 28 cm
* 2 x 47 cm (the two longer sides) = 94 cm
* Total perimeter = 28 cm + 94 cm = 122 cm

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The rectangle now has a length of 6m and a width of 29m.
2) The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all four sides.
3) The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: 2 x (length + width)
4) Plugging in the new values, we get: 2 x (6m + 29m) = 2 x 35m = 70m

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The original rectangle had one side of length 45m and another side of length 47m.
2) The original perimeter was calculated as:
P = 2(45m) + 2(47m)
P = 90m + 94m
P = 184m

3) Now, the length of one side has been altered from 47m to 46m.

P = 2(45m) + 2(46m)
P = 90m + 92m
P = 182m
