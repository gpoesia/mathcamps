            There are 535 fish in a large tank and a shark eats 461 of them in one sitting. If the shark continues this pattern and only eats when there are 461 or more fish to consume, how many fish will be leftover after its dinner?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 535 fish in the large tank initially.
2) The shark eats 461 of them in one sitting.
3) This leaves 535 - 461 = 74 fish remaining in the tank.
4) The shark will only eat again when there are 461 or more fish to consume.
5) Since there are only 74 fish left, the shark will not eat again.
6) Therefore, the number of fish leftover after the shark's dinner is 74.

1) The baker baked a total of 928 cookies.
2) He decided to distribute equal amounts of cookies to 186 orphanages.
3) We need to find out how many cookies each orphanage will receive, and then how many cookies are left over.

To find how many cookies each orphanage will receive, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of orphanages:
* 928 cookies / 186 orphanages = 5 cookies per orphanage

Now, we can multiply the number of cookies per orphanage by the number of orphanages to find the total number of cookies distributed:
* 5 cookies per orphanage x 186 orphanages = 930 cookies distributed

Finally, we can find the number of cookies left over by subtracting the total cookies distributed from the total cookies baked:
* 928 cookies baked - 930 cookies distributed = -2 cookies left over

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The wizard casts a spell to summon 932 magical stones.
2) Each powerful creature he summons requires 193 stones.
3) We need to find out how many stones the wizard will have left after summoning several creatures.

To do this, we need to figure out how many creatures the wizard can summon with the 932 stones.

We can do this by dividing the total number of stones (932) by the number of stones required per creature (193):
932 Ã· 193 = 4.83

Since we can't summon a fraction of a creature, we'll round down to 4 creatures.

Now we can calculate the number of stones used by the 4 creatures:
4 creatures x 193 stones per creature = 772 stones used

Finally, we can calculate the number of stones the wizard will have left:
932 stones - 772 stones used = 160 stones left

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work this out step-by-step:

1) The wizard originally had 932 magical stones.
2) The ancient tome said each creature actually needs 544 stones, not 193.
3) We need to find out how many creatures the wizard can summon with the 932 stones, based on the 544-stone requirement.

To do this, we divide the total number of stones (932) by the number of stones required per creature (544):
932 Ã· 544 = 1.71

Since we can't summon a fraction of a creature, we'll round down to 1 creature.

Now we can calculate the number of stones used by the 1 creature:
1 creature x 544 stones per creature = 544 stones used

Finally, we can calculate the number of stones the wizard will have left:
932 stones - 544 stones used = 388 stones left

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The builder has to install 660 square feet of tiles
* Each tile can cover 335 square feet
* The tiles are installed evenly across the available space

To find the square feet the last tile needs to cover, we need to first find out how many full tiles can be installed.

We can do this by dividing the total square feet (660) by the square feet each tile can cover (335):
* 660 / 335 = 1.97 tiles

Since we can't have a partial tile, we round down to 1 full tile.

Now, we can find the remaining square feet that the last tile needs to cover by subtracting the square feet of the full tile from the total square feet:
* 660 - (1 * 335) = 325 square feet

First, let's calculate how many full tiles can be installed:
* 660 square feet / 337 square feet per tile = 1.96 tiles

Since we can't have a partial tile, we round down to 1 full tile.

Now, we can find the remaining square feet that the last tile needs to cover:

1) The juice company produced 473 gallons of juice.
2) The company bottles the juice in 22-gallon containers.
3) To find how many 22-gallon containers can be filled, we divide the total gallons of juice (473) by the size of each container (22):
473 gallons / 22 gallons per container = 21.5 containers
4) Since we can't have a partial container, we round down to 21 containers.
5) Each container holds 22 gallons, so 21 containers hold 21 * 22 = 462 gallons.

1) The wildlife reserve has 740 tigers total.
2) Each zone can hold up to 696 tigers.
3) The tigers are distributed evenly among the zones.

To find the number of tigers in the last zone, we need to first find out how many zones there are.

We can do this by dividing the total number of tigers (740) by the maximum number of tigers per zone (696):
740 / 696 = 1.06 zones

Since we can't have a fractional zone, we round up to 2 zones.

Now, we can calculate the number of tigers in the first zone:
696 tigers

And the number of tigers in the second (last) zone:
740 - 696 = 44 tigers

1) The postman has to deliver 891 letters total.
2) Each mailbox can only hold 616 letters.
3) The postman will put an equal number of letters in each mailbox.

To find the number of letters that will remain in the last mailbox, we need to first find out how many mailboxes the postman will need.

We can do this by dividing the total number of letters (891) by the maximum capacity of each mailbox (616):
891 / 616 = 1.45

Since we can't have a fractional number of mailboxes, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means the postman will need 2 mailboxes.

Now, we can calculate the number of letters that will go in each mailbox:
891 letters / 2 mailboxes = 445.5 letters per mailbox

Since we can't have a fractional number of letters, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means each mailbox will hold 445 letters.

Finally, we can calculate the number of letters that will remain in the last mailbox:
891 total letters - (2 mailboxes x 445 letters per mailbox) = 1 letter

* There are a total of 941 flies jumping around the pond
* Every time a frog jumps, it eats exactly 258 flies
* After a series of jumps, we want to know how many flies are left

To find the number of flies left, we need to determine how many times the frog jumped and how many flies it ate in total.

Let's start by dividing the total number of flies (941) by the number of flies the frog eats per jump (258):
* 941 / 258 = 3.64

This tells us that the frog jumped approximately 3.64 times. Since we can't have a fractional number of jumps, we'll round down to 3 jumps.

Now, we can calculate the total number of flies the frog ate:
* 3 jumps x 258 flies per jump = 774 flies

Finally, we can subtract the total number of flies the frog ate from the original 941 flies to find the number of flies left:

* The frog eats 258 flies in each jump

To find the number of flies left, we need to determine how many times the frog jumped and how many flies it ate in total.

Let's start by dividing the total number of flies (146) by the number of flies the frog eats per jump (258):
* 146 / 258 = 0.56

This tells us that the frog jumped approximately 0.56 times. Since we can't have a fractional number of jumps, we'll round down to 0 jumps.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The park has a capacity of 991 spaces for cars to park.
2) The spaces are evenly distributed between 66 rows.
3) To find the number of spaces in each row, we divide the total number of spaces (991) by the number of rows (66):
991 Ã· 66 = 15.015
4) Since we can't have a fractional number of spaces, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 15 spaces per row.
5) Now, to find the number of spare spaces in the last row, we multiply the number of rows (66) by the number of spaces per row (15), which gives us 990 total spaces.
6) The total number of spaces (990) is less than the total capacity (991), so the number of spare spaces in the last row is 991 - 990 = 1.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work this out step-by-step:

1) The park has a capacity to hold 471 cars in each row.
2) We don't know the total number of rows, but we can calculate the number of spare spaces in the last row.

3) To do this, we first need to find the total number of spaces in the parking lot.
   * We know that each row can hold 471 cars.
   * So if we multiply 471 by the number of rows, we'll get the total number of spaces.

4) Let's say the number of rows is X.
   * Total number of spaces = 471 x X

5) We also know that the total capacity of the parking lot is 991 spaces.
   * 471 x X = 991

6) Solving for X, we get:
   * X = 991 / 471
   * X = 2.1 (rounded to 1 decimal place)

7) Since we can't have a fractional number of rows, we round down to 2 rows.

8) Now, the number of spare spaces in the last row would be:
   * 471 - (991 - (2 x 471)) = 1

To find the number of eggs left over in the last row, we need to:
1. Divide the total number of eggs (996) by the number of eggs per row (319) to find the number of complete rows.
2. Multiply the number of complete rows by the number of eggs per row to find the total number of eggs in the complete rows.
3. Subtract the total number of eggs in the complete rows from the total number of eggs to find the number of eggs left over.

Step 1: 996 Ã· 319 = 3.12 complete rows
Since we can't have a partial row, we round down to 3 complete rows.

1) There are 330 bales of hay to be stored.
2) Each barn can store up to 259 bales.
3) We need to fill up the barns as evenly as possible.

To find the number of bales left for the last barn, we first need to determine how many barns are needed.

We can do this by dividing the total number of bales (330) by the maximum capacity of each barn (259):
330 / 259 = 1.27

Since we can't have a fraction of a barn, we round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us 2 barns.

Now we can calculate how many bales will be in each of the 2 barns:
330 bales / 2 barns = 165 bales per barn

So the first 2 barns will each hold 165 bales.

Finally, to find the number of bales left for the last barn, we subtract the total number of bales in the first 2 barns from the total number of bales:
330 bales - (165 bales + 165 bales) = 0 bales

* The construction company is installing 166 windows on a building
* One installation team can install 137 windows per day
* The windows are equally distributed amongst teams each day

To find the number of windows that will remain for the team to install on the next day, we need to first find out how many windows can be installed in one day.

Since the windows are equally distributed amongst teams, we can divide the total number of windows (166) by the number of windows one team can install per day (137):
* 166 / 137 = 1.21 teams

This means that it will take approximately 2 teams to install all the windows.

Now, we can calculate the number of windows that will be installed on the first day:
* 137 windows per team x 2 teams = 274 windows

Finally, we can find the number of windows that will remain for the team to install on the next day:
* 166 total windows - 274 windows installed on the first day = -108 windows

Since we cannot have a negative number of windows remaining, we can conclude that all the windows will be installed on the first day, and there will be no windows left for the next day.

* There are 533 campers coming to the event
* Each tent can host 445 people

First, we need to find out how many tents are available. To do this, we divide the total number of campers by the capacity of each tent:

Since we can't have a fraction of a tent, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2 tents.

Now, we can calculate how many campers each tent can hold:
* 2 tents x 445 people per tent = 890 total campers

Finally, we can find the number of campers left over by subtracting the total campers that can be accommodated from the original 533 campers:
* 533 campers - 890 campers = -357 campers

Since we can't have a negative number of campers, this means that there will be 0 campers left over after all the tents are filled.

            In continuation of the previous scenario with seashells, imagine instead that there were initially only 234 seashells collected from the beach, but the souvenir sets are still made up of 474 shells each. How many shells would be left after attempting to form these sets?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:
1) There are 234 seashells collected from the beach.
2) Each beach-themed souvenir set contains 474 shells.
3) To find how many sets can be made, we divide the total number of shells (234) by the number of shells in each set (474):
234 Ã· 474 = 0.49 sets
4) Since we can't have a partial set, we round down to 0 complete sets.
5) Since no full sets can be made, all 234 shells will be left without a set.

* The tailor has 366 meters of fabric
* Each skirt requires 160 meters of fabric
* We need to find out how many skirts the tailor can make with the 366 meters of fabric, and then calculate the remaining fabric

First, let's find out how many skirts the tailor can make:
* 366 meters of fabric / 160 meters per skirt = 2.2875 skirts
* Since we can't make a fraction of a skirt, we round down to 2 skirts

1) The toymaker made 993 dolls
2) Each box can hold 327 dolls
3) We need to find out how many dolls will be left over once all the boxes are packed to their capacities

First, let's calculate how many boxes are needed to hold all 993 dolls:
* 993 dolls / 327 dolls per box = 3.04 boxes
* Since we can't have a fractional box, we need to round up to 4 boxes

Now, let's calculate how many dolls will be in the 4 boxes:
* 4 boxes x 327 dolls per box = 1,308 dolls

Finally, we can calculate the number of dolls left over:
* 993 dolls - 1,308 dolls = -315 dolls

Since we can't have a negative number of dolls, the answer is that there will be 0 dolls left over.

* Since we can't build a fraction of a fireplace, we'll round down to 0 fireplaces

Now, let's calculate the remaining bricks:
* 486 bricks - (0 fireplaces x 583 bricks per fireplace) = 486 bricks remaining

1) There are 984 roses in the castle's garden.
2) Princess likes to place 426 roses in every tribute for her loyal subjects.
3) We need to find out how many tributes she can create with the 984 roses, and how many roses will be left undistributed.

To do this, we can divide the total number of roses (984) by the number of roses in each tribute (426):
984 Ã· 426 = 2.31

Since we can't have a fractional number of tributes, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2.

So, the Princess can create 2 tributes, each with 426 roses.
2 tributes x 426 roses per tribute = 852 roses distributed.

Now, we can find the number of roses left undistributed by subtracting the number of roses distributed (852) from the total number of roses (984):
984 - 852 = 132 roses left undistributed.

2) The princess wants to use 730 roses for each tribute to her loyal subjects.

Since we can't have a fractional number of tributes, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1.

So, the Princess can create 1 tribute with 730 roses.
1 tribute x 730 roses per tribute = 730 roses distributed.

Now, we can find the number of roses left undistributed by subtracting the number of roses distributed (730) from the total number of roses (984):
984 - 730 = 254 roses left undistributed.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There were 513 centimeters of snowfall recorded this winter.
* The snowplow can clear up to 170 centimeters of snow at a time.
* We need to find how many centimeters of snow will be left over after the final pass.

First, we need to calculate how many times the snowplow will need to pass to clear all the snow:
* 513 cm / 170 cm per pass = 3.02 passes
* Since we can't have a fractional pass, we round up to 4 passes.

Now, we can calculate the amount of snow left over after the final pass:
* 513 cm - (3 passes * 170 cm) = 3 cm

1) The furniture factory has manufactured 380 chairs.
2) Each retail shop can only hold 310 chairs in its storage.
3) The factory needs to evenly distribute all the chairs to the shops.

To find the number of chairs left at the factory, we need to determine how many shops can receive the chairs, and then calculate the remaining chairs.

Let's start by finding how many shops can receive the chairs:
* 380 chairs / 310 chairs per shop = 1.226 shops
* Since we can't have a fractional number of shops, we round down to 1 shop.

Now we can calculate the number of chairs that will be distributed to the 1 shop:
* 1 shop x 310 chairs per shop = 310 chairs distributed

Finally, we can calculate the number of chairs left at the factory:
* 380 chairs manufactured - 310 chairs distributed = 70 chairs left at the factory

2) Each smaller distributor can only hold 143 chairs.

To find the number of chairs left at the factory, we need to determine how many smaller distributors can receive the chairs, and then calculate the remaining chairs.

Let's start by finding how many smaller distributors can receive the chairs:
* 380 chairs / 143 chairs per distributor = 2.66 distributors
* Since we can't have a fractional number of distributors, we round up to 3 distributors.

Now we can calculate the number of chairs that will be distributed to the 3 distributors:
* 3 distributors x 143 chairs per distributor = 429 chairs distributed

Finally, we can calculate the number of chairs left at the factory:
* 380 chairs manufactured - 429 chairs distributed = -49 chairs left at the factory

Since we can't have a negative number of chairs left, we know that the factory will not have any chairs left after distributing them evenly to the 3 smaller distributors.

* Since we can only consume full increments, the village can consume 1 increment of 385 units

First, let's calculate how many full increments of 920 units the village can consume from the 506 units generated:

* Since we can only consume full increments, the village can consume 0 increments of 920 units

To find how many energy units Blast Man will have left, we need to determine how many blasts he can fire using the 338 energy units.

We can do this by dividing the total energy units (338) by the energy used per blast (16):
* 338 / 16 = 21.125 blasts

Since he uses equal units of energy, we can round down to 21 blasts.

Now, we can calculate the remaining energy units by multiplying the number of blasts (21) by the energy used per blast (16), and subtracting that from the total energy units (338):
* 338 - (21 * 16) = 338 - 336 = 2

* Blast Man has 338 energy units in his power cells
* Each energy blast he fires now uses 46 energy units
* He uses equal units of energy firing blasts

To find how many energy units Blast Man will have left, we need to determine how many blasts he can fire using the 338 energy units.

We can do this by dividing the total energy units (338) by the energy used per blast (46):
* 338 / 46 = 7.348 blasts

Since he uses equal units of energy, we can round down to 7 blasts.

Now, we can calculate the remaining energy units by multiplying the number of blasts (7) by the energy used per blast (46), and subtracting that from the total energy units (338):
* 338 - (7 * 46) = 338 - 322 = 16

* The school district has 530 students who need to be transported
* Each school bus can carry 144 students
* The students are to be equally spread across the buses

To find the number of students on the last school bus, we first need to determine how many buses are needed to transport all 530 students.

We can do this by dividing the total number of students (530) by the capacity of each bus (144):
* 530 / 144 = 3.68 buses

Since we can't have a fractional number of buses, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means we will need 4 buses.

Now, to find the number of students on the last bus, we can take the remaining students after the first 3 buses are filled:
* 530 - (3 * 144) = 530 - 432 = 98 students

Therefore, the last school bus will have 98 students.

1) The company has produced 767 scooters.
2) Each delivery truck can carry 369 scooters.
3) We need to find out how many scooters will be left after all the trucks are loaded.

To do this, we need to find out how many trucks are needed to transport all 767 scooters.

We can do this by dividing the total number of scooters (767) by the capacity of each truck (369):
767 / 369 = 2.08 trucks

Since we can't have a fractional truck, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 trucks.

Now that we know how many trucks are needed, we can calculate how many scooters will be left over:
Total scooters: 767
Scooters per truck: 369
Number of trucks: 3
Total scooters transported: 369 x 3 = 1107

Scooters left over: 767 - 1107 = -340

However, since we can't have a negative number of scooters left over, the answer is 0.

5) Since we can't have a fractional raindrop, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 1 raindrop.
6) So the maximum number of raindrops that can be formed is 1.
7) Each raindrop requires 722 droplets, so the total number of droplets used to form the 1 raindrop is 722.
8) The number of droplets left unconverted in the cloud is the total droplets (846) minus the droplets used to form the raindrops (722):

4) To do this, we divide the total number of droplets (846) by the number of droplets needed per raindrop (442):

To find the number of unicorns in the last incomplete section, we need to first find the number of unicorns in each complete section.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1) The pirate ship initially had 462 cannonballs.
2) They want to distribute these 462 cannonballs evenly between 499 different crates.
3) To find how many cannonballs will be in each crate, we divide the total number of cannonballs (462) by the number of crates (499):
462 / 499 = 0.926
4) Since we can't have a fractional number of cannonballs per crate, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So each crate will get 0 cannonballs.
5) To find the total number of cannonballs that will be distributed into the crates, we multiply the number of crates (499) by the number of cannonballs per crate (0):
499 x 0 = 0
6) Finally, to find the number of cannonballs left uncrated, we subtract the total number of cannonballs distributed (0) from the original total (462):
462 - 0 = 462

* The dairy farm produces 913 gallons of milk in a day
* Each milk jug holds 39 gallons
* We need to find how many gallons will be left over after all the jugs are filled

First, we need to find out how many jugs can be filled with the 913 gallons of milk:
* 913 gallons / 39 gallons per jug = 23.41 jugs

Since we can't have a partial jug, we'll round down to 23 jugs.

Now, we can calculate the total gallons that will be used to fill the 23 jugs:

   850 beads / 631 beads per necklace = 1.35 necklaces
4) Since we can't make a partial necklace, we round down to 1 necklace.
5) So the jewelry maker can make 1 necklace using 631 beads.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 931 kids who want to use the swings.
2) Each swing set can accommodate 34 kids at a time.
3) We need to find out how many swing sets are needed to accommodate all 931 kids.
4) To do this, we divide 931 by 34: 931 / 34 = 27.38
5) Since we can't have a fraction of a swing set, we round up to 28 swing sets.
6) Each swing set can accommodate 34 kids, so the total number of kids that can be accommodated is 28 * 34 = 952.
7) The number of kids waiting for their turn is 931 - 952 = -21.

Since the result is negative, this means that there will be no kids waiting for their turn after all the swing sets are occupied. All 931 kids will be able to use the swings.

Now, we subtract the number of passengers transported in the first full trip from the total number of passengers to be transported:

1) The truck company has 514 boxes for delivery.
2) Each truck can hold up to 371 boxes.
3) We need to find out how many boxes will be left over if each truck is loaded to its full capacity.

To do this, we need to find out how many trucks are needed to transport all 514 boxes.

We can do this by dividing the total number of boxes (514) by the maximum capacity of each truck (371):
514 Ã· 371 = 1.38

Since we can't have a fractional number of trucks, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means we need 2 trucks to transport all 514 boxes.

Now, we can calculate the number of boxes that will be left over:
Total boxes: 514
Boxes transported by 2 trucks (2 x 371 = 742): 742
Boxes left over: 514 - 742 = -228

Since the result is negative, this means that there are no boxes left over. In fact, the 2 trucks can transport 228 more boxes than the 514 that are available.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1) The children created 533 sandcastles over the summer.
2) The sandcastles were grouped into sets of 230 for a photography contest.
3) To find the number of complete sets, we divide the total number of sandcastles (533) by the number of sandcastles in each set (230):
533 Ã· 230 = 2 complete sets with 73 sandcastles remaining.

4) Now we need to find the number of sandcastles that didn't form a complete set. To do this, we take the remaining 73 sandcastles.

1) The manufacturer has a production run of 735 toy cars.
2) The cars are packaged in packs of 348.
3) We need to find how many full packs can be filled, and how many cars will be left over.

To find the number of full packs:
* 735 toy cars / 348 cars per pack = 2.11 packs
* Since we can't have a partial pack, we round down to 2 full packs.

Now, to find the number of cars left over:
* 2 packs x 348 cars per pack = 696 cars

1) There are 386 animals in the forest.
2) Each woodlands territory can support 95 animals.
3) The animals are evenly distributed among the territories.

To find the number of animals left in the last not fully occupied territory, we need to:
1) Determine how many fully occupied territories there are.
2) Subtract the number of animals in the fully occupied territories from the total number of animals.
3) The remaining animals will be in the last not fully occupied territory.

Step 1: Determine how many fully occupied territories there are.
Number of fully occupied territories = 386 / 95 = 4 (with a remainder of 6)

Step 2: Subtract the number of animals in the fully occupied territories from the total number of animals.
Number of animals in the fully occupied territories = 4 * 95 = 380
Remaining animals = 386 - 380 = 6

4) To do this, we can divide the total length (934 meters) by the length of each piece (902 meters).
5) 934 meters / 902 meters per piece = 1.035 pieces
6) Since we can't have a fractional piece, we round down to the maximum whole number of pieces, which is 1.

   673 beads - (13 bracelets * 49 beads per bracelet) = 673 - 637 = 36 beads left over.

1) The jewelry maker now has a total of 673 beads.
2) She wants to make larger bracelets that use exactly 545 beads each.
3) To find the number of large bracelets she can make, we divide the total number of beads by the number of beads per bracelet:
   673 beads / 545 beads per bracelet = 1.23 bracelets
4) Since we can't make a partial bracelet, we round down to 1 bracelet.
5) To find the number of beads left over, we subtract the number of beads used for the 1 bracelet from the total number of beads:

* The police station received 927 calls within a week
* They have 311 operators who can handle the same number of calls each week
* We need to find how many calls the last operator will handle when the calls are divided equally

First, let's calculate the number of calls each operator can handle:
* 927 calls / 311 operators = 2.98 calls per operator

Since we can't have a fraction of a call, we'll round down to the nearest whole number:
* 2.98 calls per operator â‰ˆ 2 calls per operator

Now, we can calculate the total number of calls that can be handled by the first 310 operators:
* 310 operators x 2 calls per operator = 620 calls

Finally, we can calculate the number of calls the last operator will handle:
* 927 total calls - 620 calls handled by first 310 operators = 307 calls for the last operator

1) The company donated 639 sleeping bags.
2) Each campsite is supplied with 374 sleeping bags.
3) We need to find out how many sleeping bags will be left over after dividing the 639 sleeping bags equally among the campsites.

To do this, we first need to find out how many campsites there are. We can do this by dividing the total number of sleeping bags (639) by the number of sleeping bags per campsite (374):
* 639 / 374 = 1.71 campsites

Since we can't have a fraction of a campsite, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2 campsites.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sleeping bags that will be distributed to the 2 campsites:
* 2 campsites x 374 sleeping bags per campsite = 748 sleeping bags

Finally, we can calculate the number of sleeping bags left over by subtracting the total number of sleeping bags distributed (748) from the original number of sleeping bags donated (639):
* 639 - 748 = -109

1) Initially, there were 516 droplets in the cloud.
2) The cloud loses water droplets at an equal rate and becomes entirely dry after every 289 droplets.
3) To find the number of droplets left when the cloud is dry after the final cycle, we need to determine how many full cycles the cloud goes through before becoming entirely dry.

To do this, we can divide the initial number of droplets (516) by the number of droplets lost in each cycle (289):
516 / 289 = 1.78 cycles

Since we can't have a partial cycle, we round down to 1 full cycle.

This means the cloud will go through 1 full cycle, losing 289 droplets, leaving 516 - 289 = 227 droplets remaining.

            If initially, there were only 175 droplets in the cloud instead of 516. If the cloud loses water droplets at an equal rate and becomes entirely dry after every 289 droplets, how many droplets will be left when the cloud is dry after the final cycle?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Initially, there were 175 droplets in the cloud.
2) The cloud loses water droplets at an equal rate and becomes entirely dry after every 289 droplets.
3) To find the number of droplets left when the cloud is dry after the final cycle, we need to determine how many full cycles the cloud goes through before becoming entirely dry.

To do this, we can divide the initial number of droplets (175) by the number of droplets lost in each cycle (289):
175 / 289 = 0.605 cycles

Since we can't have a partial cycle, we round down to 0 full cycles.

This means the cloud will not go through any full cycles, so the remaining droplets will be the initial 175 droplets.

* The company has 258 shirts in production
* Each box can pack 67 shirts
* We need to find how many shirts would be left outside the boxes

First, let's find out how many boxes are needed to pack all the shirts:
* 258 shirts / 67 shirts per box = 3.85 boxes
* Since we can't have a fractional number of boxes, we need to round up to the nearest whole number
* So, 4 boxes are needed to pack all the shirts

Now, let's calculate how many shirts will be packed in the 4 boxes:
* 4 boxes x 67 shirts per box = 268 shirts

Finally, we can calculate how many shirts will be left outside the boxes:
* 258 shirts - 268 shirts = -10 shirts

### Answer: 0

Since the result is -10 shirts, this means that there are no shirts left outside the boxes. All 258 shirts are packed into the 4 boxes.</pre>

1) We have 995 gold coins that need to be divided among 267 pirates.
2) To divide the coins evenly, we need to find how many coins each pirate will get.
3) To do this, we divide the total number of coins (995) by the number of pirates (267):
995 Ã· 267 = 3.73 coins per pirate
4) Since we can't have a fraction of a coin, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3 coins per pirate.
5) Now we need to find out how many coins are left over after dividing the 995 coins evenly among the 267 pirates.
6) To do this, we multiply the number of pirates (267) by the number of coins each pirate gets (3), which gives us 267 x 3 = 801 coins.
7) We then subtract the 801 coins from the total of 995 coins, which gives us 995 - 801 = 194 coins left over.

            John has collected 365 coins. He decided to put equal numbers of them in his 140 wallets. However, he found out he would still have some coins left after evenly distributing them into these wallets. How many coins will John have left?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John has 365 coins
* He wants to put equal numbers of them in 140 wallets
* We need to find out how many coins will be left over after the even distribution

First, let's calculate how many coins would go into each wallet if they were distributed evenly:
* 365 coins / 140 wallets = 2.61 coins per wallet

Since we can't have a fractional number of coins per wallet, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2 coins per wallet.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins that would be distributed into the 140 wallets:
* 2 coins per wallet x 140 wallets = 280 coins distributed

Finally, we can calculate the number of coins that will be left over:
* 365 total coins - 280 coins distributed = 85 coins left over

* John now has 739 coins
* He wants to distribute them evenly among his 140 wallets

First, let's calculate how many coins would go into each wallet if they were distributed evenly:
* 739 coins / 140 wallets = 5.28 coins per wallet

Since we can't have a fractional number of coins per wallet, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, which is 5 coins per wallet.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins that would be distributed into the 140 wallets:
* 5 coins per wallet x 140 wallets = 700 coins distributed

To do this, we first need to find out how many cartons can be filled:

So, 4 cartons can be filled with 4 * 179 = 716 socks.

4) To do this, we divide the total number of cards (569) by the number of cards in each pack (68):
569 Ã· 68 = 8.37 packs
5) Since we can't have a fractional number of packs, we round down to 8 full packs.
6) Each pack has 68 cards, so 8 packs would be 8 * 68 = 544 cards.
7) The total number of cards created was 569, and the number of cards in the 8 full packs is 544.

4) To do this, we divide the total number of cards (205) by the number of cards in each pack (68):
205 Ã· 68 = 3.01 packs
5) Since we can't have a fractional number of packs, we round down to 3 full packs.

Since we can't have a partial box, we round down to 1 full box.

Now, to find the number of carrots left unpacked, we subtract the number of carrots in the full box from the total number of carrots:
461 carrots - (1 box * 244 carrots per box) = 461 - 244 = 217 carrots

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The farmer actually harvested 11 carrots, not 461 as initially stated.
2) Each box can hold up to 244 carrots.
3) We need to find how many full boxes the farmer can pack, and how many carrots will be left unpacked.

To find the number of full boxes, we can divide the total number of carrots by the capacity of each box:
11 carrots / 244 carrots per box = 0.045 boxes

Since we can't have a partial box, we round down to 0 full boxes.

Now, to find the number of carrots left unpacked, we simply take the total number of carrots:
11 carrots

1) The scientist counted 309 penguins in the colony.
2) She decides to tag them in groups of 293.
3) To find the number of penguins in the final, possibly incomplete, group, we need to find the remainder when 309 is divided by 293.

309 / 293 = 1 with a remainder of 16.

* The sandwich shop has 580 slices of bread
* They use 18 slices of bread for each sandwich-making batch
* We need to find out how many slices will be left after using up the bread in these batches

First, let's calculate how many batches they can make with 580 slices of bread:
* 580 slices / 18 slices per batch = 32.22 batches
* Since we can't have a fractional batch, we'll round down to 32 batches

Now, we can calculate the total number of slices used in the 32 batches:
* 32 batches x 18 slices per batch = 576 slices used

Finally, we can calculate the number of slices left:
* 580 slices - 576 slices used = 4 slices left

1) The tailor has 925 meters of fabric.
2) The tailor uses 529 meters of fabric to make each dress.
3) The tailor uses the fabric evenly for each dress.

To find the amount of fabric left over, we need to calculate how many dresses the tailor can make with the 925 meters of fabric, and then subtract that from the total amount of fabric.

The number of dresses the tailor can make is:
925 meters / 529 meters per dress = 1.75 dresses

Since the tailor uses the fabric evenly, we can round down to 1 dress.

So the amount of fabric left over is:
925 meters - (1 dress * 529 meters per dress) = 396 meters
