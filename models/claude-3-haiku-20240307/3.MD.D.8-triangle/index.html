        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) An equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length.
2) The perimeter of a shape is the total distance around the shape.
3) For an equilateral triangle, the perimeter is 3 times the length of one side.
4) So, if the perimeter is 990cm, we can set up the equation:
3 * x = 990
5) Solving for x, we get:
x = 990/3
6) Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 330cm.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The perimeter of the triangle is 997m
* Two of the sides have lengths of 2m and 667m
* We need to find the length of the third side

To find the length of the third side, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:
Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3

Plugging in the known values:
997 = 2 + 667 + Side 3
997 = 669 + Side 3
Side 3 = 997 - 669
Side 3 = 328m

        <pre class="model-raw-response">To solve this problem, we need to find the length of each side of the equilateral triangle given the total perimeter.

Given information:
- The total perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 405 cm.

Step 1: Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle.
In an equilateral triangle, all three sides have the same length.

Step 2: Set up an equation to find the length of each side.
Let the length of each side be x.
Total perimeter = 3 Ã— x
405 = 3 Ã— x

Step 3: Solve for the length of each side.
405 = 3 Ã— x
x = 405 / 3
x = 135 cm

Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 135 cm.

Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3
4) Plugging in the values we know:
828 = 105 + 434 + Side 3
5) Solving for Side 3:
828 = 539 + Side 3
Side 3 = 828 - 539
Side 3 = 289 meters

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) An equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length.
2) The perimeter of a shape is the total distance around the shape.
3) For an equilateral triangle, the perimeter is 3 times the length of one side.
4) So, if the perimeter is 714m, we can set up the equation:
   3 * x = 714
   Where x is the length of one side.
5) Solving for x, we get:
   x = 714 / 3
   x = 238m

3x = 195
6) Solving for x, we get:
x = 195/3
7) Therefore, the length of each side is 65cm.

* The perimeter of the triangle is 919m
* One side is 350m long
* Another side is 154m long

* The triangle has a perimeter of 804m

To find the length of the third side, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:
Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3

We know the perimeter is 804m, and we know the lengths of two of the sides (262m and 90m). So we can plug these values into the formula and solve for the third side:
804m = 262m + 90m + Side 3

1) We are given a scalene triangle, which means all three sides are of different lengths.
2) The total perimeter of the triangle is 573m.
3) One side measures 103m and another side measures 386m.
4) To find the length of the third side, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:

1) An equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length.
2) The perimeter of a shape is the total distance around the shape.
3) For an equilateral triangle, the perimeter is 3 times the length of one side.
4) So, if the perimeter is 330m, we can set up the equation:

* The triangle has a perimeter of 499m
* The largest side is 259m long
* One of the other sides is 11m long

To find the length of the last side, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:
Perimeter = Length of side 1 + Length of side 2 + Length of side 3

We know the perimeter is 499m, and we know the lengths of two of the sides (259m and 11m). So we can plug these values into the formula and solve for the length of the last side:

499m = 259m + 11m + Length of last side
499m = 270m + Length of last side
Length of last side = 499m - 270m
Length of last side = 229m

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) An equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length.
2) The perimeter of a shape is the total distance around the shape.
3) For an equilateral triangle, the perimeter is 3 times the length of one side.
4) So, if the perimeter is 966m, we can set up the equation:
   3 * x = 966
   Where x is the length of one side.
5) Solving for x, we get:
   x = 966 / 3
   x = 322m

Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 322 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We know the total perimeter of the triangle is 678 feet.
2) Two of the sides measure 419 feet and 164 feet.
3) To find the length of the third side, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:
Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3
678 = 419 + 164 + Side 3
Side 3 = 678 - 419 - 164
Side 3 = 95 feet

* The perimeter of the triangle is 248m
* Two of the sides are 186m and 37m long
* We need to find the length of the remaining side

To find the length of the remaining side, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:
Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3

Plugging in the values we have:
248m = 186m + 37m + Side 3

Solving for Side 3:
248m = 223m + Side 3
Side 3 = 248m - 223m

* The triangular garden has one side that is 325 meters long and another that is 15 meters long.
* The total perimeter of the triangle is 633 meters.

To find the length of the third side, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:
Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3

We know that:
* Side 1 = 325 meters
* Side 2 = 15 meters
* Perimeter = 633 meters

5) Solving for x, we get:
   x = 69/3
   x = 23m

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given a triangle with two sides of lengths 464m and 377m.
2) The total perimeter of the triangle is 907m.
3) To find the length of the third side, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle:
Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3
4) Plugging in the values we have:
907 = 464 + 377 + Side 3
5) Solving for Side 3:
907 = 841 + Side 3
Side 3 = 907 - 841
Side 3 = 66m

            An equilateral triangle has a perimeter of 966m. What is the length of each of its sides?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) An equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length.
2) The perimeter of a shape is the total distance around the shape.
3) For an equilateral triangle, the perimeter is 3 times the length of one side.
4) So, if the perimeter is 966m, we can set up the equation:
   3 * x = 966
   Where x is the length of one side.
5) Solving for x, we get:
   x = 966 / 3
   x = 322m

Therefore, the length of each side of the equilateral triangle is 322 meters.
