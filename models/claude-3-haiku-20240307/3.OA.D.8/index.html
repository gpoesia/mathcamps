        A chocolate factory initially had 33 chocolate bars. However, 6 of them were given away as samples to customers. Then, 3 of them were used for a quality control testing. How many chocolate bars are left in the factory?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The chocolate factory initially had 33 chocolate bars.
2. 6 of them were given away as samples to customers.
   * So, the number of chocolate bars left after the samples were given away is 33 - 6 = 27.
3. Then, 3 of the remaining chocolate bars were used for quality control testing.
   * So, the number of chocolate bars left after the quality control testing is 27 - 3 = 24.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The chocolate factory had 24 chocolate bars remaining after the samples and quality control testing.
2. The factory decided to match the number of remaining chocolate bars by producing new ones.
3. This means they produced an additional 24 chocolate bars to match the 24 remaining.

Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars at the factory now is:
* 24 (remaining from before) + 24 (new ones produced) = 48 chocolate bars

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:
1. The chocolate factory initially had 17 chocolate bars.
2. 6 of them were given away as samples to customers.
   * So, the number of chocolate bars left after the samples were given away is 17 - 6 = 11.
3. Then, 3 of the remaining chocolate bars were used for quality control testing.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The recipe calls for 1 tablespoon of salt per meal
* The chef needs to prepare 30 identical meals
* The chef also needs to prepare an extra meal for tasting purposes
* So the total number of meals is 30 + 1 = 31

To calculate the total amount of salt needed, we multiply the number of meals by the amount of salt per meal:
* 31 meals x 1 tablespoon of salt per meal = 31 tablespoons of salt

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The chef prepared a total of 31 meals
* Each meal required 1 tablespoon of salt
* So the total amount of salt used for the 31 meals is:
  * 31 meals x 1 tablespoon of salt per meal = 31 tablespoons of salt used

Now, we need to find out how much salt is left in the container:
* The container originally had 60 tablespoons of salt
* The chef used 31 tablespoons of salt
* So the amount of salt left in the container is:
  * 60 tablespoons - 31 tablespoons = 29 tablespoons

* To find the number of pairs you have left, we need to subtract the number of pairs sold from the total number of pairs you started with.
* 48 pairs - 45 pairs sold = &lt;&lt;48 - 45 = 3&gt;&gt; 3 pairs of earrings left in your collection.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The player just earned 12 XP points.
2) To level up, the player needs a total of 73 XP points plus the initial amount they just earned.
3) So the total XP points needed to level up is 73 + 12 = 85 XP points.
4) The player already has 12 XP points, so the remaining XP points needed to level up is 85 - 12 = 73 XP points.

        A carpenter needs to make some tables. He initially has 78 boards of wood but uses 73 to prepare for the construction. He later realizes he has 99 potential orders but the current boards of wood he has are not enough to meet this demand. How many additional boards does he need to perfectly meet all the orders?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The carpenter initially has 78 boards of wood.
2. He uses 73 of those boards to prepare for the construction.
3. This means he has 78 - 73 = 5 boards of wood remaining.
4. He later realizes he has 99 potential orders.
5. The 5 boards of wood he has remaining are not enough to meet the 99 orders.
6. To calculate the additional boards he needs, we take the number of orders (99) and subtract the number of boards he has remaining (5).
7. 99 - 5 = 94 additional boards of wood needed.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. In the previous problem, the carpenter had 5 boards of wood remaining.
2. He can make 1 table per board of wood.
3. So with the 5 boards of wood he has, he can make 5 tables.
4. However, he can only afford to make 14 tables due to other limitations.
5. So the difference between the number of tables he can make (5) and the number of tables he can afford to make (14) is:
14 - 5 = 9 less tables.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The astronomer initially counted 1 star in a small area of the sky.
2. Then, 5 more stars gradually became visible as his eyes adjusted to the darkness.
   * So the total number of stars at this point is 1 + 5 = 6.
3. After an hour, a meteor shower began and he spotted 28 more stars.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The hostel originally had 75 beds.
Over time, 55 of them became old and were removed for refurbishment.
To find the number of beds currently available in the hostel, we need to subtract the number of beds removed from the original number of beds.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Originally, there were 75 beds in the hostel.
2) 55 of the beds became old and were removed for refurbishment.
3) This left 75 - 55 = 20 beds remaining.
4) The number of new beds donated by the sponsor plus the remaining 20 beds equals the original 75 beds.

To find the number of beds donated by the sponsor, we can use the equation:
New beds donated + 20 remaining beds = 75 original beds
New beds donated = 75 - 20 = &lt;&lt;75 - 20 = 55&gt;&gt;55 beds

The new toy car costs 61 toy cars for a trade.
To determine if Tommy has enough toy cars left to trade for the new one, we compare the number of toy cars he has left (48) to the number required for the trade (61).
48 &lt; 61, so Tommy does not have enough toy cars left to trade for the new one.
To find how many more toy cars he needs, we subtract the number of toy cars he has left (48) from the number required for the trade (61).

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The wizard originally had 53 magical artifacts.
He gave out 12 of them to apprentice wizards, so he had 53 - 12 = 41 artifacts left.
He then discovered an additional 4 artifacts in a hidden chamber.
To find the total number of artifacts he has now, we add the 4 newly discovered artifacts to the 41 he had left after giving out the 12.
41 + 4 = &lt;&lt;41 + 4 = 45&gt;&gt;45

* So, the number of good windows left = 41 - 21 = 20
* The factory received an urgent order for 86 windows
* To fulfill the order, the factory needs to produce 86 windows

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The school starts with 19 students
* During the next intake, they enroll an equal number of new students

To find the total number of students now, we need to add the number of new students to the original 19 students.

Let's call the number of new students that were enrolled 'x'.

Since the school enrolled an equal number of new students, we can say that the total number of students now is 19 + x.

We don't know the exact value of 'x', but we do know that the total number of students is an even number, since the new students were enrolled in an equal number.

Therefore, 19 + x must be an even number.

The closest even number to 19 is 20, so we can conclude that x = 1.

Therefore, the total number of students in the school now is:
19 + 1 = 20

2) Originally, there were 72 bees in the cluster of trees.

3) After some time, the number of bees in the cluster of trees equals the number of bees in the field subtracted from the original number in the cluster.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Initially, there were 91 kites available
* After the festival started, there were 80 kites remaining (48 small kites and 32 large kites)

* The second booth initially had 59 kites
* The second booth sold the same number of kites as the number of kites remaining from the initial batch of 91 kites, which is 80 kites
* Therefore, the second booth had 59 - 80 = -21 kites left after these sales

However, this doesn't make sense, as the second booth cannot have a negative number of kites left. Let's re-examine the problem.

The correct solution is:
* The second booth initially had 59 kites
* They sold the same number of kites as the number of kites sold before the festival started, which is 11 kites
* Therefore, the second booth had 59 - 11 = 48 kites left after these sales

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 77 animals in total on the farm
* Some of the animals are cows, and the rest are chickens
* The number of chickens is 53 less than the total number of animals

To find the number of chickens, we can use the following equation:
* Number of chickens = Total number of animals - 53

Now, we can subtract the 30 candles that are on sale from the total:
* Candles not on sale = 100 - 30 = 70 candles

The clothing store started the day with 95 pairs of pants in stock.

So, the number of pairs of pants left in the store after the sales was 95 - 4 = 91 pairs.
The store then received a small shipment of 3 more pairs to restock.
To find the total number of pairs of pants now in the store, we need to add the 3 new pairs to the 91 pairs that were left.
91 pairs + 3 new pairs = 94 pairs of pants now in the store.
