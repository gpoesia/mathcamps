* Harvey has a total of 70 roller skates in his shop
* 42 of those roller skates are for children
* To find the number of roller skates for adults, we need to subtract the number of children's roller skates from the total number of roller skates

Calculation:
* Total roller skates: 70
* Children's roller skates: 42
* Adult roller skates = Total roller skates - Children's roller skates
* Adult roller skates = 70 - 42 = 28

* Sam originally had 22 strings for his kites
* He then added some more strings to his collection

To find out how many extra strings Sam added, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of strings he ended up with (41) and the original number of strings he had (22).

* John spends 7 hours working on the puzzle initially
* He then takes an additional amount of time 'b' to finish the puzzle completely
* Altogether, he spends 13 hours working on the puzzle

We can set up an equation to solve for the additional time 'b':
* Total time = Initial time + Additional time
* 13 hours = 7 hours + b

Solving for b:
* 13 hours - 7 hours = b
* 6 hours = b

Therefore, John spends an additional 6 hours to finish the puzzle completely.

* The bear's goal is to eat 92 pounds of food
* The bear has already eaten 89 pounds of food
* We need to find how much more food 't' the bear needs to eat to reach its goal of 92 pounds

To find the amount of food 't' the bear needs to eat, we can subtract the amount of food it has already eaten (89 pounds) from its goal (92 pounds):

To find the number of jewels the subject found and presented to the princess, we need to subtract the original 14 jewels from the total 49 jewels.

* Initially, there were 83 trees in the forest.
* After the storm, the number of trees was reduced to 12.
* To find the number of trees that were uprooted, we need to subtract the final number of trees (12) from the initial number of trees (83).

83 trees - 12 trees = 71 trees

Let's represent the number of romantic songs as x.
* Total songs = 40
* Romantic songs = x
* Remaining songs = 40 - x

The question states that the remaining songs after subtracting the romantic songs is 20.
* 40 - x = 20

* The shop started with 'a' number of sleeping bags
* They sold 36 sleeping bags
* They are left with 35 sleeping bags

We can use this information to find the original number of sleeping bags 'a'.

Let's represent the original number of sleeping bags as 'a'.
After selling 36 sleeping bags, the remaining number of sleeping bags is 35.

So, we can write this as an equation:
a - 36 = 35

Solving for 'a':
a - 36 = 35
a = 35 + 36
a = 71

Therefore, the original number of sleeping bags in the shop was 71.

* The store has 41 beach balls in total
* 15 of the beach balls are blue
* We need to find out how many of the beach balls are green

To find the number of green beach balls, we can subtract the number of blue beach balls from the total number of beach balls:
* Total beach balls = 41
* Blue beach balls = 15
* Green beach balls = Total beach balls - Blue beach balls
* Green beach balls = 41 - 15 = 26

1) John initially had 65% of his mobile phone battery left.
2) After playing a game, the battery level decreased to 20%.
3) To find the battery percentage consumed by the game, we need to subtract the final battery percentage from the initial battery percentage.

* The teacher initially had 'a' sheets of special star stickers in her drawer.
* She then used 60 stickers for rewarding her students in class.
* Now she has only 2 sheets left.

We can set up an equation to solve for the initial number of sheets 'a':
* Initial number of sheets: 'a'
* Stickers used: 60
* Remaining sheets: 2

We know that each sheet has a certain number of stickers, let's call that number 'x'.
* Initial number of stickers: 'a' x 'x'
* Stickers used: 60
* Remaining stickers: 2 x 'x'

We can write the equation:
* 'a' x 'x' - 60 = 2 x 'x'

Solving for 'a':
* 'a' x 'x' - 60 = 2 x 'x'
* 'a' x 'x' = 2 x 'x' + 60
* 'a' = (2 x 'x' + 60) / 'x'

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total length of the blanket is 96 inches
* 39 inches of this length is covered in a decorative border
* To find the length of the main part of the blanket, we need to subtract the length of the border from the total length of the blanket

Calculation:
* Total length of the blanket: 96 inches
* Length of the border: 39 inches
* Length of the main part of the blanket = Total length - Length of border
* Length of the main part of the blanket = 96 inches - 39 inches = 57 inches

* Ronnie has a total of 77 pairs of socks
* Out of these, 52 pairs are white
* To find the number of non-white socks, we need to subtract the number of white socks from the total number of socks

So, the calculation is:
* Total socks = 77 pairs
* White socks = 52 pairs
* Non-white socks = Total socks - White socks
* Non-white socks = 77 - 52 = 25 pairs
