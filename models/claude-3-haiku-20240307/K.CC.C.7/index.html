When comparing two numbers, the following rules apply:

- If the first number is greater than the second number, we use the greater than symbol (&gt;).
- If the two numbers are equal, we use the equal to symbol (=).

In this case, 1 is less than 7, so the correct symbol to use is the less than symbol (&lt;).

In this case, we have the numbers 6 and 7 to compare.

Applying the same rules as before:
- If the first number is less than the second number, we use the less than symbol (&lt;).
- If the first number is greater than the second number, we use the greater than symbol (&gt;).
- If the two numbers are equal, we use the equal to symbol (=).

Since 6 is less than 7, the correct symbol to use is the less than symbol (&lt;).

Now, the new values are 5 and 5.

To correctly indicate the comparison of these two numbers, we need to use the appropriate operation from the given choices: &lt;, &gt;, or =.

Since 5 is equal to 5, the correct operation to use is =.

Therefore, the expression should be:

5 = 5

The relationship has changed from the previous problem, where the comparison was 4 &lt; 5. Now, the comparison is 5 = 5, since the two numbers are equal.

In the previous question, we compared 1 and 7, and determined that 1 is less than 7.

Now, we are comparing 5 and 7.

Since 5 is a larger number than 1, and 7 is still the same number, we can conclude that 5 is greater than 1, but less than 7.

Therefore, the correct symbol to fill in the blank is &lt;.

5 &lt; 7

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous problem, you compared the numbers 6 and 8. Now consider a similar comparison:

Compare these two numbers by filling in the blank with &lt;, &gt;, or =: 
9 _ 8

            Fill in the blank in the question 
8 _ 7

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The question is asking us to fill in the blank in the expression &quot;8 _ 7&quot; with either a &lt;, &gt;, or = sign to compare the numbers.
2) To compare the numbers 8 and 7, we need to determine which one is greater.
3) 8 is greater than 7, so the correct sign to fill in the blank is &gt;.
4) The completed expression is: 8 &gt; 7.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            In the previous statement, you compared the numbers 8 and 7. Now consider a different scenario: 

Fill in the blank in the statement 
5 _ 7
with either a &lt;, &gt;, or = sign to compare the numbers. How does this comparison differ from the earlier one?

4) The completed expression is: 5 &lt; 7.

The comparison in this scenario differs from the earlier one because:
- In the earlier scenario, we compared 8 and 7, and 8 is greater than 7, so the correct sign was &gt;.
- In this scenario, we are comparing 5 and 7, and 5 is less than 7, so the correct sign is &lt;.
