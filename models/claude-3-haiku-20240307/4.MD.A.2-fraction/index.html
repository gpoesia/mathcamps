        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Steve started with $38 and spent it evenly over 8 days.
   * That means he spent $38 / 8 = $4.75 per day.

2. Steve then received an extra $11.
   * So Steve now has $38 + $11 = $49.

3. John started with $18 and spent the same amount as Steve, which is $4.75 per day.
   * John spent $4.75 x 8 days = $38.

4. John then found $25 on the street.
   * So John now has $18 - $38 + $25 = $5.

To calculate the total amount of money John has, we need to add the $17 in his bank account to the value of the loose change.

The value of the loose change is $8/37.

Now, we can add the two amounts together:
$17 + $8/37 = $17 + $0.21621621621621621621621621621622

1) John currently has $17.21621621621621621621621621621622 in total.
2) He earns $22 per task.
3) He completes a number of tasks equal to the total money he currently has.

To calculate the total money he will have after completing the tasks, we need to:
1) Calculate how many tasks he will complete, which is equal to his current total money.
2) Multiply the number of tasks by the amount he earns per task ($22).
3) Add the amount he earns from the tasks to his current total money.

Step 1: Number of tasks = $17.21621621621621621621621621621622
Step 2: Amount earned from tasks = $17.21621621621621621621621621621622 * $22 = $378.75
Step 3: Total money after completing tasks = $17.21621621621621621621621621621622 + $378.75 = $395.96621621621621621621621621621622

1) John initially thought he had $17 in his bank account, but he actually has $7.
2) He still has the same amount of loose change amounting to $8/37 on his desk.

To calculate the new total amount of money John has, we need to add the $7 in his bank account to the value of the loose change.

The value of the loose change is $8/37.

Now, we can add the two amounts together:
$7 + $8/37 = $7 + $0.21621621621621621621621621621622

1. Initially, Sally travels 47/50 of a mile.
2. Then, she rides another 31 miles.
3. For the next 28 days, she completes the same distance as the previous day.

To find the total distance traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each step and then add them together.

Step 1: 47/50 of a mile
Step 2: 31 miles
Step 3: 28 days x (47/50 + 31) miles = 28 x (47/50 + 31) miles

Now, we add the extra 32/24 miles that she added to her regular bike route.

Total distance traveled = 47/50 + 31 + 28 x (47/50 + 31) + 32/24
= 47/50 + 31 + 28 x (78/50) + 32/24
= 47/50 + 31 + 2184/50 + 32/24

2. The energy drink increased his speed by 50/49 miles per hour.

3. So, his new speed after the energy drink would be:

3) To calculate the total amount of money he now has, we need to add the initial $6 and the additional 47/8 dollars.

47/8 dollars = $5.875

So, the total amount of money John now has is:
$6 + $5.875 = $11.875

1) John's house is (17 / 3) miles from his work.
2) The supermarket is (25 / 41) miles closer to his work than his house.
3) To find the distance from the supermarket to his work, we need to subtract the distance from the supermarket to his house from the distance from his house to his work.
4) The distance from the supermarket to his house is (25 / 41) miles.
5) The distance from his house to his work is (17 / 3) miles.
6) So the distance from the supermarket to his work is (17 / 3) - (25 / 41) miles.

To calculate this, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions:
(17 * 41) / (3 * 41) - (25 * 3) / (41 * 3)

2) To find the square of this distance, we simply need to square the distance:

(622/123)^2

3) To calculate this, we can first square the numerator and denominator separately:

Numerator: 622^2 = 386,884
Denominator: 123^2 = 15,129

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The video game costs $40, and John already has $29.
2. John needs to save the remaining $40 - $29 = $11.
3. Every week, John is able to save 20/48 of the money he needs, which is 20/48 * $11 = $4.58.
4. After a certain period of time, John decides to put all his savings so far into an investment account.
5. The account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested after a year.

Now, let's calculate how much money John will have in his investment account after a year:
* John saves $4.58 per week.
* Let's say it takes him 3 weeks to save the $11 he needs.
* So, the total amount he invests is 3 * $4.58 = $13.74.
* The account promises a return of 41/11 times the money invested, which is 41/11 * $13.74 = $51.18.

1) Maria starts with 13/3 euros in her pocket.
2) She buys a candy bar that costs 32/15 euros.
3) To find how much money she has left, we need to subtract the cost of the candy bar from the amount of money she started with.

First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator:
13/3 = 39/9
32/15 = 48/15

Now we can subtract:
39/9 - 48/15 = (39*15 - 48*9) / (9*15)
= (585 - 432) / 135
= 153 / 135

* The carpenter cuts a piece of lumber into pieces that are each 45/44 meters long.
* We need to find the total length of 20 pieces of such lumber.

To calculate the total length, we need to:
1. Find the length of one piece of lumber.
2. Multiply the length of one piece by the number of pieces (20).

Step 1: Finding the length of one piece of lumber.
* The length of each piece is 45/44 meters.

Step 2: Calculating the total length of 20 pieces.
* Total length = Length of one piece Ã— Number of pieces
* Total length = 45/44 meters Ã— 20

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

First part:
* Speed = 34 miles / 14 hours
* Speed = 34/14 = 2.43 miles per hour

Second part:
* Speed = 21 miles / 26 hours
* Speed = 21/26 = 0.81 miles per hour

Now, we need to find the total distance covered in one hour from both parts together.

Total distance covered in one hour = Distance from first part + Distance from second part
Total distance covered in one hour = (2.43 miles/hour) + (0.81 miles/hour)
Total distance covered in one hour = 3.24 miles

1) Jenny ran for 41/32 miles in the first round.
2) After a break, she ran for another 11/4 miles.
3) To find the total miles she ran, we need to add the two distances together.

Converting the fractions to a common denominator:
41/32 = (41 * 4) / (32 * 4) = 164/128
11/4 = (11 * 32) / (4 * 32) = 352/128

Now we can add the two distances:
164/128 + 352/128 = 516/128

To simplify the final answer, we can convert the fraction to a mixed number:

1) Jenny drove for a total of 29 hours at a speed of 32/24 miles per hour.
2) To find the distance she traveled, we multiply the time (29 hours) by the speed (32/24 miles per hour):
   Distance = Time Ã— Speed
   Distance = 29 hours Ã— (32/24) miles per hour
   Distance = 29 Ã— (32/24) miles
   Distance = 38.67 miles

3) Now, her speed is increased by a factor of 43/15.
   New Speed = (32/24) Ã— (43/15) miles per hour
   New Speed = 46.22 miles per hour

4) To find the new distance she could travel, we multiply the new speed by the same time of 29 hours:

2. Multiply that amount by the number of children

Step 1: Amount of paint per child
* Each child received 16/31 litres of paint

Step 2: Total amount of paint distributed
* Total paint = Amount per child x Number of children
* Total paint = 16/31 litres x 32 children
* Total paint = (16 x 32) / 31 litres
* Total paint = 512 / 31 litres

2) The second rock was moved for an interval of 45/36 hours.
3) Tom can move rocks at a speed of 25/22 miles per hour.

To find the total distance moved, we need to calculate the distance for each rock and then add them together.

For the first rock:
* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = (25/22) miles/hour x (20/50) hours
* Distance = (25/22) x (20/50) miles
* Distance = 5/22 miles

For the second rock: 
* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = (25/22) miles/hour x (45/36) hours
* Distance = (25/22) x (45/36) miles
* Distance = 25/16 miles

Total distance moved:
* Total distance = Distance of first rock + Distance of second rock
* Total distance = (5/22) miles + (25/16) miles
* Total distance = (5/22 + 25/16) miles

1. The first container has 23/35 gallon of juice.
2. The second container has 50/41 gallon of juice.
3. We mix the two containers together.
4. The total amount of juice is 23/35 + 50/41 gallons.
5. To find the total amount of juice, we need to find the common denominator. The least common denominator of 35 and 41 is 1435.
6. 23/35 = 660/1435 gallons
7. 50/41 = 1220/1435 gallons
8. The total amount of juice is 660/1435 + 1220/1435 = 1880/1435 gallons.
9. The bottle can hold 28 gallons.
10. 11/19 gallon was drunk by a customer.

* For a custom design, there is an additional fee of $6 divided by the 26 available designs
* To calculate the additional fee for the custom design:

1. The drone can fly 3 kilometers without any package or booster.
2. When carrying a delivery package, the drone can only fly 50/43 kilometers less than the original 3 kilometers.
   * So, the distance the drone can fly with the package is 3 - (50/43) = 3 - 1.16 = 1.84 kilometers.
3. When the drone is attached with an additional booster, it can fly an additional 47/15 kilometers.

1. Alex has $13/10 in his pocket.
2. He finds $47/36 on the floor and picks it up, adding it to the money he already has.

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Richard bought a bottle of wine with 33 ounces.
2. He drank 33/48 of the wine.
   * To find the amount of wine he drank, we multiply 33 by 33/48:
   * 33 * (33/48) = 22.75 ounces of wine

3. In the morning, he drank a cup of orange juice that contained 26/30 of a liter.
   * To convert 26/30 of a liter to ounces, we first need to convert it to milliliters:
   * 26/30 of a liter = 26/30 * 1000 = 866.67 milliliters
   * 866.67 milliliters = 866.67/29.57 = 29.33 ounces of orange juice

4. After a few hours, he drank a bottle of water that contained 2/36 of a liter.
   * To convert 2/36 of a liter to ounces, we first need to convert it to milliliters:
   * 2/36 of a liter = 2/36 * 1000 = 55.56 milliliters
   * 55.56 milliliters = 55.56/29.57 = 1.88 ounces of water

5. To find the total volume of liquid consumed, we add up the amounts:
   * 22.75 ounces of wine + 29.33 ounces of orange juice + 1.88 ounces of water = 53.96 ounces

1) John buys 17 pounds of apples every 8 days.
2) John consumes 48 ounces of apple juice every 42 days.
3) We need to find the rate of John's apple to apple juice consumption.

First, let's convert the apple weight to ounces:
* 17 pounds = 17 * 16 = 272 ounces

Now, let's find the rate of apple consumption:
* 272 ounces of apples every 8 days
* Rate of apple consumption = 272 ounces / 8 days = 34 ounces per day

Next, let's find the rate of apple juice consumption:
* 48 ounces of apple juice every 42 days
* Rate of apple juice consumption = 48 ounces / 42 days = 1.14 ounces per day

Finally, to find the rate of apple to apple juice consumption, we divide the rate of apple consumption by the rate of apple juice consumption:
* Rate of apple to apple juice consumption = 34 ounces per day / 1.14 ounces per day = 29.82

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Maria drove her car for 8 hours at a speed of 4/7 miles per hour.
   * To find the total miles driven, we multiply the speed by the time:
   * Speed = 4/7 miles per hour
   * Time = 8 hours
   * Total miles driven = 4/7 * 8 = 32/7 miles

2. In another trip, Maria initially had $38 for gas but spent 50/4 dollars on gas.
   * Amount spent on gas = 50/4 = $12.50
   * Remaining amount of money for gas = $38 - $12.50 = $25.50

3. Summation of the total miles driven and the remaining amount of money for gas:
   * Total miles driven = 32/7 miles
   * Remaining amount of money for gas = $25.50
   * Summation = 32/7 miles + $25.50

To find the total time John was on the move, we need to add up the time spent in the car, on the bus, and exclude the time spent on the break.

Time spent in the car: 1/31 hour
Time spent on the bus: 30/12 hours
Time spent on the break: 17/4 hours

First, let's calculate the distance reduced after 1 hour:

1) Susan has $48 in her pocket.
2) The toy costs $18.
3) The tax on the toy is 41/14 dollars.

To calculate the total cost of the toy:
* Cost of toy: $18
* Tax: 41/14 dollars
* Total cost = $18 + (41/14) dollars

Now, to calculate how much money Susan has left after buying the toy:
* Susan had $48 to start
* Total cost of toy = $18 + (41/14) dollars
* Amount left = $48 - ($18 + (41/14) dollars)

Simplifying the tax calculation:
* 41/14 dollars = $2.93 (rounded to two decimal places)

Final calculation:
* Amount left = $48 - ($18 + $2.93)

Now, for the second part of the question:
4. The farmer sells 3/37 of the total honey harvested in a day.

            Tim has a quirky old car with a very unusual fuel consumption - it uses 41/39 liters of fuel per minute. If he drives for 47 minutes, how many litres of fuel will he have consumed?
        </p>

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tim's car uses 41/39 liters of fuel per minute
* He drives for 47 minutes

To calculate the total fuel consumed, we need to multiply the fuel consumption per minute by the total minutes driven.

Fuel consumption per minute: 41/39 liters
Total minutes driven: 47 minutes

Total fuel consumed = Fuel consumption per minute Ã— Total minutes driven
Total fuel consumed = (41/39) Ã— 47 liters
Total fuel consumed = (41 Ã— 47) / 39 liters
Total fuel consumed = 1927 / 39 liters
Total fuel consumed = &lt;&lt;1927/39=49.41&gt;&gt;49.41 liters

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The cargo ship carries 17/26 tons of cargo for every one of its 39 containers.
2) The ship already has an existing cargo load of 50/11 tons.
3) To find the total tonnage of the cargo on the ship after it loads all 39 containers, we need to:
   a) Calculate the total cargo load from the 39 containers
   b) Add that to the existing cargo load of 50/11 tons

Calculating the total cargo load from the 39 containers:
* Each container carries 17/26 tons
* There are 39 containers
* So the total cargo load from the 39 containers is: 39 * (17/26) = 663/26 tons

Adding the existing cargo load:
* Existing cargo load = 50/11 tons
* Total cargo load = 663/26 + 50/11 = 1,353/286 tons

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The car is traveling at a steady speed of 28 miles per hour
* We want to find how many miles the car will travel in 32 hours
* To calculate the distance traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:
* Speed = 28 miles per hour
* Time = 32 hours
* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 28 miles/hour x 32 hours
* Distance = 896 miles

1) The jug initially contained 33/37 gallons of milk.
2) James then added 3/25 gallons of milk to the jug.
3) To find the total amount of milk in the jug, we need to add the two amounts together.

To add fractions with different denominators, we first need to find the least common denominator (LCD). The LCD of 37 and 25 is 925.

So, 33/37 gallons = (33 * 25) / (37 * 25) = 825/925 gallons
And 3/25 gallons = (3 * 37) / (25 * 37) = 111/925 gallons

3) James has 30 similar jugs, each with the same combined volume as the first.
4) To find the total amount of milk in all 30 jugs, we multiply the amount in the first jug by 30.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Continuing from the previous journey, if a further segment of the journey was undertaken that took an additional 50 hours, what is the total time spent on all segments of the journey and the break?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's continue the problem:

1) The initial journey took 43/17 hours = 172/68 hours.
2) After the journey, a break of 31/4 hours = 527/68 hours was taken.
3) A further segment of the journey was undertaken that took an additional 50 hours.

To find the total time spent on all segments of the journey and the break, we need to add all the times together:

Total time = Initial journey time + Break time + Additional journey time
Total time = 172/68 hours + 527/68 hours + 50 hours
Total time = (172 + 527 + 3400)/68 hours
Total time = 4099/68 hours

            Continuing from the original journey, suppose the first segment of the journey only took 43/29 hours instead of the 43/17 hours initially stated. Keeping the break time the same at 31/4 hours, what would now be the total time spent on all parts of the journey and the break?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1) The first segment of the journey took 43/29 hours.
2) The break after the journey was 31/4 hours.

To find the total time, we need to convert the times to a common denominator:

43/29 hours = (43 * 4) / (29 * 4) = 172/116 hours
31/4 hours = (31 * 29) / (4 * 29) = 899/116 hours

Now we can add the two times together:
172/116 hours + 899/116 hours = 1071/116 hours

* Carrie's car consumes 41 liters of fuel to travel 1 hour
* She has driven for 49/48 hours

To find the total fuel consumed, we need to calculate the fuel consumed per hour and then multiply it by the total hours driven.

Fuel consumed per hour = 41 liters
Hours driven = 49/48 hours

Total fuel consumed = Fuel consumed per hour Ã— Hours driven
Total fuel consumed = 41 liters Ã— (49/48 hours)
Total fuel consumed = 41 Ã— (49/48) liters
Total fuel consumed = &lt;&lt;41 * (49/48) = 41.7917 liters&gt;&gt;41.7917 liters

4) To do this, we first need to calculate 13/41 of $33.
5) 13/41 of $33 = (13/41) * $33 = $26.46

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The turtle's speed is 19/6 feet per second.
2) The turtle travels for 24 seconds.
3) The turtle starts 20 feet ahead from the starting point.

To find the distance the turtle travels in 24 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:
* Speed = 19/6 feet per second
* Time = 24 seconds
* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = (19/6) x 24 = &lt;&lt;(19/6) x 24 = 76&gt;&gt; 76 feet

Now, we add the 20 feet the turtle started ahead to get the total distance traveled:
* Total Distance = 76 feet + 20 feet = &lt;&lt;76 + 20 = 96&gt;&gt; 96 feet

The turtle's speed is still 19/6 feet per second.
* Speed = 19/6 feet per second
* Time = 33 seconds
* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = (19/6) x 33 = &lt;&lt;(19/6) x 33 = 103.5&gt;&gt; 103.5 feet

Now, we add the 20 feet the turtle started ahead to get the total distance traveled:
