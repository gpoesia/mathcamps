    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to calculate the product of (29/2) and (19/28).
(29/2) * (19/28) = (29 * 19) / (2 * 28)

2) Next, we need to simplify the fraction.
(29 * 19) / (2 * 28) = 551 / 56

3) To further simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 551 and 56 is 7.
551 / 7 = 79
56 / 7 = 8

4) Therefore, the simplified fraction is 79/8.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Divide 27 by 12:
   27 / 12 = 2.25

2. Multiply 7 by the result of the division:
   7 * 2.25 = 15.75

To write the answer as a simplified fraction, we need to convert 15.75 to a fraction.

15.75 = 15 + 3/4
   = 63/4

Therefore, the final answer is 63/4.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1. Divide 26 by 12:
   26 / 12 = 2.1666... (repeating decimal)

2. Multiply 7 by the result of the division:
   7 * 2.1666... = 15.1666...

To write the answer as a simplified fraction, we need to convert 15.1666... to a fraction.

15.1666... = 15 + 1/6
   = (15*6 + 1)/6
   = 91/6

Therefore, the final answer is 91/6.

        Susan has a recipe that calls for 30 parts of flour to 27 parts of water. If she decides to use 29 parts of flour instead, and she keeps the water proportion the same, how much water will she use? Calculate this using fraction multiplication: ((30 / 30) * (29 / 27)).

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. The original recipe calls for 30 parts of flour and 27 parts of water.
2. Susan wants to use 29 parts of flour instead of 30 parts.
3. To find the amount of water she will use, we can use fraction multiplication:
   ((30 / 30) * (29 / 27))

Fraction multiplication:
(30 / 30) = 1
(29 / 27) = 1.0741...

Multiplying these fractions:
1 * 1.0741... = 1.0741...

Therefore, the amount of water Susan will use is 1.0741... * 27 = 29 parts.

2) Next, we need to calculate (24 / 17):
24 / 17 = 1.4117647058823528

3) Now, we multiply the two results together:
1.0909090909090909 * 1.4117647058823528 = 1.5384615384615385

4) To express the result as a simplified fraction, we need to find the common denominator and then convert the decimal to a fraction.

The common denominator is 22 * 17 = 374.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We first multiplied 14/10 by 30/5, which resulted in the simplified fraction 42/5.
2) Now we need to multiply 42/5 by 13/15.
3) To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together.
4) The numerator of the result will be 42 * 13 = 546.
5) The denominator of the result will be 5 * 15 = 75.
6) To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3.
7) 546 / 3 = 182
8) 75 / 3 = 25

2) The baker only has enough sugar to make a fraction of the batch, represented by 29/14 of a full batch.
3) To calculate the number of batches the baker can make, we need to divide the full batch amount by the fraction of the batch he can make.

1) ((15 / 13) * (24 / 24))
2) First, we need to simplify the fractions:
   (15 / 13) = 15/13
   (24 / 24) = 1

3) Now we can multiply the fractions:
   (15/13) * 1 = 15/13

4) Next, we need to multiply the result (15/13) by (22/7):
   (15/13) * (22/7) = (15 * 22) / (13 * 7) = 330/91

5) To simplify the fraction 330/91, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 11.
   330/91 = (330/11) / (91/11) = 30/8.27

6) The final answer as a simplified fraction is 30/8.27.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) (28 / 1) = 28
2) (30 / 27) = 30/27 = 10/9
3) To divide 28 by 10/9, we can multiply 28 by the reciprocal of 10/9, which is 9/10.
4) 28 * (9/10) = 252/10 = 25.2

Therefore, the result when (28 / 1) is divided by (30 / 27) is 25.2.

To write this as a simplified fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1.

The simplified fraction is: 25.2/1 = 25.2

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) (28 / 1) divided by (30 / 27) = 25.2 (as calculated in the previous response)
2) To multiply 25.2 by (6 / 19), we can multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators:
   25.2 * (6 / 19) = (25.2 * 6) / 19 = 151.2 / 19

To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator.

The greatest common factor of 151.2 and 19 is 19.

Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 19, we get:

151.2 / 19 = 7.95 / 1 = 7.95

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The recipe calls for 12/2 cups of sugar.
2. The recipe calls for 17/14 cups of flour.
3. Jim needs to multiply the amount of sugar and flour for a larger cake.
4. To calculate the total amount of sugar and flour needed, we multiply the amounts:
   (12/2) * (17/14)

To simplify this fraction, we can first multiply the numerators and then multiply the denominators:
Numerator: 12 * 17 = 204
Denominator: 2 * 14 = 28

So the simplified fraction is:
204/28

2) Next, we need to calculate the denominator: (27 / 23)
27 / 23 = 1.1739

3) Now, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
(1.3125) / (1.1739) = 1.1176

4) To represent the answer as a simplified fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 1.1176 and 1 is 1.1176.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to calculate the numerator: (27 / 18) * (19 / 8)
   (27 / 18) = 1.5
   (19 / 8) = 2.375
   1.5 * 2.375 = 3.5625

2) Now, we need to express the result as a simplified fraction.
   To do this, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
   The GCF of 3.5625 and 1 is 3.5625.
   Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3.5625 gives us:
   3.5625 / 3.5625 = 1

2) Next, we need to evaluate the denominator: (27 / 22)
27 / 22 = 1.2272727272727272

3) Now, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
(29 / 17) / (27 / 22) = 1.70588235294117647 / 1.2272727272727272

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We have two fractions: 27/10 and 27/3
2) To find the product, we multiply the numerators and then multiply the denominators:
(27/10) * (27/3) = (27 * 27) / (10 * 3)
3) Simplifying the numerator: 27 * 27 = 729
4) Simplifying the denominator: 10 * 3 = 30
5) The final product is: 729/30

To write this in simplest form, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.
The GCF of 729 and 30 is 3.
Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3, we get:
729/3 = 243
30/3 = 10

Therefore, the product of 27/10 and 27/3 in simplest form is:
243/10

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Evaluate the first part: (25 / 8)
   * 25 / 8 = 3.125

2) Evaluate the second part: (3 / 4)
   * 3 / 4 = 0.75

3) Multiply the two parts together: (3.125) * (0.75)
   * 3.125 * 0.75 = 2.34375

4) Simplify the result as a fraction:
   * 2.34375 = 19/8

Therefore, the final result is 19/8.

The result of this operation does signify a form of division or sharing something in portions. The first part (25/8) represents dividing 25 items into 8 portions. The second part (3/4) represents dividing 3 items into 4 portions. Multiplying these two division operations together results in the overall division or sharing of items into smaller portions.

1) We have the multiplication of two fractions: (21 / 26) * (20 / 9)

2) To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together.

Numerator: 21 * 20 = 420
Denominator: 26 * 9 = 234

3) The resulting fraction is: 420 / 234

4) To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator.

The GCF of 420 and 234 is 6.

5) Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 6, we get:

420 / 6 = 70
234 / 6 = 39

6) The final simplified fraction is: 70 / 39

1) The car consumes 16/10 gallons of petrol every mile.
2) The route is 13/17 of a mile long.
3) To find the amount of petrol consumed, we need to multiply the consumption rate (16/10 gallons per mile) by the distance (13/17 miles).

Multiplying the fractions:
(16/10) * (13/17) = (16 * 13) / (10 * 17) = 208 / 170 = 104/85

Therefore, the car will have consumed 104/85 gallons of petrol when it finishes the 13/17 mile drive.
