            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the total amount of rocket fuel, we need to add the weights of Rocket Fuel A and Rocket Fuel B.

Rocket Fuel A: 8 kg
Rocket Fuel B: 7 kg

Total rocket fuel = Rocket Fuel A + Rocket Fuel B
Total rocket fuel = 8 kg + 7 kg = 15 kg

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Initially, the total rocket fuel was 15 kg, which was the sum of 8 kg of Rocket Fuel A and 7 kg of Rocket Fuel B.

Now, Julia has added an extra 5 kg of Rocket Fuel C to the mixture.

To find the new total amount of rocket fuel, we need to add the 5 kg of Rocket Fuel C to the initial 15 kg.

Total rocket fuel = Initial rocket fuel + Additional Rocket Fuel C
Total rocket fuel = 15 kg + 5 kg = 20 kg

        <p>
            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Initial combination:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Officer Johnson has already checked on 10 locations
* Over the next hour, he is supposed to check 9 more locations
* To find the total number of locations he is supposed to check, we add the 10 locations he has already checked and the 9 locations he is supposed to check in the next hour.

So, the total number of locations Officer Johnson is supposed to check is:
10 + 9 = &lt;&lt;10 + 9 = 19&gt;&gt;19

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information:
* Initially, Officer Johnson was supposed to check a total of 19 locations
* He was then informed that there is an additional location he needs to patrol

To find the new total number of locations he needs to check, we add the additional location to the initial total:
* 19 + 1 = &lt;&lt;19 + 1 = 20&gt;&gt;20

Therefore, the total number of locations Officer Johnson checks now is 20.

The first landmark is 3 km away.
The second landmark is 17 km away from the first landmark.
To find the total distance Emily planned to cover between the two landmarks, we need to add the distances of the two landmarks.
Total distance = Distance to the first landmark + Distance to the second landmark
Total distance = 3 km + 17 km = &lt;&lt;3 km + 17 km = 20 km&gt;&gt;20 km

The park then added 7 more Pterodactyl exhibits.
To find the new total number of dinosaur exhibits, we add the 7 Pterodactyl exhibits to the initial 11 exhibits:
11 initial exhibits + 7 new Pterodactyl exhibits = &lt;&lt;11 + 7 = 18&gt;&gt;18 dinosaur exhibits in total.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's update the information:
* Originally, there were 16 dogs living in the neighborhood
* One house had 3 dogs
* So the total number of dogs in the neighborhood was 19
* On the same day, the dog shelter rescued one more dog

To find the new total number of dogs in the neighborhood, we need to add the 1 rescued dog to the original 19 dogs:

19 dogs (original total) + 1 dog (rescued) = 20 dogs

* Originally, Peter had $1
* He then found $2 on the street, so he had $1 + $2 = $3
* After that, he earned $12 from his dog-walking job
* To calculate the total amount of money Peter has now, we add the $3 he had before to the $12 he earned:
* $3 + $12 = $15

* Samantha has 5 tent poles for her own tent
* She needs an equal number of tent poles for her friend's tent as well, which is another 5 poles
* So the total number of poles for the two main tents is 5 + 5 = 10 poles
* Samantha then realizes she needs another set of 5 poles for a small storage tent
* So the total number of tent poles Samantha needs is:
  - 10 poles for the two main tents

2. He then plants 2 more apple trees.
3. He also plants the same number of trees as the first number, which is 1.

3. So the total number of trees so far is 1 + 3 = 4 apple trees.
4. Now, the same equation as before is applied, where the number of trees planted (3) is added to the initial number of trees (1), and the resulting number (4) is then added to the initial number of trees (1).

So, the total number of apple trees in the orchard now is:
4 (initial 1 tree + 3 new trees) + 1 (initial 1 tree) = 5 apple trees.

* 6 + X = 6 + 10

Therefore, Mary gave Peter 10 more candles as a gift, so the total number of candles Peter has now is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Originally, Peter had 16 candles
* His mom gave him 3 more candles

To find the total number of candles Peter has now, we can use the following equation:
* Original number of candles + Number of candles received from mom = New total number of candles
* 16 + 3 = 19

Therefore, Peter now has a total of 19 candles.

* The wizard casts a spell twice during the magic duel
* Each spell he casts summons 4 mystical eagles
* To find the total number of mystical eagles summoned, we need to multiply the number of spells cast by the number of eagles summoned per spell

First, we know the wizard cast the spell 2 times.
Next, we know each spell summons 4 mystical eagles.
So, the total number of mystical eagles summoned is:
2 spells x 4 eagles per spell = &lt;&lt;2 x 4 = 8&gt;&gt;8 mystical eagles

* So the total number of mystical eagles summoned in the first round was 2 x 4 = 8

Now, in the second round:
* The wizard cast 2 more spells
* Each spell summoned 4 mystical eagles
* So the total number of mystical eagles summoned in the second round was 2 x 4 = 8

To find the total number of mystical eagles summoned, we add the number from the first round and the second round:
* Total mystical eagles summoned = 8 + 8 = &lt;&lt;8 + 8 = 16&gt;&gt;16

* Bobby climbs 9 steps to reach the top of the jungle gym
* The slide is 6 steps longer than his initial climb

To find the length of the slide, we need to add 6 steps to the initial climb of 9 steps.

* Slide length = Initial climb + 6 steps

* The slide that Bobby took was 15 steps long
* The ladder he chooses to go back up is 2 steps longer than the slide

To find the length of the ladder, we need to add 2 steps to the length of the slide.

* Ladder length = Slide length + 2 steps

* He then bought 7 more lemons.
* So now he has 3 + 7 = 10 lemons.
* He then decides to buy the same amount, which is 10 more lemons.

* On Monday, Tom saw 1 UFO
* On Tuesday, he saw 5 more UFOs
* On Wednesday, he saw another 7 UFOs

To find the total number of UFOs Tom has seen, we need to add up the number of UFOs he saw each day:
* Monday: 1 UFO
* Tuesday: 5 UFOs 
* Wednesday: 7 UFOs

Adding these up, we get:
1 + 5 + 7 = &lt;&lt;1 + 5 + 7 = 13&gt;&gt;13 UFOs

* To find the total number of pieces of cheese Irina has collected, we add the amounts from yesterday and today:
