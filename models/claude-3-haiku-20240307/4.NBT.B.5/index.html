        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The police department issues 65 tickets each day
* They do this for 34 days

To find the total number of tickets issued, we need to multiply the number of tickets per day by the number of days:
* 65 tickets per day x 34 days = 2,210 tickets

Therefore, the total number of tickets issued by the police department is:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Your friend has been saving money for 2 years
* Every year, they manage to save $2008
* To find the total amount of money they have saved, we need to multiply the amount they save each year by the number of years they have been saving

So, the calculation is:
* Amount saved per year: $2008
* Number of years: 2
* Total amount saved = $2008 x 2 = $4016

            Considering the previous scenario, let's say the machinery was recalibrated and now each of the 84 strands of rope are now 742 meters long instead of 75 meters. How long is the total length of all strands now?

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* Originally, there were 84 strands of rope, each 75 meters long
* So the total length of all strands was 84 x 75 = 6,300 meters
* Now, the machinery has been recalibrated and each strand is 742 meters long
* To find the new total length of all strands, we multiply the number of strands (84) by the new length of each strand (742)

Total length of all strands = 84 x 742 meters
Total length of all strands = &lt;&lt;84 x 742 = 62,328&gt;&gt; 62,328 meters

18 miles x 18 miles = 324 square miles.
### Answer: 324 square miles.</pre>

The grape farm produces 60 clusters of grapes every day.
Each cluster contains 64 grapes.
To find the total number of grapes produced in a day, we need to multiply the number of clusters by the number of grapes in each cluster.
60 clusters x 64 grapes per cluster = &lt;&lt;60 x 64 = 3,840&gt;&gt;3,840 grapes produced in a day.
