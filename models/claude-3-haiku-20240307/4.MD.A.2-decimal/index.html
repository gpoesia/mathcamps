    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Maria was driving at an average speed of 11.0 miles per hour for 6.7 hours.
2) To find the distance covered in the first stretch, we multiply the speed by the time:
   11.0 miles/hour x 6.7 hours = 73.7 miles
3) After completing the first stretch, Maria continued for another 4.3 miles before stopping.
4) To find the total distance covered, we add the distance from the first stretch and the additional 4.3 miles:
   73.7 miles + 4.3 miles = 78.0 miles

        A car travels a distance of 775.644 miles on 43.6 gallons of fuel. How many miles does the car travel per gallon of fuel?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
To find the number of miles the car travels per gallon of fuel, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the total amount of fuel used.

The total distance traveled is 775.644 miles.
The total amount of fuel used is 43.6 gallons.

To calculate the miles per gallon, we divide the total distance by the total fuel used:
775.644 miles / 43.6 gallons = 17.8 miles per gallon

### Answer: 17.8 miles per gallon.</pre>

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The car's fuel efficiency standard is 27 miles per gallon.
2. In the previous problem, we calculated that the car is actually traveling 17.8 miles per gallon.
3. To find how much the car is falling short of the fuel efficiency standard, we need to subtract the actual miles per gallon from the standard miles per gallon.

27 miles per gallon (standard) - 17.8 miles per gallon (actual) = 9.2 miles per gallon

Therefore, the car is falling short of the fuel efficiency standard by 9.2 miles per gallon.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The car initially had 49 gallons of fuel.
- The car traveled a distance of 775.644 miles.

To calculate the updated miles per gallon, we divide the total distance traveled by the total amount of fuel used.

Total distance traveled: 775.644 miles
Total fuel used: 49 gallons

Miles per gallon = Total distance traveled / Total fuel used
Miles per gallon = 775.644 miles / 49 gallons

1) The original garden was 3 meters wide.
2) Eva extended the garden by 22.6 meters.
3) The total length of the garden after the extension is the original width (3 meters) times the total length after the extension.
4) To find the total length after the extension, we add the original width (3 meters) and the extension (22.6 meters): 3 + 22.6 = 25.6 meters.
5) The total area of the garden is the length times the width. The length is 25.6 meters and the width is 3 meters.

1) The original width of the garden is now 16 meters.
2) Eva extends the garden by 22.6 meters, so the total length after the extension is 16 + 22.6 = 38.6 meters.
3) The total length of the garden is the original width (16 meters) times the total length after the extension (38.6 meters).
4) So the total length of the garden is 16 * 38.6 = 617.6 meters.
5) The total area of the garden is the length (617.6 meters) times the width (16 meters).

* Jerry's distance: 43.4 miles
* Spike's distance: 43.4 + 31 = 74.4 miles

Now we can add up the total distance:

* Originally, Samuel had 176 liters of paint and distributed it evenly into 8 barrels
* This means each barrel had 22 liters of paint (as calculated in the previous problem)
* Now, Samuel wants to fill 43 barrels with the same quantity of paint as before
* To find the total amount of paint needed, we multiply the amount of paint per barrel (22 liters) by the number of barrels (43):
* 22 liters per barrel x 43 barrels = &lt;&lt;22 x 43 = 946&gt;&gt;946 liters of paint in total

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The car consumes 615 liters of gas every 41 hours
* We need to find how many liters of gas it will consume in 30 hours

To do this, we can set up a proportion:
* 41 hours : 615 liters = 30 hours : x liters

Solving for x:
* 41x = 30 * 615
* x = (30 * 615) / 41
* x = 450 liters

Therefore, the car will consume 450 liters of gas in 30 hours.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The car consumes 615 liters of gas every 41 hours
* The car has consumed gas for 30 hours
* Due to a leak, the car lost 46.33 liters of gas

First, let's calculate how much gas the car consumed in 30 hours:
* 30 hours / 41 hours = 0.7317 (rounded to 4 decimal places)
* 0.7317 * 615 liters = 450 liters

Now, we subtract the 46.33 liters lost due to the leak:
* 450 liters - 46.33 liters = 403.67 liters

Therefore, the car has 403.67 liters of gas remaining.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The car consumes 615 liters of gas every 23 hours
* We need to find how many liters of gas it will consume in 30 hours

To do this, we can set up a proportion:
* 23 hours : 615 liters = 30 hours : x liters

Solving for x:
* 23x = 30 * 615
* x = (30 * 615) / 23
* x = 800 liters

Therefore, the car will consume 800 liters of gas in 30 hours at the new rate of 615 liters every 23 hours.

1. You bought a car for $303.5756.
2. You decided to pay it off in 19.51 monthly installments.
3. To find the amount for each monthly installment, we divide the total cost of the car by the number of monthly installments:
   $303.5756 / 19.51 = $15.56 per monthly installment

4. You then add $41.35 to your monthly installments for car insurance.
5. To find the total monthly payment for your car and insurance, we add the monthly installment for the car ($15.56) and the car insurance ($41.35):

To calculate the average mileage per gallon, we divide the total distance by the total amount of gas used:
Average mileage per gallon = Total distance / Total gas used
Average mileage per gallon = 436.23179999999996 miles / 46.26 gallons

* They both worked the same shift of 14.28 hours

To calculate how much they collectively earned:

David's earnings:
* $46.37 per hour x 14.28 hours = $661.53

Robert's earnings:
* $19.96 per hour x 14.28 hours = $284.89

The car travels at a constant speed of 48 km per hour.
The distance traveled is equal to the speed multiplied by the time.
The time given is 3.6 hours.
Therefore, the distance traveled is:
Speed × Time = 48 km/h × 3.6 h = &lt;&lt;48 km/h × 3.6 h = 172.8 km&gt;&gt;172.8 km

  * Speed × Time = 48 km/h × 3.6 h = 172.8 km
* After the initial 3.6 hours, the car continued to travel for another 30.0 km
* To find the total distance traveled, we add the initial 172.8 km and the additional 30.0 km:

Total distance: 50.0 kilometers
Distance before break: 40 kilometers
Distance after break: 50.0 - 40 = 10 kilometers

* So the total number of loaves produced was 10 loaves/hour x 36 hours = 360 loaves

Now, the bakery has improved their efficiency and can make 21 loaves per hour.

To find the new total number of loaves produced in 36 hours, we need to multiply the new loaves per hour by the number of hours:

* Loaves of bread made per hour: 21

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* You have already finished a 23.0-kilometer route
* You will continue for another 17.2 kilometers

To find the total travel distance, we need to add the distance you have already traveled (23.0 km) and the distance you will continue to travel (17.2 km).

Total travel distance = 23.0 km + 17.2 km
Total travel distance = 40.2 km

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Part 1:
* You have already finished a 23.0-kilometer route
* You will continue for another 17.2 kilometers
* Total travel distance so far = 23.0 km + 17.2 km = 40.2 km

Part 2:
* You have a 48.2-kilometer course to finish
* To find how many more kilometers you need to travel, we subtract the total distance you have already traveled (40.2 km) from the total course distance (48.2 km)
* Remaining distance to travel = 48.2 km - 40.2 km = 8.0 km

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

* You have already finished a 23.0-kilometer route
* The total length of the route is 48 kilometers

To find the total travel distance, we need to add the distance you have already traveled (23.0 km) and the remaining distance of the route (48 km - 23 km).

Remaining distance of the route = 48 km - 23 km = 25 km

Total travel distance = 23.0 km + 25 km
Total travel distance = 48 km

        A car travels 46.72 miles per hour. After 11.62 hours of driving, the car's gas tank indicates that an additional 41 miles can be covered before the gas runs out. How many miles can the car still travel in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The car travels 46.72 miles per hour
* The car has been driving for 11.62 hours
* The car's gas tank indicates that an additional 41 miles can be covered before the gas runs out

First, let's calculate the distance the car has already traveled:
* Distance traveled = 46.72 miles/hour x 11.62 hours = &lt;&lt;46.72 x 11.62 = 542.7664&gt;&gt; 542.77 miles

Now, we know that the car can still travel an additional 41 miles before the gas runs out.
* Total distance the car can still travel = &lt;&lt;542.7664 + 41 = 583.7664&gt;&gt; 583.77 miles

        If the car was only traveling for 12 hours instead of 23 hours, at the same speed of 41.8 miles per hour, how many miles would the car travel?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The car is traveling at a constant speed of 41.8 miles per hour
* The car is traveling for 12 hours
* To find the total distance traveled, we multiply the speed by the time:
Speed × Time = Distance
* 41.8 miles per hour × 12 hours = &lt;&lt;41.8 × 12 = 501.6&gt;&gt;501.6 miles

        A farmer has a cow that produces 35.7 liters of milk every day. How much milk does the cow produce in 28 days?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The cow produces 35.7 liters of milk every day.
To find the total amount of milk produced in 28 days, we need to multiply the daily milk production by the number of days.
35.7 liters per day x 28 days = &lt;&lt;35.7 x 28 = 999.6&gt;&gt;999.6 liters of milk.

### Answer: 999.6 liters</pre>

        After producing milk for 28 days, the farmer sells 20 liters to a local cheese producer. How much milk does he have left?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The farmer had 999.6 liters of milk after 28 days of production.
The farmer then sold 20 liters to a local cheese producer.
To find the amount of milk the farmer has left, we need to subtract the 20 liters sold from the total 999.6 liters.
999.6 liters - 20 liters = &lt;&lt;999.6 - 20 = 979.6&gt;&gt;979.6 liters of milk left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The cow produces 19 liters of milk every day.
To find the total amount of milk produced in 28 days, we need to multiply the daily milk production by the number of days.
19 liters per day x 28 days = &lt;&lt;19 x 28 = 532&gt;&gt;532 liters of milk.
