        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The dolphin trainer has a total of 10 dolphins
* 3 of them are mature dolphins
* The rest are young dolphins

To find the number of young dolphins, we need to subtract the number of mature dolphins from the total number of dolphins.

Total number of dolphins: 10
Number of mature dolphins: 3

Number of young dolphins = Total number of dolphins - Number of mature dolphins
Number of young dolphins = 10 - 3 = 7

* There are 10 books on the shelf
* 4 of them are fantasy novels
* We need to find how many of the books are science fiction novels

Since we know that 4 of the books are fantasy novels, that means the remaining books must be either science fiction or some other genre.

We don't have any information about how many of the remaining 6 books are science fiction. So the number of science fiction novels could be anywhere from 0 to 6.

Without any additional information, we cannot determine the exact number of science fiction novels on the shelf.

Let's represent the number of letters he wrote yesterday as x.
Then, the total number of letters he wrote is x + 10.

We know that x + 10 = 17, so we can solve for x:
x + 10 = 17
x = 17 - 10
x = 7

Therefore, Sean wrote 7 letters yesterday.

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Judy initially had 10 marshmallows in her bag
* She then added some more marshmallows to the bag
* The total number of marshmallows in the bag is now 19

To find out how many marshmallows she added, we need to subtract the initial number of marshmallows (10) from the total number of marshmallows (19).

19 - 10 = 9

Therefore, Judy added 9 marshmallows to her bag.

* The jeweler initially had 10 rings on display.
* He later added h more rings to the display.
* The total number of rings then became 18.

To find the number of rings the jeweler added, we can use the following equation:
Initial number of rings + Number of rings added = Total number of rings
10 + h = 18

Solving for h:
h = 18 - 10
h = 8

Therefore, the jeweler added 8 more rings to the display.

* After buying some more, he now has 11 pillows in total on his bed
* To find how many pillows he bought, we need to subtract the original number of pillows from the new total number of pillows

So, the calculation is:
* Total pillows after buying more = 11
* Original number of pillows = 10
* Number of pillows bought = 11 - 10 = 1

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The alien originally had 10 eyes.
2 of the eyes got damaged in a battle.
To find the number of eyes the alien has left, we subtract the number of damaged eyes from the original number of eyes.
10 eyes - 2 damaged eyes = &lt;&lt;10 - 2 = 8&gt;&gt;8 eyes left.

* Henry had a certain number of erasers initially
* He then bought 10 more erasers from a store
* Now, he has 18 erasers in total

To find the number of erasers Henry had initially, we can use the following equation:
* Initial number of erasers + 10 = 18

Solving for the initial number of erasers:
* Initial number of erasers = 18 - 10 = 8

Therefore, Henry had 8 erasers initially.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* John has a total of 10 keys
* 8 of these keys are house keys
* We need to find how many of the keys are not house keys

To find the number of keys that are not house keys, we can subtract the number of house keys from the total number of keys:
* Total keys = 10
* House keys = 8
* Keys that are not house keys = 10 - 8 = 2

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* You originally had a collection of some crayons
* You found one more crayon
* Now you have a total of 10 crayons

To find how many crayons you had before finding the extra one, we can use the following equation:

Original number of crayons + 1 = 10

Solving for the original number of crayons:
Original number of crayons = 10 - 1 = 9

* Initially, there were 10 people present at the party.
* Then, some more people arrived.
* The total number of people at the party increased to 11.

To find the number of extra people that arrived, we need to subtract the initial number of people from the final number of people.

The initial number of people was 10.
The final number of people was 11.

So, the number of extra people that arrived is:
11 - 10 = 1

* Initially, the bunch of grapes has 10 fruits
* We add 'u' more grapes to the bunch
* The total number of grapes after adding 'u' is 16

We can set up an equation to solve for 'u':
* Initial grapes + Additional grapes = Total grapes
* 10 + u = 16

Solving for u:
* u = 16 - 10

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The toothpaste brand packs 10 tubes of toothpaste into each box.
* The store received 14 tubes of toothpaste.

To find how many tubes did not come from a full box, we need to determine how many full boxes were received, and then subtract that from the total number of tubes received.

First, let's find how many full boxes were received:
* 14 tubes / 10 tubes per box = 1.4 boxes
* Since we can't have a partial box, we round down to 1 full box.

Now, we can subtract the number of tubes from the full box to find how many did not come from a full box:
* 1 full box x 10 tubes per box = 10 tubes
* 14 tubes received - 10 tubes from the full box = 4 tubes that did not come from a full box.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The butterfly starts the day with 6 flowers
* She needs a total of 10 flowers for the day
* So, the number of additional flowers she needs to visit in the afternoon is:
   * Total flowers needed - Flowers she already has = 10 - 6 = 4
* Therefore, the butterfly needs to visit 4 more flowers in the afternoon.

        Eli has 10 toy cars in the sandbox. If he found a total of 11 toy cars in there, how many toy cars had been buried in the sandbox that he did not initially see?
    </p>

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Eli initially had 10 toy cars in the sandbox
* He then found a total of 11 toy cars in the sandbox
* This means that there were additional toy cars that he did not initially see

To find the number of toy cars that were buried in the sandbox that he did not initially see, we can subtract the number of cars he initially had from the total number of cars he found:
* Total cars found - Initial cars = Cars not initially seen
* 11 - 10 = 1

Therefore, Eli found 1 additional toy car that had been buried in the sandbox that he did not initially see.
