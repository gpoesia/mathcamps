To find the total number of bushels of apples used:
1. Calculate the amount of each box that is filled with apples:

2. Multiply the amount of each box filled with apples by the total number of boxes:
   * 8/11 * 11 = 8 bushels per box

2. Peter needed 14/18 cups of sugar for his pizza dough.

To find the total cups of ingredients needed, we need to multiply the amounts of flour and sugar together.

19/9 cups of flour x 14/18 cups of sugar = (19/9) x (14/18)

To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:

* There are 18 students in the group
* Each student will eat 17/20 of a pizza
* To find the total amount of pizza needed, we need to multiply the number of students by the amount each student will eat:
* 18 students x 17/20 pizza per student = 306/20 pizzas
* To find the number of whole pizzas needed, we need to round up to the nearest whole number:
* 306/20 = 15.3 pizzas
* Rounding up to the nearest whole number, the group should order 16 pizzas.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The recipe requires 10 apples.
2) You only have two-thirds of the amount needed.
3) To find how many apples you have, we multiply 10 apples by 4/6.

Explanation:
* 10 apples x 4/6 = 40/6 = 6.67 apples

Therefore, if you multiply 10 apples by 4/6, you have 6.67 apples.

* To find how many pizzas the chef can make before they sell out, we need to find how many pizzas can be made in 9/20 of an hour

First, let's find how many pizzas can be made in 1 hour:
* 16 pizzas in 1 hour
* So, in 9/20 of an hour, the chef can make:
* (9/20) * 16 = 7.2 pizzas

Since we can't have a fractional pizza, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

* Tom has 13 boxes total
* He has decided to give each of his friends 12/13 of a box
* To find the total number of boxes his friends will receive, we need to multiply the number of friends by the amount each friend will receive

First, let's find out how many friends Tom has. Since each friend will receive 12/13 of a box, and Tom has 13 boxes total, we can divide 13 by 12/13 to find the number of friends:
* 13 Ã· (12/13) = 13 * (13/12) = &lt;&lt;13 * (13/12) = 13.75&gt;&gt; 13.75 friends

Since we can't have a fractional friend, we'll round down to 13 friends.

Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes Tom's friends will receive:
* 13 friends * 12/13 boxes per friend = &lt;&lt;13 * 12/13 = 12&gt;&gt; 12 boxes

            Tom has decided to donate some of the boxes to a local school after sharing with his friends. He is now giving away 9/15 of the total boxes his friends received. How many boxes are being donated to the local school?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Tom's friends received 12 boxes total
* Tom is now giving away 9/15 of the 12 boxes his friends received

To find the number of boxes being donated to the local school, we need to calculate 9/15 of 12 boxes.

First, let's convert 9/15 to a decimal:
* 9/15 = 0.6

Now, we can multiply 0.6 by the 12 boxes his friends received:
* 0.6 * 12 = &lt;&lt;0.6 * 12 = 7.2&gt;&gt; 7.2 boxes

Since we can't have a fractional box, we'll round down to 7 boxes.

            Tom originally wanted to divide 13 boxes among his friends with each of them getting 12/13 of a box. However, he changed his mind and decided to give each friend 17/13 of a box instead. How many boxes in total will his friends receive now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

* Originally, Tom had 13 boxes
* He wanted to divide them so each friend got 12/13 of a box
* But he changed his mind and decided to give each friend 17/13 of a box instead

To find the total number of boxes his friends will receive now, we need to:
1. Calculate how many friends he has
2. Multiply the number of friends by the new amount each friend will receive (17/13 of a box)

First, let's find out how many friends he has:
* Since each friend will receive 17/13 of a box, and Tom has 13 boxes total, we can divide 13 by 17/13 to find the number of friends:
* 13 Ã· (17/13) = 13 * (13/17) = &lt;&lt;13 * (13/17) = 10&gt;&gt; 10 friends

Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes his friends will receive:
* 10 friends * 17/13 boxes per friend = &lt;&lt;10 * 17/13 = 13&gt;&gt; 13 boxes

* John has a pile of 20 assignment papers to grade
* He has only managed to grade 8/18 of the pile

To find the number of papers he has graded, we need to first find the fraction of the pile that he has graded.

We know that 8/18 of the pile has been graded. To convert this to a decimal, we divide 8 by 18:
* 8/18 = 0.444444...

Now, to find the number of papers he has graded, we multiply the total number of papers (20) by the fraction he has graded (0.444444...):
* 20 * 0.444444... = 8.888888...

Since we can't have a fraction of a paper, we round down to the nearest whole number:

            <span class="response-field">Gemma 2B:</span>
        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) The fraction twelve divided by twelve is 12/12, which simplifies to 1.
2) We are multiplying the fraction 1 by the whole number 8.
3) To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator of the fraction by the whole number, and the denominator remains the same.
4) 1 x 8 = 8
5) Therefore, the result of multiplying the fraction twelve divided by twelve with the whole number eight is 8.

1. Albert needs 8/7th of a pound of clay per model.
2. He wants to create 17/3rd models.
3. To calculate the total amount of clay needed, we need to multiply the amount of clay per model by the number of models.

Step 1: Multiply the amount of clay per model (8/7) by the number of models (17/3).
8/7 Ã— 17/3 = (8 Ã— 17) / (7 Ã— 3) = 136 / 21 = 6.4761904761904762 pounds

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate the number of scoops needed for 15 cups of flour using the 14/16 cup scoop size.

The formula is:
p = 15 * (14 / 16)

Plugging in the values:
p = 15 * (14 / 16)
p = 15 * 0.875
p = 13.125

Therefore, you need 13.125 scoops to have 15 whole cups of flour.

1. The original recipe serves 16 servings.
2. Michael wants to adjust the recipe to serve 12 servings.
3. The new grape juice is 15/6 more concentrated than the original.
4. Michael calculates the new amount of grape juice as (12/16) * (15/6).

Reasoning:
* The original recipe serves 16 servings, so the amount of grape juice in the original recipe is 1 (since it's the full recipe).
* Michael wants to adjust the recipe to serve 12 servings, so the new amount of grape juice should be (12/16) of the original.
* The new grape juice is 15/6 more concentrated than the original, so the new amount of grape juice should be (12/16) * (15/6) of the original.

* The baker uses 9 cups of flour for the cake recipe
* Each cup of flour weighs 19/19 pounds
* To find the total weight of the flour used, we need to multiply the number of cups by the weight per cup

First, let's calculate the weight per cup:

Now, the baker wants to make a smaller cake that uses 6/18 of the original amount of flour.

To calculate the amount of flour used for the smaller cake:
* 6/18 of the original 9 pounds = (6/18) * 9 = 3 pounds

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 17 classrooms in the school
* 5/14 of the total classrooms forgot to recycle their papers
* To find the fraction of the total classrooms that didn't recycle their papers, we need to divide 5/14 by the total number of classrooms (17)

First, let's convert 5/14 to a decimal:
* 5/14 = 0.357

Now, to find the fraction of the total classrooms that didn't recycle their papers, we divide 0.357 by 17:
* 0.357 / 17 = 0.021

Therefore, the fraction of the total classrooms that didn't recycle their papers is 0.021.

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) First, we need to calculate (19 / 11):
19 / 11 = 1.72727272727

2) Next, we need to calculate (13 / 17):
13 / 17 = 0.76470588235

3) Now, we multiply the two results together:
(19 / 11) * (13 / 17) = 1.72727272727 * 0.76470588235 = 1.32

4) To express the answer as a simplified fraction, we need to find the common denominator. The least common denominator of 11 and 17 is 187.

5) Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the first fraction by 17, and the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by 11, we get:
(19 * 17) / (11 * 17) * (13 * 11) / (17 * 11) = 323 / 187

1) We need to multiply the fraction 4/5 by the whole number 15.
2) To multiply a fraction by a whole number, we can multiply the numerator of the fraction by the whole number, and the denominator remains the same.
3) So, 4/5 x 15 = (4 x 15)/5 = 60/5
4) To simplify the fraction 60/5, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 5.
5) 60/5 = 12/1

1. On Monday, Emily uses 10/19th of her weekly allowance.

2. On Tuesday, she spends an equivalent amount, which is 14/7 times more compared to what she spent on Monday.

To calculate the amount she spent on Tuesday, we need to multiply the amount she spent on Monday by 14/7.

The amount she spent on Monday is 10/19 of her weekly allowance.

So, the amount she spent on Tuesday is:
(10 / 19) * (14 / 7)

Calculating this:
(10 / 19) * (14 / 7) = (10 * 14) / (19 * 7) = 140 / 133 = &lt;&lt;140/133&gt;&gt;1.0526315789473684

2. Multiply that by the number of boxes

Step 1: Calculating the number of dozens in each box
* 8/5 dozen = 1.6 dozen

Step 2: Multiplying the number of dozens per box by the number of boxes
* 1.6 dozen per box x 11 boxes = 17.6 dozen

Therefore, the total number of dozens of cookies you have is 17.6 dozen.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* In the previous problem, we found that 8 x 1/1 = 8
* Now we are multiplying that answer (8) by 3/2
* To multiply two fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together
* 8 x (3/2) = (8 x 3) / 2
* 8 x 3 = 24

* In the previous problem, we multiplied 8 by 1/1 and the result was 8.
* Now, we are asked to find the result of multiplying 20 by 1/1.
* As we determined before, 1/1 is equal to 1, since any number divided by 1 is equal to that number.
* So we are multiplying 20 by 1.

1) The length of the original sheet is 5/15 meters.
2) Jack wants to cut 9 identical pieces from the sheet.
3) To find the total length of all 9 pieces, we need to first find the length of each individual piece.
4) To find the length of each piece, we divide the original length (5/15 meters) by 9:
5/15 Ã· 9 = 5/135 meters
5) Now, to find the total length of all 9 pieces, we multiply the length of each piece (5/135 meters) by 9:
5/135 Ã— 9 = 45/135 meters
6) Simplifying the fraction, we get:
45/135 = 1/3 meters.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) We found that multiplying 13 by the ratio of 2 to 2 (which is 1) gives us 13.
2) Now we need to multiply 13 by the fraction 8/14.
3) 13 x (8/14) = (13 x 8) / 14 = 104 / 14 = 7.4285714286

            Your pet dog, Bear, can chase and bring back the ball twice every minute during your playtime. After playing for 6 minutes, how many times did Bear bring the ball back? 

This can be represented by 2*6. 

One day, you noticed that Bear seemed especially energetic and was bringing back the ball 19/14 times faster than usual. Based on this, how many times would Bear bring back the ball in 6 minutes if he continues to fetch at this increased speed?

This can be represented by (19/14) * (2*6). Calculate and write your answer as a simplified fraction.

1. In the first 6 minutes of playtime, Bear brings back the ball 2 times per minute, so in 6 minutes he brings it back 2 * 6 = 12 times.

### Answer: 12

2. You noticed that Bear was bringing back the ball 19/14 times faster than usual. 

To calculate the new rate, we take the original rate (2 times per minute) and multiply it by 19/14:
(2 * 19) / 14 = 38/14 = 19/7 times per minute

3. Now we calculate how many times Bear would bring back the ball in 6 minutes at this increased speed:
(19/7) * 6 = 114/7 times

5) (55 * 1) / (8 * 5) = 55/40
6) Simplifying the fraction, we get 11/8.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We have the multiplication of a fraction (11/8) and an integer (9).
2) To multiply a fraction and an integer, we can rewrite the integer as a fraction with a denominator of 1.
3) So (11/8) * 9 = (11/8) * (9/1)
4) To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
5) (11/8) * (9/1) = (11 * 9) / (8 * 1)
6) (11 * 9) / (8 * 1) = 99/8
