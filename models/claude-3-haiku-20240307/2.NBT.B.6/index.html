        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) At first, there were 66 teenagers and 6 adults, so the initial number of guests was 66 + 6 = 72.
2) Later, the number of guests increased by 62, so the new total was 72 + 62 = 134.
3) Near the end, an additional group of 52 people joined the party, so the final total was 134 + 52 = 186.

1) At the party, the total number of people who attended was 186 (as calculated in the previous problem).
2) At the pre-party, there were 66 teenagers and 6 adults, so the total number of people at the pre-party was 66 + 6 = 72.

2. It then takes a detour for an additional 25 squids.
3. After the detour, it travels another 33 squids.

To calculate the total distance traveled, we need to add up all the distances:

To calculate the total distance traveled, we need to add the additional 83 squids to the previous total of 101 squids:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Initially, the robot traveled 10 meters.
2) Then, it ran an updated programming command that allowed it to travel 26 meters more than the initial 10 meters.
   - So, the total distance after the first update was 10 meters + 26 meters = 36 meters.
3) After the first update, the robot was given another update that allowed it to travel an additional 89 meters.
   - So, the total distance after the second update was 36 meters + 89 meters = 125 meters.

            In a math class, students have to draw shapes based on certain numeric conditions. One student starts by rotating an angle to form 92 degrees. Then, he rotates the same angle by an additional 84 degrees. This gives him shape 't'. He modifies shape 't' by rotating another 90 degrees and labels this as shape 'l'. Finally, he rotates it by another 66 degrees to form shape 'n'. What is the total degree measure of the rotations made to get shape 'n'?

* There are 98 rings on display in the first display case.
* The number of rings in the second display case is equal to 59 plus the number of rings in the first display case.

So, we can represent this as an equation:
* Number of rings in second display case = 59 + 98
* Number of rings in second display case = 157

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

* Originally, there were 157 rings in the second display case.
* The jewelry store then received a new batch of 84 rings.
* These 84 new rings were added to the second display case.

To find the new total number of rings in the second display case, we add the original 157 rings to the 84 new rings:

* New total number of rings in second display case = 157 + 84
* New total number of rings in second display case = 241

            Let's rethink our original scenario at the jewelry store. Suppose instead that the second display contained a number of rings equal to 43 plus the number of rings in the first display case, which was 98. In that case, how many rings would the second display case have held?

* The first display case has 98 rings
* The second display case has a number of rings equal to 43 plus the number of rings in the first display case

So, we can set up the equation as:
* Number of rings in second display case = 43 + 98

Solving this equation:
* Number of rings in second display case = 43 + 98
* Number of rings in second display case = 141

            In the previous problem, we considered an increase in rainfall of 31mm from Thursday to Friday. But what if the increase was less, let's say only 19mm more than Thursday's rainfall of 69mm? Then how much total rainfall did the city experience on Friday and Saturday?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's re-work this with the new information:

* On Thursday, the city experienced 69mm of rainfall.
* On Friday, the rainfall increased by 19mm compared to the previous day.
   * So, the rainfall on Friday was 69mm + 19mm = 88mm.
* On Saturday, the city saw 82mm of rain.

Now, to find the total rainfall on Friday and Saturday, we add the amounts for those two days:
* Friday rainfall: 88mm
* Saturday rainfall: 82mm
* Total rainfall on Friday and Saturday: 88mm + 82mm = 170mm

To find the total number of eyeglasses sold, we need to add up the sales from before May, May, and June.

* In June, the shop sold 84 eyeglasses
* The total number of glasses sold before May was 44

Now, let's add up the sales from before May, May, and June:
Total eyeglasses sold = Eyeglasses sold before May + Eyeglasses sold in May + Eyeglasses sold in June
Total eyeglasses sold = 44 + 44 + 84
Total eyeglasses sold = 172

Now, let's say the shop also sold 22 eyeglasses in the first week of July.
Total eyeglasses sold = Total eyeglasses sold before + Eyeglasses sold in May + Eyeglasses sold in June + Eyeglasses sold in first week of July
Total eyeglasses sold = 44 + 44 + 84 + 22

Tank 2:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 84 oak trees in the forest
* The number of pine trees adds 75 more to the total number of trees

To find the total number of trees in the forest, we need to add the number of oak trees and the number of pine trees.

The number of pine trees is 75 more than the total number of trees. So, we can represent the total number of trees as (84 + x), where x is the number of pine trees.

The equation would be:
(84 + x) = 84 + 75
Solving for x:
x = 84 + 75 - 84
x = 75

Therefore, the total number of pine trees is 75.

Now, we can find the total number of trees in the forest by adding the oak trees and the pine trees:
Total trees = 84 oak trees + 75 pine trees
Total trees = 159

* There are 84 oak trees in the forest
* The number of pine trees adds 27 more to the total number of trees

To find the total number of trees in the forest, we need to add the number of oak trees and the number of pine trees.

The number of pine trees is 27 more than the total number of trees. So, we can represent the total number of trees as (84 + x), where x is the number of pine trees.

The equation would be:
(84 + x) = 84 + 27
Solving for x:
x = 84 + 27 - 84
x = 27

Therefore, the total number of pine trees is 27.

Now, we can find the total number of trees in the forest by adding the oak trees and the pine trees:
Total trees = 84 oak trees + 27 pine trees
Total trees = 111

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first cloud split into 8 small clouds and 13 larger ones.
* Another cloud split the same way.

To find the total number of clouds formed, we need to add up the number of small clouds and the number of larger clouds from both cloud splits.

From the first cloud split:
* 8 small clouds
* 13 larger clouds

From the second cloud split:
* Another 8 small clouds
* Another 13 larger clouds

Now we can add them all up:
* 8 + 8 = 16 small clouds
* 13 + 13 = 26 larger clouds

The total number of clouds formed is:
* 16 small clouds + 26 larger clouds = 42 total clouds

  - 13 larger clouds
* And for the second cloud:
  - 43 small clouds 
  - 13 larger clouds

Now we can add up the total number of clouds formed:

* Olivia wrote 4 words on the first day
* Olivia wrote 23 words on the second day
* So the total number of words written by Olivia is 4 + 23 = 27 words

* Isabella wrote 17 words

* To find the total number of words written by both Olivia and Isabella, we add their individual totals:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
In the morning route, the bus picked up 48 riders at the first stop and 18 riders at the next stop, for a total of 66 riders.
Since the afternoon route is exactly the same as the morning route, the bus will pick up the same number of riders in the afternoon.
To find the total number of riders for both the morning and afternoon routes, we need to double the number of riders from the morning route.
66 riders in the morning x 2 = 132 riders in total for both the morning and afternoon routes.

* Jake originally had 69 balls
* He then went to the store and bought the same amount of balls as he originally had
* So, the number of balls he bought at the store is also 69

To find the total number of balls Jake has now, we add the original 69 balls to the 69 balls he bought at the store:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's continue the problem:
* Originally, Jake had 69 balls
* He then went to the store and bought 69 more balls
* So, the total number of balls Jake had after buying the additional 69 was 69 + 69 = 138 balls
* Then, his friend gave him an additional 12 balls as a gift

To find the total number of balls Jake has now, we add the 12 balls he received as a gift to the 138 balls he had before:

1. In the first section, the zookeeper found 53 elephants.
2. In the next section, he found 71 more elephants.
3. On his way out, he realized he needed to revisit a previously counted section of 72 elephants.

To calculate the total number of elephants counted, we need to add up the elephants from each section:
* 53 elephants in the first section

2. During the night shift, the zookeeper recounted:

* Sarah baked 80 sandwiches
* Kevin made an additional quantity of sandwiches
* The total number of sandwiches made by Kevin and Sarah is 33 more than the number of sandwiches made by Sarah alone

Let's represent the number of sandwiches made by Kevin as x.

The total number of sandwiches made is 80 + x.
We know that this total is 33 more than the number of sandwiches made by Sarah alone, which is 80.

So we can write the equation:
80 + x = 80 + 33
Solving for x:
x = 33
Therefore, Kevin made 33 sandwiches.

* On the first day, the fruit vendor sold 68 bananas
* On the second day, the fruit vendor sold 49 bananas
* The small market nearby sold 35 bananas on both days
* To find the total number of bananas sold on the second day, we add the fruit vendor's sales and the small market's sales:
* Bananas sold by fruit vendor on second day: 49
* Bananas sold by small market on second day: 35
* Total bananas sold on second day = 49 + 35 = 84

* Jordy initially had 45 carrots
* Jordy gathered the same amount again, which is 45 more carrots
* So after the initial gathering, Jordy had 45 + 45 = 90 carrots
* Jordy then went to the local market and bought 4 more carrots

To find the total number of carrots Jordy has now, we add the 4 carrots she bought to the 90 carrots she had:
90 + 4 = 94

* Originally, Jordy had 14 carrots
* She then gathered the same amount again from her farm, which is another 14 carrots
* To find the total number of carrots Jordy has now, we need to add the initial 14 carrots to the additional 14 carrots she gathered

            Looking at the painting in the gallery, the artist realizes that the painting is not quite balanced. She thinks back to the painting competition, and remembers that if she had originally used 81 blue strokes instead of 53, her painting might have been more harmonious. Keeping all other elements the same, and doubling the total number of strokes for her painting just like before, she wonders how many strokes would there have been in her painting if she had made this change. How many strokes would there have been?

2. The second artist used 67 more strokes than the first artist, so the total number of strokes used by the second artist is:

3. The third artist originally doubled the total number of strokes used by the second artist, so the total number of strokes in her original painting was:

4. Now, the third artist wants to change the number of blue strokes from 53 to 81, keeping all other elements the same. The new total number of strokes used by the first artist would be:
   43 + 81 = 124 strokes

5. The second artist would then use 67 more strokes than the first artist, so the new total number of strokes used by the second artist would be:
   124 + 67 = 191 strokes

6. The third artist would then double the total number of strokes used by the second artist, so the new total number of strokes in her painting would be:

* Mike's left binocular lens can magnify objects from a distance of 30 miles away
* Mike's right binocular lens can magnify objects from a distance of 56 miles away
* Mike's telescope can magnify objects from a distance of 67 miles away

To find the total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects, we need to add the maximum distances of the binoculars and the telescope.

The maximum distance of the binoculars is the greater of the two lens distances, which is 56 miles.

So the total distance from which both his binoculars and telescope can magnify objects is:
56 miles (binoculars) + 67 miles (telescope) = 123 miles

3. To find the total Quiblets needed to cast the ancient spell, we add the Quiblets needed for the most powerful spell (80) to the additional Quiblets (130).
