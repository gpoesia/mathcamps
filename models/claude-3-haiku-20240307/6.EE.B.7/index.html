* There are a total of 355 balls in the bag
* There are already 44 green balls in the bag
* We need to find how many red balls should be added to the bag

To find the number of red balls that should be added, we need to subtract the number of green balls (44) from the total number of balls (355), and then subtract that from the total to get the number of red balls.

So, the calculation would be:
* Total balls: 355
* Green balls: 44
* Red balls needed = 355 - 44 = 311

* The drummer practices 9234 beats per day
* They play each drum solo 171 times a day
* We need to find how many beats they play during each solo

To find the number of beats played during each solo, we need to divide the total number of beats per day by the number of solos played per day.

Total beats per day: 9234
Number of solos per day: 171

Beats per solo = Total beats per day / Number of solos per day

This means that the original 373 tigers minus the 55 new tigers must have been the number of tigers in the zoo before the new ones arrived.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The star radiates a total of 401 units of energy per hour
* Out of that 401 units, 82 units are background radiation
* To find the amount of energy the star itself radiates per hour, we need to subtract the background radiation from the total radiation

Calculation:
* Total radiation per hour: 401 units
* Background radiation: 82 units
* Star's own radiation per hour = Total radiation - Background radiation
* Star's own radiation per hour = 401 - 82 = 319 units

* The juggler tossed 113 juggling balls into the air during the performance
* She started with 105 balls
* To find the number of additional balls she added to the routine, we need to subtract the starting number of balls from the total number of balls tossed

So, the calculation is:

To find the number of days the period lasted, we need to divide the total number of fireplaces produced by the number of fireplaces produced per day.

Total fireplaces produced: 1891
Fireplaces produced per day: 61

* The bubble blower machine blows 440 bubbles in one minute.
* In the first half minute, it blows 325 bubbles.
* To find the number of bubbles blown in the second half minute, we need to subtract the number of bubbles blown in the first half minute from the total number of bubbles blown in one minute.

Calculation:
* Total bubbles blown in one minute: 440
* Bubbles blown in the first half minute: 325
* Bubbles blown in the second half minute = 440 - 325 = 115

* The total amount of food eaten in four weeks is 588 pounds

To find the number of weeks accounted for, we need to determine how many weeks it would take for the lions to eat 588 pounds of food.

We can do this by dividing the total amount of food eaten (588 pounds) by the amount of food eaten per week (147 pounds):

To find the number of days the milk was collected for, we need to divide the total amount of milk produced by the average amount produced per day.

Total milk produced / Average milk produced per day = Number of days

* The wind turbine generated 361 kilowatts of electricity in a day.

To find the amount of kilowatts generated in the afternoon, we need to subtract the morning generation from the total generation for the day.

Total generation for the day: 361 kilowatts
Generation in the morning: 151 kilowatts

To do this, we can subtract the number of silver charms she gained from the total number of charms she has:

To find the original count of pieces before the last set was added, we need to find the largest multiple of 4 that is less than 276.

We can do this by dividing 276 by 4 and taking the integer part of the result:
* 276 / 4 = 69
* The largest multiple of 4 that is less than 276 is 69 * 4 = 276

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There are 326 beach balls at the seaside resort in total.
2) One part of the beach already has 246 beach balls.
3) To find the number of beach balls in the other part, we need to subtract the number of beach balls in the first part from the total number of beach balls.
4) 326 - 246 = 80
Therefore, there are 80 beach balls in the other part of the beach.

1) We know that there are 9287 passengers that took the bus this week.
2) Each bus can carry 251 passengers.
3) To find the number of buses needed, we need to divide the total number of passengers by the capacity of each bus.
4) 9287 passengers / 251 passengers per bus = &lt;&lt;9287 / 251 = 37.0&gt;&gt; 37 buses.

* The chocolate factory has a daily production of 385 chocolate bars
* 230 of those bars are dark chocolate
* To find the number of milk chocolate bars, we need to subtract the number of dark chocolate bars from the total number of bars

So, the calculation is:
* Total bars: 385
* Dark chocolate bars: 230
* Milk chocolate bars = Total bars - Dark chocolate bars

The initial altitude of the mountain was 289 meters above sea level.
After the tectonic activity, the altitude is now 357 meters above sea level.
To find the increase in altitude, we need to subtract the initial altitude from the new altitude.
357 meters - 289 meters = 68 meters

* The zoo needs 4572 pounds of food to feed all the monkeys over a month
* Each monkey eats 36 pounds of food in a month

To do this, we can divide the total amount of food needed (4572 pounds) by the amount of food each monkey eats (36 pounds):

4572 pounds / 36 pounds per monkey = 127 monkeys

To find the number of rooms in the doll house, we need to divide the total number of dolls by the number of dolls each room can hold.

Total number of dolls: 832
