* He still needs 78 kg of potatoes to fulfill the last order.
* To find how many more kilograms of potatoes the farmer needs to harvest, we subtract the initial harvest from the target:

To find the number of robots left in the store after the first day, we need to subtract the number of robots sold from the initial number of robots.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The robot factory had 84 robots in store initially
* During the first day, they sold 68 robots
* This means there were 84 - 68 = 16 robots left in the store after the first day
* The rival robot dispenser made an identical number of sales as the robot factory on the first day
* Since the robot factory sold 68 robots, the rival robot dispenser also sold 68 robots

To find the total number of robots sold by the two stores in one day, we add the number of robots sold by each store:
* Robot factory sales: 68 robots
* Rival robot dispenser sales: 68 robots
* Total robots sold = 68 + 68 = &lt;&lt;68 + 68 = 136&gt;&gt;136 robots

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Reasoning:
* Brand M originally produced 62 bags of marshmallows
* During the surprise sale, they sold 31 bags
* To find the number of bags left to sell, we need to subtract the number of bags sold from the total number of bags produced

62 bags - 31 bags sold = &lt;&lt;62 - 31 = 31&gt;&gt;31 bags left to sell

4) To find how many times less, we divide the larger number by the smaller number:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The company produced 86 helicopters this year.
They had to recall 34 of them due to a defect.
To find the number of helicopters left in their inventory, we subtract the number of recalled helicopters from the total number of helicopters produced:
86 - 34 = &lt;&lt;86 - 34 = 52&gt;&gt;52 helicopters are left in their inventory.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's rework this with the updated information.

Reasoning:
The first area had 25 starfish, not 52 as initially reported.
The second area had 42 more starfish than the first area.
So the number of starfish in the second area was 25 + 42 = 67.
The total number of starfish found is the sum of the starfish in the first area and the second area.
25 + 67 = &lt;&lt;25 + 67 = 92&gt;&gt;92 starfish were found in total during the exploration.

1. The initial temperature inside the tent was 13 degrees Celsius.
2. The first heater increased the temperature by 45 degrees Celsius.
   * So the temperature after the first heater was 13 + 45 = 58 degrees Celsius.
3. The second heating device increased the temperature by an additional 4 degrees Celsius.
   * So the final temperature after both heating devices was 58 + 4 = 62 degrees Celsius.

            In the previous scenario, Danny added a heater to his tent when the initial temperature was 13 degrees Celsius. But let's consider a different situation. Suppose the tent's initial temperature was higher and reached 81 degrees Celsius. If Danny added a heater to the tent that was already 13 degrees Celsius, what would be the final temperature inside the tent?

The paint store originally received 54 cans of red paint.
They sold 15 cans over the course of a day.
To find the number of cans of red paint left in the store, we need to subtract the number of cans sold from the total number of cans received.
54 cans - 15 cans = &lt;&lt;54 - 15 = 39&gt;&gt;39 cans of red paint are left in the store.

            Sarah has 56 bracelet beads, and she uses 37 of them to make a new bracelet. She then decides to make a second bracelet with a different design, and this one uses 36 beads.

1. Sarah has 56 bracelet beads to start with.
2. She uses 37 beads to make the first bracelet.
3. This leaves her with 56 - 37 = 19 beads remaining.
4. She then decides to make a second bracelet that requires 36 beads.
5. Since she only has 19 beads left, she needs to buy additional beads to complete the second bracelet.
6. The number of beads she needs to buy is 36 - 19 = 17 beads.

* The farmer originally had 78 apples in his orchard

            Alex has a scooter collection. In his garage, he first kept 85 scooters. He then sold 46 scooters to fellow enthusiasts. The next week, he bought another 59 from a scooter show. How many scooters does Alex have in his collection now?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Alex initially had 85 scooters in his garage.
2) He then sold 46 scooters to fellow enthusiasts.
3) To find the number of scooters Alex had after selling 46, we subtract 46 from 85:
   85 - 46 = 39 scooters
4) The next week, he bought another 59 scooters from a scooter show.
5) To find the total number of scooters Alex has now, we add the 59 scooters he bought to the 39 scooters he had after the initial sale:
   39 + 59 = 98 scooters

* Originally, Ben had 54 secret notes
* His sister took away 24 of those notes
* After retrieving some of the notes, Ben now has the same number of notes as he initially had, minus the 30 notes he had left after his sister's prank

So, we can set up an equation:
* Let x = the number of notes Ben retrieved from his sister
* Originally Ben had 54 notes
* After his sister took 24 notes, he had 54 - 24 = 30 notes left
* Now Ben has the same number of notes as he initially had, which is 54
* So the equation is: 54 = 30 + x
* Solving for x, we get: x = 54 - 30 = &lt;&lt;54 - 30 = 24&gt;&gt;24

Therefore, Ben managed to retrieve 24 notes from his sister.

            In a revision of the initial inventory, the toy store realizes there was a mistake and they originally only had 1 teddy bear in stock, not 28. But they did receive a shipment of 10 more teddy bears as mentioned before. Then, they received the shipment of 49 more teddy bears, as in the original scenario. How many teddy bears do they have in stock now after correcting the initial inventory error and receiving all the shipments?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's re-work this with the corrected initial inventory:

1. The toy store originally had 1 teddy bear in stock.
2. They then received a new shipment with 10 more teddy bears.
   * So now they have 1 + 10 = 11 teddy bears.
3. The following day, they received another shipment with 49 more teddy bears.
   * So now they have 11 + 49 = 60 teddy bears.
