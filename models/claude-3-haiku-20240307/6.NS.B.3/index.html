        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The window cleaning company charges $533.89 for cleaning the windows of a large building.
* This cost is equally shared by 20.3 tenants.
* To find how much each tenant contributes, we need to divide the total cost by the number of tenants.
* $533.89 / 20.3 = $26.31 per tenant.

            Previously, the window cleaning cost was divided among the tenants based on a total expense of $533.89. However, it turns out there was a mistake in the billing and the cleaning company only charged $21 for the job. With this adjusted cost, how much would each of the 20.3 tenants need to contribute to the window cleaning cost now?

* The window cleaning company actually charged $21 for the job, not $533.89
* This cost is still equally shared by 20.3 tenants
* To find the new contribution per tenant, we divide the total cost by the number of tenants:
* $21 / 20.3 = $1.03 per tenant

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* You bought a gold ring weighing 83.07 grams
* After polishing and curving, you lost 3.4 grams of gold from the ring
* So the weight of the ring after losing 3.4 grams is: 83.07 - 3.4 = 79.67 grams
* Afterward, you decided to add 6.8 grams of platinum to the ring

Calculation:
* Weight of the ring after losing 3.4 grams of gold: 79.67 grams
* Weight of the platinum added: 6.8 grams
* Total weight of the ring now: 79.67 + 6.8 = 86.47 grams

The initial weight of the cucumbers was 81.4 kilograms.
The final weight of the cucumbers after selling some was 66.05 kilograms.
To find the amount of cucumbers sold, we need to subtract the final weight from the initial weight.
81.4 kilograms - 66.05 kilograms = 15.35 kilograms

To find the total miles the dolphin travels each day, we need to add the two distances together.

Miles per day without current: 57.4 miles

Total miles per day = Miles per day without current + Additional miles per day due to current

* The manufacturer spent $5098.56 to produce skateboards
* The cost to produce each skateboard was $56.4

To find the number of skateboards produced, we need to divide the total cost by the cost per skateboard.

Total cost: $5098.56
Cost per skateboard: $56.4

Number of skateboards produced = Total cost / Cost per skateboard
Number of skateboards produced = $5098.56 / $56.4
Number of skateboards produced = 90.4

Since we can't have a fractional number of skateboards, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

Total budget: $5098.56
Cost per skateboard: $8

Number of skateboards that can be produced = Total budget / Cost per skateboard
Number of skateboards that can be produced = $5098.56 / $8

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The weaver used 78.81 yards of wool to weave the blanket.
After weaving the blanket, she bought an additional 89.2 yards of wool.
To calculate the total amount of wool she has now, we add the remaining wool from the initial amount (82.91 - 78.81 = 4.1 yards) and the additional 89.2 yards of wool she bought:
4.1 yards + 89.2 yards = &lt;&lt;4.1 + 89.2 = 93.3&gt;&gt;93.3 yards of wool in total.

* The car travels at a consistent speed of 2.1 miles per minute

* Speed = 2.1 miles per minute

* So the original total was:
  - 20.77 hours + 73.03 hours = 93.80 hours per week
* Now, the ballerina has decided to spend an additional 58.1 hours per week on conditioning activities.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The original amount of hot chocolate in the pot was 75.06 ounces.
The amount of hot chocolate left in the pot after serving friends is 46.86 ounces.
To find the amount of hot chocolate served to friends, we need to subtract the amount left from the original amount:
75.06 ounces - 46.86 ounces = 28.2 ounces

The amount of hot chocolate served to friends earlier was 28.2 ounces.

To calculate the new amount of hot chocolate made, we multiply the earlier amount by 74.0:

* The promotional pack weighs 84.0 grams
* The toothpaste tube inside weighs 44.52 grams
* To find the weight of the remaining components (packaging, box, etc.), we need to subtract the weight of the toothpaste tube from the total weight of the promotional pack.

Weight of remaining components = Total weight of promotional pack - Weight of toothpaste tube

            In our previous problem, the speed of the snail was 10.2 meters per day. However, what if the snail was a bit faster than we previously thought and actually crawls at a rate of 50 meters per day? In that case, how many meters would the snail have crawled in 55.57 days?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this with the new information:
* The snail can crawl 50 meters per day
* The snail is attempting to crawl a distance of 55.57 days

To find the total distance the snail will have crawled, we need to multiply the distance it can crawl in a day by the number of days it is attempting to crawl:

* 50 meters per day x 55.57 days = &lt;&lt;50 x 55.57 = 2,778.5&gt;&gt;2,778.5 meters

1) The Flash's maximum speed is 78.64 miles per hour.
2) His current speed is 48.1 miles per hour.
3) To find how much he needs to increase his speed to reach his maximum, we subtract his current speed from his maximum speed:

2) After the first planet completed half of its orbit, it was 25.9 million miles closer, so its new distance is:
   94.88 million miles - 25.9 million miles = 68.98 million miles.

3) The second planet is 98.79 million miles away from the sun.

4) To find how much farther the second planet is compared to the first planet's current position, we subtract the first planet's current distance from the second planet's distance:
   98.79 million miles - 68.98 million miles = 29.81 million miles.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The first watch model weighs 68.7 grams.
The second watch model weighs 49.3 grams.
To find the total weight of both watch models, we need to add the weights of the two models together.
Total weight = Weight of first model + Weight of second model
Total weight = 68.7 grams + 49.3 grams
Total weight = 118.0 grams

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The total weight of both watch models is 118.0 grams (from the previous question).
2) The artist wants to decorate each gram with 75.6 milligrams of gold.
3) To calculate the total amount of gold needed, we multiply the total weight (118.0 grams) by the amount of gold per gram (75.6 milligrams).
Total gold needed = 118.0 grams x 75.6 milligrams/gram
Total gold needed = 8,920.8 milligrams

To find the total amount of wood used in one day, we need to multiply the number of chairs produced by the amount of wood used per chair.

Total wood used in one day = 95.0 chairs Ã— 20.7 kilograms/chair = &lt;&lt;95.0 Ã— 20.7 = 1966.5&gt;&gt; 1966.5 kilograms

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            Following on from the previous problem, suppose the number of giraffes in the herd were halved to 19 instead of 38.9. Assuming the same total amount of leaf consumption as before (2571.29 kilograms), how many kilograms of leaves would each giraffe in this smaller herd consume daily?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work this out step-by-step:
* In the previous problem, there were 38.9 giraffes in the herd.
* The total amount of leaves consumed by the herd was 2571.29 kilograms per day.
* So each giraffe consumed 2571.29 / 38.9 = 66.11 kilograms of leaves per day.

Now, in this new scenario, the number of giraffes in the herd has been halved to 19.
* The total amount of leaves consumed by the herd is still 2571.29 kilograms per day.
* To find how much each giraffe in the smaller herd of 19 consumes, we divide the total by the new number of giraffes:
* 2571.29 kilograms / 19 giraffes = 135.33 kilograms per giraffe per day.

            <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
            A unicorn needs 217.35 units of magic energy to teleport to another location. If one rainbow provides 20.7 units of magic energy, how many rainbows will it consume for the unicorn to teleport once?

        </p>
        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The unicorn needs 217.35 units of magic energy to teleport
* One rainbow provides 20.7 units of magic energy
* We need to find how many rainbows the unicorn will consume to get 217.35 units of magic energy

To do this, we need to divide the total magic energy required (217.35) by the magic energy provided by one rainbow (20.7):

217.35 units / 20.7 units per rainbow = &lt;&lt;217.35 / 20.7 = 10.5&gt;&gt; 10.5 rainbows

Since we can't have a fractional rainbow, we need to round up to the nearest whole number:
