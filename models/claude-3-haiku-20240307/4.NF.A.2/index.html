    <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the two fractions (1/8) and (4/1), we need to determine the relationship between them.

To do this, we can convert both fractions to have the same denominator. In this case, we can convert (4/1) to (32/8) since 4 × 8 = 32.

Now, we can compare the two fractions:
(1/8) &lt; (32/8)

Therefore, the correct comparison is:
(1/8) &lt; (4/1)

Converting the fractions to have the same denominator of 70:
(3/7) = (30/70)
(9/10) = (63/70)

Comparing the two fractions with the same denominator:
(30/70) &lt; (63/70)

Therefore, the relationship between the two fractions is:
(3/7) &lt; (9/10)

The comparison is different from the previous problem, where (3/2) was greater than (9/10). 

Decreasing the numerator of the first fraction from 3 to 3/7 has made the first fraction smaller in value compared to the second fraction (9/10).

    <pre class="model-raw-response">To compare the two fractions (9/8) and (6/4), we need to find a common denominator and then compare the numerators.

The common denominator would be the least common multiple of 8 and 4, which is 8.

(9/8) = (9 × 1) / (8 × 1) = 9/8
(6/4) = (6 × 2) / (4 × 2) = 12/8

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

(9 / 9) = 1
(6 / 4) = 1.5

Now, let's compare the two fractions:

Since 1 &lt; 1.5, we can conclude that:
(9 / 9) &lt; (6 / 4)

The relational comparison changes from (9 / 8) &lt; (6 / 4) to (9 / 9) &lt; (6 / 4) when the numerator of the first fraction changes from 9 to 9 (effectively making it 1), while the second fraction remains the same.

Using the same comparison methods, compare the following fractions:

To compare the two fractions, we need to find a common denominator and then compare the numerators.

The common denominator would be 28 (the least common multiple of 7 and 4).

2/7 = 8/28
2/4 = 14/28

Now, we can compare the numerators:
8/28 &lt; 14/28

Therefore, the first fraction (2/7) is less than the second fraction (2/4).

The correct symbol to fill in the blank is:

Yes, the outcome changes when we adjust the denominator of the second fraction from 9 to 4. In the previous comparison, (2/7) was greater than (2/9), but in this case, (2/7) is less than (2/4).

Therefore, the correct symbol to fill in the blank is &gt;.

The equation becomes:
(1 / 2) &gt; (1 / 4)

In this question, the denominators of the two fractions are 9 and 3. When we converted them to a common denominator of 9, the fraction (3 / 9) is still smaller than the fraction (8 / 3).

The key difference is that in the second question, the denominator of the second fraction (8 / 3) is smaller than the denominator of the first fraction (3 / 9). This means that the second fraction has a larger value, and the comparison results in (3 / 9) &lt; (8 / 3).

Now, think about what would happen if the first fraction was changed from (5 / 2) to (3 / 2). How would this change affect the comparison? Write down a similar comparison question replacing 5 with 3.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's compare the values of the fractions (5/2) and (1/2).

To compare the values, we can use the common denominator of 2.

(5/2) = (5/2)
(1/2) = (1/2)

Comparing the numerators, we can see that 5 is greater than 1.

Therefore, the relationship between the two fractions is:
(5/2) &gt; (1/2)

Now, if we change the first fraction from (5/2) to (3/2), the comparison would change.

With (3/2) and (1/2), the relationship would be:
(3/2) &gt; (1/2)

Fill in the blank 
(1 / 5) _ (2 / 1)
with &lt;, &gt;, or = to compare the two fractions. This time, suppose you're comparing one fifth of your initially available sweets against two whole sweets someone offered you. Which is greater or are they equal?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:

The fraction (1/5) represents one-fifth of the initially available sweets.
The fraction (2/1) represents two whole sweets.

When comparing the two fractions, we need to consider their values.

One-fifth (1/5) is a smaller value than two whole sweets (2/1).

Therefore, the correct symbol to fill in the blank is &quot;&lt;&quot;.

The complete expression is:
(1 / 5) &lt; (2 / 1)

Step 1: Convert the fractions to have the same denominator.
The least common denominator (LCD) of 7 and 4 is 28.

(4/7) = (4 × 4) / (7 × 4) = 16/28
(9/4) = (9 × 7) / (4 × 7) = 63/28

Step 2: Compare the numerators of the fractions with the same denominator.

To compare these fractions, we can again convert them to have the same denominator.

The least common denominator (LCD) of 7 and 4 is 28.

(4/7) = (4 × 4) / (7 × 4) = 16/28
(2/4) = (2 × 7) / (4 × 7) = 14/28

Now, we can compare the numerators of the fractions with the same denominator.
Since 16 &gt; 14, we can conclude that (4/7) &gt; (2/4).

Therefore, the correct symbol to fill in the blank is &gt;.

Comparing this to the previous problem, where (4/7) &lt; (9/4), we can see that the comparison has changed.

The key difference is that (2/4) is a smaller fraction than (9/4), so the comparison between (4/7) and (2/4) is different than the comparison between (4/7) and (9/4).

To compare the two fractions (5/9) and (4/10), we need to find a common denominator and then compare the numerators.

Rewriting the fractions with the common denominator:
(5/9) = (50/90)
(4/10) = (36/90)

Now, we can compare the numerators:
(50/90) &gt; (36/90)

When we change the denominator of the second fraction from 7 to 10, the relationship between the two fractions changes from (5/9) &lt; (4/7) to (5/9) &gt; (4/10).

This is because the larger the denominator, the smaller the fraction. So, (4/10) is less than (4/7).

(1/5) = (1 × 2) / (5 × 2) = 2/10

Now, we can compare the numerators:
2 &gt; 1

Therefore, (1/5) &gt; (1/10).

The key here is that when the denominator increases, the fraction becomes smaller. In this case, (1/5) is greater than (1/10) because 5 is a smaller number of parts than 10, so each part of (1/5) is larger than each part of (1/10).

(10 / 10) and (4 / 9)

The denominator of the first fraction is 10, while the denominator of the second fraction is 9.
Since 10 is greater than 9, the first fraction (10 / 10) has a larger denominator than the second fraction (4 / 9).

To compare the two fractions, we need to look at the relationship between the numerators and denominators.

The numerator of the first fraction is 10, while the numerator of the second fraction is 4.
Since 10 is greater than 4, the first fraction (10 / 10) has a larger numerator than the second fraction (4 / 9).

Putting this together, we can see that (10 / 10) is greater than (4 / 9).

(9 / 6) = (9 * 7) / (6 * 7) = 63 / 42

Now, we can compare the fractions:

The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is 21.

Now, we can convert the fractions to have the same denominator of 21:

(10 / 7) = (10 * 3) / (7 * 3) = 30 / 21
(9 / 3) = (9 * 7) / (3 * 7) = 63 / 21

Now, we can compare the fractions:

(9 / 3) = 63 / 21

Since 30 / 21 &lt; 63 / 21, we can conclude that:

Comparing this new ratio to the previous one:

To compare the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator (LCD) of 7 and 3 is 21.

(9 / 7) = (9 * 3 / 7 * 3) = 27/21
(10 / 3) = (10 * 7 / 3 * 7) = 70/21

Comparing the numerators, we can see that:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's compare the two fractions (8/4) and (1/10).

To compare fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator would be 40.

(8/4) = (20/10)
(1/10)

Now we can compare the two fractions:
(20/10) _ (1/10)

To determine the relationship, we can compare the numerators:
20 &gt; 1

Therefore, (8/4) &gt; (1/10).

        Great! Now, let's consider a minor change. Compare the following two fractions and fill in the blank with one of the symbols &lt;, &gt;, or =:

How does the result change compared to the previous problem when we increase the numerator in the second fraction from 6 to 5?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's compare the new fractions:

(4 / 6) and (5 / 3)

Again, we need to find a common denominator, which is 6.

(4 / 6) = (4 * 1) / (6 * 1) = 4/6
(5 / 3) = (5 * 2) / (3 * 2) = 10/6

Now we can compare the fractions:
(4 / 6) &lt; (5 / 3)

Compared to the previous problem, the result has changed from (4 / 6) &lt; (6 / 3) to (4 / 6) &lt; (5 / 3). This is because increasing the numerator in the second fraction from 6 to 5 makes the second fraction larger, so the comparison changes from less than to still less than.
