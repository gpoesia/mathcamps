    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
* Jeff has a collection of 10 sunglasses

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Mary has a total of 10 jackets in her wardrobe
* 4 of those jackets are black
* We need to find out how many jackets are of different colors (not black)

To find the number of jackets that are of different colors, we can subtract the number of black jackets from the total number of jackets:
* Total jackets = 10
* Black jackets = 4
* Jackets of different colors = 10 - 4 = 6

* So, the total number of craters on the moon after the new craters were discovered is 10 + 3 = 13 craters.
* The question is asking how many craters were there before the new craters were discovered.
* Since the total number of craters after the discovery is 13, and 3 new craters were discovered, the number of craters before the discovery must have been 13 - 3 = 10 craters.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The number 10 results from the sum of number 8 and another number.
* We can represent this as an equation: 8 + x = 10
* To find the other number, we need to solve for x.
* Subtracting 8 from both sides: 8 + x - 8 = 10 - 8
* Simplifying: x = 2

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Maria prepared a total of 10 pizzas
* Out of these, 6 were pepperoni pizzas
* We need to find out how many were mushroom pizzas

To find the number of mushroom pizzas, we can subtract the number of pepperoni pizzas from the total number of pizzas:
* Total pizzas = 10
* Pepperoni pizzas = 6
* Mushroom pizzas = Total pizzas - Pepperoni pizzas
* Mushroom pizzas = 10 - 6 = 4

* After buying a new shirt, he found he only had 1 shirt before the purchase
* This means he must have had 1 shirt after the purchase
* So, the number of shirts he bought is the difference between the number of shirts he had after the purchase (1) and the number of shirts he had before the purchase (10)
* 1 - 10 = -9
* Therefore, Peter bought 9 new shirts.

* Total episodes watched = 10
* Episodes watched in the morning = 4
* Episodes watched in the evening = Total episodes - Episodes watched in the morning

* There are 10 trees in total in the small forest
* 5 of those trees are pine trees
* To find the number of trees that are not pine trees, we need to subtract the number of pine trees from the total number of trees

So, the calculation is:
* Total trees - Pine trees = Non-pine trees
* 10 - 5 = 5

John started with 10 ounces of toothpaste.
He has squeezed out 7 ounces.
To find the amount of toothpaste he has left, we subtract the amount he has squeezed out from the initial amount:

* Crystals = 5
* Rainbow dusts = Total magical items - Crystals
* Rainbow dusts = 10 - 5 = 5

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The dolphin can jump a total of 10 feet in one leap
* 9 feet of this distance is due to its tail thrust
* We need to find the height the dolphin covers with its body strength alone

To find the height the dolphin covers with its body strength, we need to subtract the distance covered by the tail thrust from the total distance jumped.

The total distance jumped is 10 feet.
The distance covered by the tail thrust is 9 feet.

Therefore, the height the dolphin covers with its body strength alone is:
10 feet - 9 feet = 1 foot

* John has a piece of rope that is 10 feet long

* So the length of the rope that he can cut is the total length minus the 1 foot that he has to keep uncut

Calculation:
* Total length of the rope = 10 feet
* Length that must remain uncut = 1 foot

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are a total of 10 cloud types
* You have already learned about 2 of them
* To find how many more cloud types you still need to learn about, we need to subtract the number of cloud types you have already learned from the total number of cloud types.

So, the calculation would be:
* Total cloud types: 10
* Cloud types already learned: 2
* Cloud types still to learn: 10 - 2 = 8

        A SpaceX rocket is made up of different parts. If the propellant tank and the engines make up 3 parts and in total there are 10 parts, how many additional parts are there in the rocket?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The propellant tank and the engines make up 3 parts of the rocket
* In total, there are 10 parts in the rocket

To find the number of additional parts, we need to subtract the 3 parts for the propellant tank and engines from the total of 10 parts.

Additional parts = Total parts - Parts for propellant tank and engines
Additional parts = 10 - 3 = 7

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The song has 10 chords altogether, and Jessica has already learned 4 chords.
To find the number of chords she still needs to learn, we subtract the number of chords she has already learned from the total number of chords in the song.
10 chords - 4 chords learned = &lt;&lt;10 - 4 = 6&gt;&gt;6 chords left to learn.

To find the number of cannons on the other side, we can subtract the number of cannons on one side from the total number of cannons:

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* There are 10 pixies in the fairy kingdom
* 3 of them have blue wings
* We need to find how many have green wings

Since we know that 3 pixies have blue wings, that means the remaining pixies must have either green or some other color wings.

To find the number of pixies with green wings, we can subtract the number of blue-winged pixies from the total number of pixies:
* Total pixies: 10
* Blue-winged pixies: 3
* Pixies with wings other than blue: 10 - 3 = 7

Therefore, the number of pixies with green wings is 7.
