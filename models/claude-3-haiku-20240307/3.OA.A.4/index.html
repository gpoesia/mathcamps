* Each castle requires 5 builders
* There are 15 builders in total
* We need to find out how many castles are being built

To do this, we can divide the total number of builders (15) by the number of builders required per castle (5):
* 15 builders / 5 builders per castle = 3 castles

Therefore, the number of castles being built is 3.

* Each usage consumes 11 grams of toothpaste.
* To find the number of usages, we need to divide the total amount of toothpaste by the amount used per usage.

* The watch manufacturer can produce 8 watches every hour
* They have manufactured a total of 48 watches

To find the number of hours they worked, we need to divide the total number of watches produced by the number of watches produced per hour.

Total watches produced: 48
Watches produced per hour: 8

Number of hours worked = Total watches produced / Watches produced per hour
Number of hours worked = 48 / 8
Number of hours worked = 6 hours

* The tiger caught 12 fishes during the day
* The tiger eats 2 fishes per hour
* We need to find how many hours it will take for the tiger to finish all the fishes

To do this, we need to find out how many hours it will take the tiger to eat all 12 fishes.

We know the tiger eats 2 fishes per hour, so we can divide the total number of fishes (12) by the number of fishes eaten per hour (2) to get the number of hours:

12 fishes / 2 fishes per hour = 6 hours

Therefore, it will take the tiger 6 hours to finish all 12 fishes.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The customer was charged $5 per hour for renting the roller skates
* The total charge was $15

To find the number of hours the customer rented the roller skates, we need to divide the total charge by the charge per hour:

* Total charge / Charge per hour = Number of hours
* $15 / $5 per hour = 3 hours

Therefore, the customer rented the roller skates for 3 hours.

* Each child gets to throw a beach ball 7 times in a row
* There have been 21 beach ball throws in total

To find the number of children, we need to figure out how many sets of 7 throws there are in the total of 21 throws.

We can do this by dividing the total number of throws (21) by the number of throws per child (7):
* 21 throws / 7 throws per child = 3 sets of 7 throws

Since each set of 7 throws represents one child, we can conclude that there are 3 children in the group.

To find the number of guests that attended the party, we need to divide the total amount of juice (4 liters) by the amount of juice each guest received (1 liter).

Number of guests = 4 liters / 1 liter per guest

Let's say Linda currently has x dolls of the specific model.
If she doubles the quantity, she would have 2x dolls of that model.
The question states that if she doubles the quantity, she would have 2 dolls of that model.
So, we can set up the equation:
2x = 2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 1
Therefore, Linda currently has 1 doll of that specific model.

To find the quantity in liters of each serving, we need to divide the total amount of juice (45 liters) by the number of servings (5).

Quantity of each serving = Total amount of juice / Number of servings

* There are 10 bracelets made by one craftsman
* Each craftsman made exactly the same amount of bracelets
* There is 1 bracelet per craftsman displayed in the showroom

To find the number of craftsmen's work displayed in the showroom, we need to determine how many craftsmen there are in total.

Since each craftsman made the same amount of bracelets, and there are 10 bracelets total, we can divide 10 by the number of bracelets per craftsman to get the total number of craftsmen.

Since there is 1 bracelet per craftsman displayed in the showroom, the number of craftsmen's work displayed is the same as the total number of craftsmen.

Therefore, the number of craftsmen's work displayed in the showroom is:
10 bracelets / 1 bracelet per craftsman = 10 craftsmen

To find the number of play sections, we need to divide the total number of monkeys by the number of monkeys per play section.

Total number of monkeys / Number of monkeys per play section = Number of play sections

To calculate the hours watched per day, we need to divide the total hours of the series by the number of days it takes to watch it.

Total hours of the series: 56 hours
Number of days: 7 days

Hours watched per day = Total hours / Number of days
Hours watched per day = 56 hours / 7 days

* There are 9 clouds in the sky
* Each cloud has the exact same weight (w)
* The total weight of all 9 clouds is 9

Since each cloud has the same weight (w), we can represent the total weight as:
* Total weight = 9 * w

We know the total weight is 9, so we can set up the equation:
* 9 * w = 9

Solving for w:
* w = 9 / 9
* w = 1

Therefore, the weight of one cloud is 1.

* The total weight of all the doubloons is 90 grams

To find the number of doubloons, we need to divide the total weight by the weight of each doubloon:
* Total weight / Weight per doubloon = Number of doubloons
* 90 grams / 9 grams per doubloon = &lt;&lt;90/9=10&gt;&gt;10 doubloons

* Mountain Peak produces a new model of bicycles every year
* Currently, they have 63 bicycles ready for sale
* Each gear of the new model can sell exactly 7 bicycles

To find the number of gears in the new model, we need to determine how many bicycles can be sold with the 63 bicycles they have.

Since each gear can sell 7 bicycles, we can divide the total number of bicycles (63) by 7 to find the number of gears:

63 bicycles / 7 bicycles per gear = 9 gears

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The helicopter company has a policy of 10 hours of maintenance for every time the helicopter is used.
* The particular helicopter has had 70 hours of maintenance.

To find how many times the helicopter has been used, we need to divide the total maintenance hours by the maintenance hours per use.

Total maintenance hours: 70 hours
Maintenance hours per use: 10 hours

Number of times used = Total maintenance hours / Maintenance hours per use
Number of times used = 70 hours / 10 hours per use
Number of times used = 7 times

* The dolphin can jump 5 times in a single minute
* The dolphin jumps continuously for 'p' minutes
* During this time, the dolphin can jump 60 times

To find the number of minutes 'p' that the dolphin jumped for, we can set up an equation:

* After the investigation, it was found that there were 48 parts in total
* Each plane section accounts for 8 parts

To find the number of sections the plane originally had before the crash, we need to divide the total number of parts (48) by the number of parts per section (8).

48 parts / 8 parts per section = 6 sections

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The farmer collected 40 strawberries
* He divided them equally among his friends
* Each friend received 4 strawberries

To find the number of friends, we need to determine how many groups of 4 strawberries can be made from the 40 strawberries.

We can do this by dividing the total number of strawberries (40) by the number of strawberries each friend received (4):
* 40 strawberries / 4 strawberries per friend = 10 friends

* The hot chocolate booth sells their beverage for $10 per cup
* They earned a total of $70 in one day
* To find the number of cups sold, we need to divide the total earnings by the price per cup

Calculation:
* Total earnings = $70
* Price per cup = $10
* Number of cups sold = Total earnings / Price per cup
* Number of cups sold = $70 / $10
* Number of cups sold = 7

* The original price of the jacket was &quot;d&quot; dollars
* After the discount, the jacket costs $6
* The discounted price is 1/5th of the original price

We can set up an equation to solve for the original price &quot;d&quot;:
* Discounted price = 1/5 * Original price
* $6 = 1/5 * d
* Solving for d, we get:
* d = $6 * 5
* d = $30

* There are 30 starfish in total
* The starfish decided to divide themselves equally to live in different zones of the pool
* Each zone contains 6 starfish

To find the total number of zones, we need to divide the total number of starfish by the number of starfish in each zone.

Total number of starfish: 30
Number of starfish in each zone: 6

Number of zones = Total number of starfish / Number of starfish in each zone
Number of zones = 30 / 6
Number of zones = 5

* To find the number of hours of oxygen provided each day, we need to divide the total hours of oxygen by the number of days.
