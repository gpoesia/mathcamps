        A sock company packages their socks in sets of 40. They have 2840 socks to package, and they currently have 93 packs already made. How many packs of socks will they have in total once all the socks have been packaged? Afterward, they received an another shipment of 70 packs of socks, but had to return 8 due to quality issues. How many packs of socks does the company have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The sock company has 2840 socks to package, and they package them in sets of 40.
   * To calculate the number of packs they can make from 2840 socks, we divide 2840 by 40:
   * 2840 / 40 = 71 packs

2. They currently have 93 packs already made.
   * So the total number of packs they will have once all the socks have been packaged is:
   * 71 packs + 93 packs = 164 packs

3. They then received an additional shipment of 70 packs of socks.
   * But they had to return 8 packs due to quality issues.
   * So the final number of packs the company has now is:
   * 164 packs + 70 packs - 8 packs = 226 packs

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The gardener planted 80 rose bushes
2) Each bush produced 30 roses
3) So the total number of roses produced is 80 * 30 = 2,400 roses
4) However, a storm blew away 43 roses
5) So the number of roses remaining is 2,400 - 43 = 2,357 roses

        The gardener realizes afterwards that he initially miscounted the rose bushes in the field.

How many roses does he actually have remaining in the field after the correction?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1) The gardener initially thought there were 80 rose bushes, but it turns out there were actually 84 rose bushes.
2) Each bush produces 30 roses, so with 84 bushes, the total number of roses produced is 84 * 30 = 2,520 roses.
3) However, a storm blew away 43 roses.
4) So the number of roses remaining is 2,520 - 43 = 2,477 roses.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The dolphin can leap (3 + 59) = 62 feet high.
2) The dolphin completes 89 jumps in a day.
3) To find the total distance jumped in a day, we multiply the height of each jump (62 feet) by the number of jumps (89).
4) 62 feet x 89 jumps = 5,518 feet.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's rework this with the new information:

1) The dolphin can leap (41 + 59) = 100 feet high.
2) The dolphin completes 89 jumps in a day.
3) To find the total distance jumped in a day, we multiply the height of each jump (100 feet) by the number of jumps (89).
4) 100 feet x 89 jumps = 8,900 feet.

* Today, the region received an additional 90 cm of snow (instead of 29 cm)
* 20 cm of snow has melted

To calculate the total amount of snow left, we need to add the snowfall from yesterday and today, and then subtract the amount that has melted.

Total snow from yesterday and today:
* 93 cm + 90 cm = 183 cm

Amount of snow that has melted:
* 20 cm

Therefore, the amount of snow left is:
* 183 cm - 20 cm = 163 cm

        A farmer has 3069 grapes. If he decides to put 33 grapes in each bag, he will have a certain number of bags. However, the farmer eats 13 bags of grapes and also gives away 50 bags of grapes. How many bags of grapes does the farmer have left?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The farmer has 3069 grapes.
2) He decides to put 33 grapes in each bag.
3) To find the total number of bags, we divide the total number of grapes (3069) by the number of grapes per bag (33):
   3069 / 33 = 93 bags
4) The farmer then eats 13 bags of grapes.
   This means he has 93 - 13 = 80 bags left.
5) The farmer also gives away 50 bags of grapes.
   This means he has 80 - 50 = 30 bags left.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:
1) The farmer has 3069 grapes.
2) He decides to put 25 grapes in each bag.
3) To find the total number of bags, we divide the total number of grapes (3069) by the number of grapes per bag (25):
   3069 / 25 = 122.76 bags
   Since we can't have a fractional number of bags, we round down to 122 bags.
4) The farmer then eats 13 bags of grapes.
   This means he has 122 - 13 = 109 bags left.
5) The farmer also gives away 50 bags of grapes.
   This means he has 109 - 50 = 59 bags left.

8. The enhanced code is now 78 + 48 = 126.
9. This enhanced code must then be multiplied by 29, not 24 as originally stated.
10. The final value to unlock the magical lock should be 126 * 29 = 3,654.

Therefore, the correct initial value to unlock the magical lock should be 126.

To find the number of leaps the frog takes to reach the end of its journey, we need to divide the total distance by the average distance per leap:

Total distance = 192 inches

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The toy car battery lasts 16 hours without the lights on.
2. If the lights are used, the battery life decreases by the equivalent of 36 divided by 9 hours.
   * 36 divided by 9 is 4 hours.
   * So the battery life decreases by 4 hours when the lights are used.
3. The toy car is run with the lights on for 12 full weeks.
   * Each week is considered to be 60 hours.
   * So the total time the toy car is run with the lights on is 12 * 60 = 720 hours.
4. The battery life decreases by 4 hours for every hour the lights are on.
   * So the total decrease in battery life is 720 * 4 = 2,880 hours.

1. Calculate the total number of carrots collected from both patches per day
2. Multiply the total carrots per day by the number of days (77)

Step 1: Total carrots per day
* Patch 1: 26 carrots
* Patch 2: 16 carrots
* Total carrots per day: 26 + 16 = 42 carrots

Step 2: Total carrots collected over 77 days
* Total carrots per day: 42 carrots
* Number of days: 77
* Total carrots collected: 42 carrots x 77 days = 3,234 carrots

        A train travels at a speed of 68 mph but due to certain restrictions, it had to slow down to 28 mph. Considering the travel time of 21 hours, calculate the impact on the total distance traveled by the train.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The train initially travels at a speed of 68 mph
* The train then slows down to a speed of 28 mph
* The total travel time is 21 hours

To calculate the impact on the total distance traveled, we need to find the distance traveled at each speed and then add them together.

Distance traveled at 68 mph:
* Time spent traveling at 68 mph = x hours
* Distance = 68 mph * x hours

Distance traveled at 28 mph:
* Time spent traveling at 28 mph = 21 hours - x hours
* Distance = 28 mph * (21 hours - x hours)

Total distance traveled:
* Total distance = (68 mph * x hours) + (28 mph * (21 hours - x hours))

To find the value of x, we can set up an equation:
* 68x + 28(21 - x) = 68 * 21
* 68x + 588 - 28x = 1428
* 40x = 840
* x = 21 hours

Therefore, the total distance traveled by the train is:
* (68 mph * 21 hours) + (28 mph * 0 hours) = 1428 miles

1. The café sells hot chocolate for $42 per cup.
2. They sold 78 cups of hot chocolate.
3. They made an extra $58 from selling marshmallows.

To calculate the total revenue from selling hot chocolate, we multiply the price per cup ($42) by the number of cups sold (78):
* Hot chocolate revenue = $42 x 78 = $3,276

To calculate the total revenue, we add the hot chocolate revenue and the extra revenue from selling marshmallows:
* Total revenue = Hot chocolate revenue + Marshmallow revenue
* Total revenue = $3,276 + $58 = $3,334

2. The second branch also made the same amount of revenue, which is $3,334.

To calculate the total revenue from both branches, we simply add the revenue from the two branches:

* Total revenue from both branches = Revenue from first branch + Revenue from second branch

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The little mouse had stored 91 pieces of cheese for winter.
2. A thief mouse stole 77 pieces.
3. So the little mouse had 91 - 77 = 14 pieces left.
4. The little mouse then found 22 more pieces.
5. So now the little mouse has 14 + 22 = 36 pieces.
6. A kind mouse then gave the little mouse 12 more pieces.
7. So the final number of pieces the little mouse has now is 36 + 12 = 48.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The construction company can build 1425 square feet of a house in 19 days on average.
* We want to know how many square feet they would have built in 14 days.

To find this, we can set up a proportion:
* 19 days : 1425 square feet = 14 days : x square feet

Cross-multiplying, we get:
* 19x = 1425 * 14
* x = (1425 * 14) / 19
* x = 1050 square feet

Therefore, the construction company would have built 1050 square feet in 14 days.

        After reviewing the plane's logbook, the crew realizes there was a mistake in their calculations. Instead of covering 360,000 miles to travel around the world, it actually only took them 81,000 miles. Given this, how many days would it have taken them to travel around the world at a rate of 72,000 miles per day?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
* The plane actually traveled 81,000 miles around the world, not 360,000 miles.
* The plane still covers 72,000 miles per day.
* To find the number of days it would take to travel 81,000 miles at 72,000 miles per day, we need to divide the total distance by the distance covered per day.

Calculation:
* Total distance: 81,000 miles
* Distance covered per day: 72,000 miles
* Number of days = Total distance / Distance covered per day
* Number of days = 81,000 miles / 72,000 miles per day
* Number of days = 1.125 days

Since we can't have a fractional number of days, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The fairy initially sprinkles magical dust at a rate of 4332 milligrams every 76 minutes.
2) She then reduces her sprinkling rate by 44 milligrams.
   - The new sprinkling rate is 4332 - 44 = 4288 milligrams every 76 minutes.
3) She continues at this reduced rate for 52 minutes.
   - In 76 minutes, she sprinkles 4288 milligrams.
   - In 52 minutes, she will sprinkle (4288/76) * 52 = 2944 milligrams.

        After figuring out the total number of windows the maintenance team cleaned in a day, let's consider a different scenario. What if the building had originally been built with 704 windows spread over 71 floors instead of 8? How many windows would there be on each floor then?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work this out step-by-step:
* The building has 704 windows in total
* The building is 71 floors high
* Each floor has the same number of windows

To find the number of windows on each floor, we need to divide the total number of windows by the number of floors.

704 windows / 71 floors = 9.92 windows per floor

Since we can't have a fractional number of windows, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

9.92 windows per floor rounds down to 9 windows per floor.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The pet store originally had:
- 35 white mice
- 86 brown mice 
- 39 black mice

2. The store decides to double the quantity of each species of mouse.

To double the quantity, we multiply each number by 2:
- 35 white mice x 2 = 70 white mice
- 86 brown mice x 2 = 172 brown mice 
- 39 black mice x 2 = 78 black mice

3. To find the total number of mice after doubling, we add up the new quantities:
70 + 172 + 78 = &lt;&lt;70 + 172 + 78 = 320&gt;&gt;320

To find this, we need to calculate the number of bubbles per ounce of fluid.

We can do this by dividing the total number of bubbles (3654) by the total ounces of fluid (87):
* 3654 bubbles / 87 ounces = 42 bubbles per ounce

Now, to find how many bubbles it can make with 1 ounce of fluid, we simply take the bubbles per ounce (42) and multiply it by 1:

We can do this by dividing the total number of bubbles (3654) by the total ounces of fluid (47):
* 3654 bubbles / 47 ounces = 77.74 bubbles per ounce

Since we can't have a fractional number of bubbles, we'll round this down to the nearest whole number:

Now, the new scenario:
* Instead of using 13 apples, they started using 55 apples per day for the fruit salads

To find the total apples used for the fruit salads, we need to multiply the number of apples per day (55) by the number of days (30):

        In the original shipment to the library, suppose there were 95 science fiction novels instead of 67. With the 55 romance novels and 43 mystery novels remaining the same, how many new books did the library receive now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The updated shipment to the library includes:
- 55 romance novels
- 43 mystery novels
- 95 science fiction novels

To find the total number of new books the library received, we add up the number of books in each category:
55 + 43 + 95 = 193

        On a particular beach, there is a tendency for 74 seashells to appear every day. After 42 days of collection, a beachcomber also discovered an additional 56 seashells that had been hidden in the sand. How many seashells did the beachcomber have in total after 42 days?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) There is a tendency for 74 seashells to appear every day on the beach.
2) The beachcomber collected for 42 days.
3) So the number of seashells that appeared over the 42 days is:
   74 seashells per day x 42 days = 3,108 seashells
4) In addition, the beachcomber also discovered an additional 56 seashells that had been hidden in the sand.
5) Therefore, the total number of seashells the beachcomber had after 42 days is:
   3,108 seashells + 56 hidden seashells = 3,164 seashells

        Building on our beachcomber's tale, after counting his 42-day collection of seashells, he accidentally loses one seashell down a seaside crevice. Disappointed but not defeated, he decides to collect 32 more seashells the next day. How many seashells does he have in total after adding the new batch and accounting for the lost seashell?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The beachcomber originally had 3,164 seashells after 42 days of collecting.
2) He then lost 1 seashell down a seaside crevice.
3) So the new total after the lost seashell is:
   3,164 seashells - 1 lost seashell = 3,163 seashells
4) The next day, he collected 32 more seashells.
5) So the final total is:
   3,163 seashells + 32 new seashells = 3,195 seashells

        Let's revisit our beachcomber. After reconsidering his collection habit, he realizes he has been actually collecting an average of 89 seashells per day instead of 74, over the same 42 day period. He still found that additional 56 seashells hidden in the sand. Now, how many seashells does he have in total after 42 days?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1) The beachcomber was collecting an average of 89 seashells per day over the 42 day period.
2) So the number of seashells collected over the 42 days is:
   89 seashells per day x 42 days = 3,738 seashells
3) In addition, the beachcomber also discovered an additional 56 seashells that had been hidden in the sand.
4) Therefore, the total number of seashells the beachcomber had after 42 days is:
   3,738 seashells + 56 hidden seashells = 3,794 seashells
