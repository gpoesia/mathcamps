    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Mrs. Johnson needs 81 inches of fabric to complete the quilt.
She already has 50 inches of fabric.
To find the remaining amount of fabric needed, we subtract the amount she already has from the total amount required:

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Mrs. Johnson initially needed 81 inches of fabric for the quilt.
2) She already had 50 inches of fabric, so she needed 81 - 50 = 31 more inches to complete the quilt.
3) Now she wants to add a decorative border that requires an additional 55 inches of fabric.
4) To find the total amount of fabric needed, we add the 31 inches for the quilt and the 55 inches for the border:
31 inches + 55 inches = &lt;&lt;31 + 55 = 86&gt;&gt;86 inches.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
Mrs. Johnson originally planned to use 81 inches of fabric.
After redesigning the pattern, she now only needs 73 inches of fabric.
To find the difference in the amount of fabric needed, we subtract the new amount from the original amount:
81 inches - 73 inches = &lt;&lt;81 - 73 = 8&gt;&gt;8 inches.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The wall needs to be 95 meters long.
The builder has already constructed 39 meters of the wall.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The first wall was 95 meters long
* The builder had already constructed 39 meters of the first wall
* So the remaining distance he needed to construct for the first wall was 95 - 39 = 56 meters
* Now he has a new task to construct a 72-meter wall
* Since he has leftover material from the first wall, we need to find out how much more material he needs for the new 72-meter wall
* The amount of leftover material from the first wall is 95 - 56 = 39 meters
* So the additional material he needs for the new 72-meter wall is 72 - 39 = &lt;&lt;72 - 39 = 33&gt;&gt;33 meters

To find the total length of the initially uncut timber piece, we need to add the length of the two pieces together.

The first piece was 66 feet.
The second piece was 19 feet.

So the total length of the initially uncut timber piece is:
66 feet + 19 feet = 85 feet

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* The contractor initially cut the timber into two pieces
* The first piece measured 66 feet
* The remaining piece was accidentally severed into an additional 19 feet piece
* The contractor then noticed he cut 3 feet too much from the initial length of timber

To find the correct length of the initially uncut timber, we need to add the 3 feet that was cut too much back to the total length.

The total length we calculated previously was 66 feet + 19 feet = 85 feet.
Since the contractor cut 3 feet too much, we need to add that 3 feet back.

So the correct length of the initially uncut timber is:
85 feet + 3 feet = 88 feet

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate this with the new information:
* On the first day, the construction company laid 2 Km of new road.
* On the second day, they laid another 62 Km of new road.
* To find the total kilometers of road laid, we add the two amounts together:
* 2 Km + 62 Km = &lt;&lt;2 + 62 = 64&gt;&gt;64 Km

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The bookshelf is 7 feet tall (from the previous problem)
* The ceiling is 32 feet high
* We need to find the height of the remaining ladder that needs to be installed on top of the bookshelf

To calculate the height of the remaining ladder, we need to subtract the height of the bookshelf from the height of the ceiling:
* Ceiling height - Bookshelf height = Remaining ladder height
* 32 feet - 7 feet = &lt;&lt;32 - 7 = 25&gt;&gt; 25 feet

Therefore, the rest of the ladder that needs to be installed on top of the bookshelf must be 25 feet tall.

        In light of the architect's new plans, imagine instead the initial length of the trail was 70 meters before adding the extra portion. In that case, what would the total length of the trail be if an additional 21 meters were added to this 70-meter section?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The initial length of the trail was 70 meters
* An additional 21 meters were added to this 70-meter section

To find the total length of the trail, we need to add the initial 70 meters and the additional 21 meters:
* Total length = 70 meters + 21 meters
* Total length = 91 meters

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
* Mr. Johnson originally had rows of carrots that measured 55 meters in total length.
* He then added a new section for potatoes that measures 20 meters.
* To find the total length of the garden after adding the new section, we need to add the length of the carrot rows and the length of the potato section.

Total length of the garden = Length of carrot rows + Length of potato section
Total length of the garden = 55 meters + 20 meters
Total length of the garden = &lt;&lt;55 meters + 20 meters = 75 meters&gt;&gt;75 meters

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Originally, Mr. Johnson had rows of carrots that measured 55 meters in total length.
* He then added a 20 meter section for potatoes, so the total length was 55 meters + 20 meters = 75 meters.
* Now, he wants to add another 16 meter section for tomatoes.

To find the new total length of the garden, we need to add the length of the tomato section to the previous total length:

New total length = Total length before + Length of tomato section
New total length = 75 meters + 16 meters
New total length = &lt;&lt;75 meters + 16 meters = 91 meters&gt;&gt;

To find the new total length of the garden, we need to add the length of the carrot rows and the length of the potato section:

Total length of the garden = Length of carrot rows + Length of potato section
Total length of the garden = 22 meters + 20 meters
Total length of the garden = &lt;&lt;22 meters + 20 meters = 42 meters&gt;&gt;42 meters

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: The marathon course is 64 kilometers long. The runner collapsed 5 kilometers before the finish line.
To find the distance the runner completed, we need to subtract the distance from the collapse point to the finish line from the total length of the marathon course.
Total length of the marathon course: 64 kilometers
Distance from collapse point to finish line: 5 kilometers
Distance the runner completed: 64 kilometers - 5 kilometers = &lt;&lt;64 - 5 = 59&gt;&gt;59 kilometers.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning: In the previous marathon, the runner collapsed 5 kilometers before the finish line, completing 64 - 5 = 59 kilometers.
In the current marathon, the course length is extended to 80 kilometers, and the runner again collapses 5 kilometers before the finish line.
To find the distance the runner completed in the current marathon, we need to subtract the distance from the collapse point to the finish line from the total length of the marathon course.
Total length of the marathon course: 80 kilometers
Distance from collapse point to finish line: 5 kilometers
Distance the runner completed: 80 kilometers - 5 kilometers = &lt;&lt;80 - 5 = 75&gt;&gt;75 kilometers.

* The original swimming pool's main section measured 66 meters long.
* Initially, 28 meters was added to the original length to meet competition standards.
* Now, the officials have decided to only add 27 meters instead of 28 meters.

To find the new total length of the lap pool, we need to:
* Take the original length of 66 meters
* Add the new additional length of 27 meters

New total length = Original length + New additional length
New total length = 66 meters + 27 meters

        Adam realizes he messed up his calculations. He needs to fill the hole back up by 3 meters to reach the desired depth. How deep is the hole after Adam fills it back up by 3 meters?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
* The initial hole was 67 meters deep.
* Adam needs to fill the hole back up by 3 meters to reach the desired depth.
* To find the final depth of the hole, we subtract the 3 meters that Adam filled back up:
* 67 meters - 3 meters = &lt;&lt;67 - 3 = 64&gt;&gt;64 meters.

        Recalling the previous question, Johnathon bought a 33-foot long rope to help him climb a hill in his backyard. However, imagine instead that he had shortened the rope not by 17 feet, but only by 13 feet to better suit his needs. How long would the rope be in this case?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work this out step-by-step:

* Johnathon originally bought a 33-foot long rope.
* In this new scenario, he shortened the rope by 13 feet, not 17 feet.
* To find the new length of the rope, we subtract the amount he shortened it by from the original length.
* 33 feet - 13 feet = 20 feet.

To find the total distance Bob has to cover, we need to calculate the distance after taking the shortcut.

The original distance from Bob's house to the city was 94 km.
The shortcut cuts this distance by 46 km, so the new distance is:
94 km - 46 km = 48 km

* Tom cut the first piece to be 55 inches long
* The new desired length of the table is 71 inches

   1. Find the difference between the new desired length (71 inches) and the original desired length (68 inches)
   2. Subtract the length of the first piece (55 inches) from this difference

Step 1: 
New desired length - Original desired length = 71 inches - 68 inches = 3 inches

Step 2:

* The original plan for the road length was 58 kilometers.
* In response to resident requests, 12 kilometers were removed from the construction.
* To find the revised length of the road, we need to subtract the 12 kilometers that were removed from the original 58 kilometers.

Revised length of the road = Original length - Length removed
Revised length of the road = 58 kilometers - 12 kilometers
Revised length of the road = &lt;&lt;58 - 12 = 46&gt;&gt; 46 kilometers

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The original length of the farm is 36 meters.
The farmer wants to extend the length by 10 more meters.
To find the total length of the farm after expansion, we need to add the original length and the extended length.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Reasoning:
The original length of the farm was 36 meters.
The farmer extended the length by 10 more meters, making the total length 36 + 10 = 46 meters.
The farmer now wants to add a fence that includes an extra 14 meters to accommodate a gate and some additional space.
To find the total length of the farm, including the fence, we need to add the length of the fence to the total length after the expansion.
Total length of the farm, including the fence = Total length after expansion + Length of the fence
Total length of the farm, including the fence = 46 meters + 14 meters

4) The jogging track is 15 meters longer than the combined length and width of the park.

To find the length of the jogging track, we need to first find the combined length and width of the park:
* Combined length and width = 21 meters + 45 meters = 66 meters

Now, we add 15 meters to the combined length and width to get the length of the jogging track:

4) The total length available for the bike track is 90 meters.

First, let's find the combined length and width of the park:
* Combined length and width = 21 meters + 45 meters = 66 meters

Now, let's find the length of the jogging track:
* Length of jogging track = 66 meters + 15 meters = 81 meters

Finally, let's find the difference between the available space for the bike track and the length of the jogging track:
* Available space for bike track = 90 meters

To find the length of the new jogging track, we first need to calculate the combined new length and width of the park:
* New combined length and width = 11 meters + 45 meters = 56 meters

Now, we add 15 meters to the combined new length and width to get the length of the new jogging track:

After the stop, it travels another 14 kilometers.
To find the total kilometers the train travels, we add the two distances together:
82 kilometers + 14 kilometers = 96 kilometers.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The train initially traveled 19 kilometers before making a stop.
2) After the stop, it traveled an additional 14 kilometers.
3) To find the total kilometers the train traveled, we add the two distances together:
   19 kilometers + 14 kilometers = 33 kilometers.

        There is a park measuring 79 meters in length from the entrance to the end. If a certain pathway extends 21 meters inward from the entrance gate, what is the remaining length of the park from the end of the pathway to the park's end?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The park measures 79 meters in length from the entrance to the end.
* There is a pathway that extends 21 meters inward from the entrance gate.

To find the remaining length of the park from the end of the pathway to the park's end, we need to subtract the length of the pathway from the total length of the park.

Total length of the park: 79 meters
Length of the pathway: 21 meters

Remaining length = Total length - Length of pathway
Remaining length = 79 meters - 21 meters
Remaining length = 58 meters

### Answer: 58 meters</pre>

        <span class="response-field">Problem:</span>
        Continuing from the first problem, let's say the pathway from the entrance gate was not 21 meters but now only extends into the park by 21 meters, what is the new remaining length of the park from the end of the pathway to the park's end given that the total length of the park is now reduced to 51 meters?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The total length of the park is now 51 meters.
* The pathway extends 21 meters inward from the entrance gate.

To find the remaining length of the park from the end of the pathway to the park's end, we need to subtract the length of the pathway from the total length of the park.

Total length of the park: 51 meters
Length of the pathway: 21 meters

Remaining length = Total length - Length of pathway
Remaining length = 51 meters - 21 meters
Remaining length = 30 meters

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The field is 48 meters long
* The farmer plans to plant crops in 29 meters of the field
* To find the remaining meters for other usage, we need to subtract the 29 meters used for crops from the total 48 meters

Calculation:
* 48 meters (total field length) - 29 meters (used for crops) = 19 meters

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:
* The original field length was 46 meters
* The farmer planted crops in 29 meters of the field
* To find the remaining meters for other usage, we need to subtract the 29 meters used for crops from the total 46 meters

Calculation:
* 46 meters (total field length) - 29 meters (used for crops) = 17 meters
