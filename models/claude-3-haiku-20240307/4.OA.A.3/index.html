        A songwriter creates a long ballad with many verses. Each verse has 162 words and he divides these into 18 lines per verse. This gives a certain number of words per line. To each line, he adds 34 more words as a refrain. What is the total number of words present in each line now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each verse has 162 words
* Each verse is divided into 18 lines
* This means there are 162 / 18 = 9 words per line
* The songwriter then adds a 34-word refrain to each line

To find the total number of words per line, we add the original 9 words per line to the 34-word refrain:
* 9 words per line + 34 word refrain = 43 words per line

        Following from the previous problem, the songwriter then decides to add an extra refrain to the end of each verse. If the refrain has 39 words, determine how many words are in each line after this final addition.

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

* Originally, each verse had 162 words
* The verse was divided into 18 lines, so there were 9 words per line
* A 34-word refrain was added to each line
* So the total words per line was 9 + 34 = 43 words per line

Now, the songwriter decides to add an extra 39-word refrain to the end of each verse.

To calculate the new total words per line:
* Original words per line: 9
* First refrain added: 34
* Second refrain added: 39
* Total words per line: 9 + 34 + 39 = 82 words per line

        In the previous problem, the songwriter added 34 words as the refrain to each line in his song. However, what if he had decided to keep the refrain a bit shorter and added only 28 words to each line instead? How many words would each line of the song contain in that case?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work this out step-by-step:
* Each verse has 162 words
* Each verse is divided into 18 lines
* This means there are 162 / 18 = 9 words per line
* The songwriter then adds a 28-word refrain to each line

To find the total number of words per line, we add the original 9 words per line to the 28-word refrain:
* 9 words per line + 28 word refrain = 37 words per line

        A penguin biologist counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted a different group of penguins and found there were approximately 598 divided evenly among 26 ice floes. After returning to the first place, she found that the penguin population had increased by 49. Wishing to conduct another survey, she decided to take 33 more penguins into account. However, when she counted them again, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10 from her calculations. Her final step was to add in the penguins sheâ€™d left at her base camp, which were 20 adults and 14 chicks. How many penguins did she count in total?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The biologist initially counted 35 penguins on a small ice floe.

2. In another part of the Antarctic, she counted 598 penguins divided evenly among 26 ice floes. This means there were 598/26 = 23 penguins per ice floe.

3. When she returned to the first place, the penguin population had increased by 49, so the new total was 35 + 49 = 84 penguins.

4. She decided to take 33 more penguins into account, so the new total was 84 + 33 = 117 penguins.

5. However, she realized she had overestimated and had to subtract 10, so the new total was 117 - 10 = 107 penguins.

6. Finally, she added the 20 adult penguins and 14 chicks from her base camp, so the final total was 107 + 20 + 14 = 141 penguins.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first jungle gym has a total of 27 steps.
2. The top 19 steps are blue.
3. The remaining 8 steps (27 - 19 = 8) and another 19 steps are red.
4. So the total number of red steps is 8 + 19 = 27.
5. The second jungle gym has 34 green steps.

Now, we can calculate the total number of colored steps on the two jungle gyms:
* Blue steps: 19
* Red steps: 27
* Green steps: 34
* Total colored steps: 19 + 27 + 34 = 80

        After reflecting on his kite design, the young boy realized he made a mistake. When he multiplied the number of remaining paper straws by 45, he should have subtracted 25, not 49. If he corrects this calculation error and takes out 7 final straws as before, how many straws does he have now for his kite?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's rework this with the corrected calculation:

1. The boy started with 37 paper straws.
2. He removed 4 straws, so he had 37 - 4 = 33 straws left.
3. He then removed another 23 straws, so he had 33 - 23 = 10 straws left.
4. He multiplied the remaining 10 straws by 45, which gives 10 * 45 = 450.
5. He then subtracted 25 from 450, which gives 450 - 25 = 425.
6. Finally, he removed 7 more straws, so he had 425 - 7 = 418 straws left.

        At the zoo, there were 2 trips being hosted. Each trip was allowed to see 2 animals. However, each animal had 3 baby animals with them, making the number of animals seen per trip multiplied by 3. If each baby animal could be photographed 21 times, how many photos could be taken in total? Also, if 34 photos were spoiled and unusable out of the entire batch, but guests were given the opportunity to take an additional 30 photos later, how many usable photos would there be in total?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. There were 2 trips being hosted at the zoo.
2. Each trip was allowed to see 2 animals.
3. Each animal had 3 baby animals with them, so the number of animals seen per trip was multiplied by 3.
4. Each baby animal could be photographed 21 times.

First, let's calculate the total number of photos that could be taken:
* Each trip saw 2 animals x 3 baby animals each = 6 animals per trip
* 6 animals per trip x 2 trips = 12 animals total
* 12 animals x 21 photos per baby animal = 252 photos total

### Answer: 252 photos could be taken in total.

Now, let's calculate the number of usable photos after the 34 spoiled photos and the additional 30 photos:
* 252 photos total - 34 spoiled photos = 218 usable photos
* 218 usable photos + 30 additional photos = 248 usable photos in total

First, let's calculate the total number of photos that could be taken:
* Each trip saw 2 animals x 3 baby animals each = 6 animals per trip
* 6 animals per trip x 2 trips = 12 animals total
* 12 animals x 16 photos per baby animal = 192 photos total

Now, let's calculate the number of usable photos after the 34 spoiled photos and the additional 30 photos:

        In a literacy event, a group of learners were asked to write a word from letters. In the first round, they could form a word with 47 letters, but due to a mistake, they had to remove 30 letters. Then, they figured out they could still add 10 more letters to this word. In the next round, they removed 3 of these letters from the updated word. How many letters were there in the word after this last deletion?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first round, the learners could form a word with 47 letters.
2. They then had to remove 30 letters due to a mistake, leaving them with 47 - 30 = 17 letters.
3. They were then able to add 10 more letters to the word, making it 17 + 10 = 27 letters.
4. In the next round, they removed 3 of these letters from the updated word.

So, the final number of letters in the word after the last deletion is:

3. Instead of adding 10 letters, they added 10 - 16 = -6 letters.

        A turtle named Tommy moves at 74/37 miles per hour. If Tommy maintains his current speed for a while then slows down by 3 mph, then speeds up to his initial speed again, what would be his average speed?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Tommy's initial speed is 74/37 miles per hour.
2) He then slows down by 3 mph, so his new speed is 74/37 - 3 = 71/37 miles per hour.
3) He then speeds up to his initial speed of 74/37 miles per hour again.

To calculate the average speed, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

Let's assume Tommy travels for a total of 1 hour.
* In the first part, he travels at 74/37 miles per hour for 1/2 hour.
* In the second part, he travels at 71/37 miles per hour for 1/2 hour.
* In the third part, he travels at 74/37 miles per hour for 1/2 hour.

The total distance traveled is:
* (74/37 * 1/2) + (71/37 * 1/2) + (74/37 * 1/2) = 37 + 35.5 + 37 = 109.5 miles

The total time taken is 1 hour.

Therefore, the average speed is:
* 109.5 miles / 1 hour = 109.5 miles per hour

* On the second day, the pirate found a number of rubies equal to what he found on the first day (6) plus an additional 21 rubies.
* So, the second day's haul was 6 + 21 = 27 rubies.
* To find the total number of rubies the pirate has after the second day, we add the first day's find (6) and the second day's find (27):
* 6 + 27 = 33 rubies.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* The helicopter initially travels 10 miles in 1 minute
* The helicopter then increases its speed by 40 miles
* The helicopter then increases its speed by another 20 miles
* So the total increase in speed is 40 + 20 = 60 miles
* The new speed of the helicopter is 10 + 60 = 70 miles per minute
* The helicopter travels for 12 minutes at this increased speed of 70 miles per minute

To calculate the total distance traveled in 12 minutes:
* Distance = Speed x Time

        After re-evaluating its performance, the helicopter realized that its actual speed increase was lesser than initially thought. Instead of the initial 40 miles speed increase, the increase was just 2 miles. Given that the original speed of 10 miles and an additional bonus speed of 20 miles remained the same, how far will the helicopter be able to travel in 12 minutes at this revised speed?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

* The original speed of the helicopter was 10 miles per minute
* The helicopter then increased its speed by 2 miles (not 40 miles as initially thought)
* The helicopter also had an additional bonus speed increase of 20 miles
* So the new total speed of the helicopter is:
  - Original speed: 10 miles/minute
  - Speed increase: 2 miles/minute
  - Bonus speed increase: 20 miles/minute
  - Total new speed: 10 + 2 + 20 = 32 miles/minute
* The helicopter travels for 12 minutes at this new speed of 32 miles/minute

On the other hand, they made a special batch of 13 towels for every towel left after their charity activity and deducted 19 towels from this special batch, calling it their premium collection. They then noted 20 towels were damaged and removed it from this premium collection. 

After this, they deducted 3 more towels from the remaining premium collection and combined it with the total they had after their second batch of production.

They found the difference and multiplied this difference by 7, as each of the Velociraptors laid 7 new eggs that week. How many total eggs were laid by the Velociraptors that week?

1. The park initially had 43 Velociraptors.
2. The park then added another set of dinosaurs, which numbered 972.
3. Each of these new sections contained 27 dinosaurs.
4. This meant the actual number of new dinosaur types added was less than 972.
5. After calculating the new dinosaur types, they found that the number of Velociraptors was more.
6. They found the difference and multiplied this difference by 7, as each of the Velociraptors laid 7 new eggs that week.

To find the total number of eggs laid by the Velociraptors that week, we need to:
1. Calculate the actual number of new dinosaur types added.
2. Find the difference between the initial number of Velociraptors and the new number.
3. Multiply this difference by 7 to get the total number of eggs laid.

Step 1: Calculating the actual number of new dinosaur types added.
Total new dinosaurs added = 972
Number of dinosaurs in each new section = 27
Number of new sections = 972 / 27 = 36
Therefore, the actual number of new dinosaur types added = 36

Step 2: Finding the difference between the initial number of Velociraptors and the new number.
Initial number of Velociraptors = 43
New number of Velociraptors = 43 + 36 = 79
Difference = 79 - 43 = 36

Step 3: Multiplying the difference by 7 to get the total number of eggs laid.
Total eggs laid = 36 Ã— 7 = 252

3. The increased production rate continues for 16 minutes.

First, let's calculate how many toothbrushes were produced in the initial 37 toothbrushes per minute rate:
* 37 toothbrushes per minute x 16 minutes = 592 toothbrushes

Now, let's calculate how many toothbrushes were produced at the increased rate of 308 toothbrushes every 7 minutes:
* 308 toothbrushes every 7 minutes
* 16 minutes / 7 minutes per cycle = 2.29 cycles
* 2.29 cycles x 308 toothbrushes per cycle = 704 toothbrushes

        After reviewing the inventory, the management of the research laboratory discovered that instead of adding 12 new telescopes in the third month, they had actually added 29 telescopes. How would this affect the total count of telescopes at the end of the sixth month, before any old models were decommissioned?

    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's recalculate the total number of telescopes at the end of the sixth month with the corrected information.

* Initially, the research laboratory had 39 telescopes.
* In the first month, they added 7 more telescopes.
* In the second month, they added 17 more telescopes.
* In the third month, they added 29 more telescopes (instead of 12).
* In the fourth month, they added 18 more telescopes.
* In the fifth month, they received the same number of telescopes as they had initially, which is 39.
* In the sixth month, they received 19 more telescopes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of telescopes the research laboratory has at the end of the sixth month:
* Initial number of telescopes: 39
* First month: 39 + 7 = 46
* Second month: 46 + 17 = 63
* Third month: 63 + 29 = 92
* Fourth month: 92 + 18 = 110
* Fifth month: 110 + 39 = 149

* Each robot model has 17 transistors
* Each transistor may have 16 separate connections
* One of the newly manufactured robots was made with one less connection than standard
* To compensate for the mistake, an extra 41 connections were added elsewhere

First, let's calculate the total number of connections in a standard robot:
* 17 transistors x 16 connections per transistor = 272 connections

Now, for the strangely built robot:
* One connection was missing, so that's 272 - 1 = 271 connections
* But 41 extra connections were added elsewhere

        In the assembly line, another robot was produced similar to the first. However, this time instead of adding an additional 41 connections to compensate for the one lost, the production team decided to add only 13 additional connections. How many connections does this robot have now?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Each robot model has 17 transistors
* Each transistor may have 16 separate connections
* One of the newly manufactured robots was made with one less connection than standard
* To compensate for the mistake, an extra 13 connections were added elsewhere

First, let's calculate the total number of connections in a standard robot:
* 17 transistors x 16 connections per transistor = 272 connections

Now, for the second strangely built robot:
* One connection was missing, so that's 272 - 1 = 271 connections
* But 13 extra connections were added elsewhere
* So the total number of connections in the second strangely built robot is 271 + 13 = 284

        There's this mystical ring that, after you perform a special chant, it will grant you powers based on a complex magic formula. If the first step of the magical formula is subtracting 5 from 23 and then multiplying by the number of magical chants you perform, which in this case is 6. After that, the result is multiplied by 7 and again by 1. However, for the final step, you subtract 48 from the result. If you follow these steps, how powerful will the ring's magic be?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Step 1: Subtract 5 from 23 and then multiply by the number of magical chants, which is 6.
23 - 5 = 18
18 x 6 = 108

Step 2: Multiply the result from Step 1 by 7.
108 x 7 = 756

Step 3: Multiply the result from Step 2 by 1.
756 x 1 = 756

Step 4: Subtract 48 from the result of Step 3.
756 - 48 = 708

Therefore, if you follow these steps, the ring's magic will be 708.

        Imagine in the initial mystical chant, instead of subtracting 5 from 23, you subtracted 5 from just 8, then continued with the rest of the magic formula exactly the same - multiplying by the number of chants and so forth. How would this adjustment impact the final power of the ring?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Step 1: Subtract 5 from 8 instead of 23.
8 - 5 = 3

Step 2: Multiply the result from Step 1 by the number of magical chants, which is 6.
3 x 6 = 18

Step 3: Multiply the result from Step 2 by 7.
18 x 7 = 126 

Step 4: Multiply the result from Step 3 by 1.
126 x 1 = 126

Step 5: Subtract 48 from the result of Step 4.
126 - 48 = 78

So if you subtract 5 from 8 instead of 23 in the initial chant, and continue with the rest of the magic formula, the final power of the ring would be 78.

Each pair of socks is sold for $37, so the total earnings from the sock sales is:
* 12 pairs x $37 per pair = $444

The worker also found a $13 bill on the floor.

Therefore, the total money the worker has is:
* $444 + $13 = $457

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's re-work the problem with the new information.

1. The worker started with 26 pairs of socks.
2. 50 pairs got torn and had to be discarded.
3. The worker produced 36 more pairs to replace the torn ones.

So, the total number of pairs of socks the worker had at the end is:
* 26 - 50 + 36 = 12 pairs

Each pair of socks is now sold for $40, so the total earnings from the sock sales is:
* 12 pairs x $40 per pair = $480

The worker also found a $13 bill on the floor.

Therefore, the total money the worker has is:
* $480 + $13 = $493

1. In the first two rounds, you collected 150 points each round, which were then divided by 10 to determine the number of gold coins earned.
   * Round 1: 150 points / 10 = 15 gold coins
   * Round 2: 150 points / 10 = 15 gold coins
   * Total gold coins earned in the first two rounds = 15 + 15 = 30 gold coins

2. In the third round, you collected 28 emeralds and 14 sapphires, but you had to sacrifice the same amount of gold coins as you earned in the first two rounds, which was 30 gold coins.

3. To find the number of emeralds and sapphires left after the third round, we need to subtract the number of emeralds and sapphires collected in the third round from the total number of emeralds and sapphires.

   * Emeralds collected in the third round: 28

        A candy factory has 20 different flavors of candy. Their bestselling flavors are the Sugar Rush, which has 14 different base ingredients, the Candy Twirl, which has 25 base ingredients, and the Jawbreaker, which has 16 base ingredients. They create a Special Mix which combines all of these bestsellers and adds 43 extra goodies, including sprinkles and marshmallows. To create a limited edition candy, they take a piece of the Special Mix, add 7 uniquely crafted sweets, then combine this with one of each flavor from their 20 different flavored candies (excluding 19 of them so it's not too overwhelming). They then top it all off by removing 3 experimental sweets that didn't taste quite right. What is the count of various components used in creating this limited edition candy?

        The previous problem had us determine the total number of police officers on duty under certain conditions. Now, let's imagine a slightly different scenario.

Like the previous situation, there were still 32 officers assigned to the north district and 33 sent to the south. The number for the downtown district was also the same, at 29. However, this time around, only 21 officers from the total force were transferred elsewhere instead of the original scenario's subtraction. A week later, an additional 22 officers, fewer than the 39 from the original scenario, were brought in for a different assignment. That same day, another addition of 14 officers was made, just like with the initial series of events. 

New question: How many officers total were on duty by the end of the day in this amended scenario?

1. The initial distance between the Moon and the Earth was 36 million kilometers.
2. The distance then decreased by 19 million kilometers.
   * So the new distance is 36 - 19 = 17 million kilometers.
3. The distance then increased by 11 million kilometers.
   * So the final distance is 17 + 11 = 28 million kilometers.
4. The question states that the distance, in millions of kilometers, times 19 minus 27 equals a certain value.
   * The distance is 28 million kilometers.
   * 28 x (19 - 27) = 28 x (-8) = -224.

Another tiger covered a distance combining 23 meters with a leap and a 46-meter run but then retraces the distance equal to the first tiger's steps and the leap. How much distance did the second tiger cover finally?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first tiger:
   - Average step length: 9 meters
   - Took 2 steps, so the distance covered by the steps is: 2 x 9 = 18 meters
   - Then it leaped 44 meters
   - Total distance covered by the first tiger: 18 + 44 = 62 meters

2. The second tiger:
   - Covered a distance of 23 meters
   - Then it leaped an unknown distance
   - Then it ran 46 meters
   - Then it retraced the distance equal to the first tiger's steps (18 meters) and the leap (unknown distance)

To find the total distance covered by the second tiger, we need to add up the known distances:
   - 23 meters + 46 meters = 69 meters
   - Then it retraced 18 meters (the first tiger's steps) and the unknown leap distance

        A toothpaste factory produces 26 tubes of toothpaste every hour. On Sundays, they work for 7 hours and produce additional 8 tubes of toothpaste. So, in one Sunday, they produce ((26 * 7) + 8) tubes.

The following Monday, they continue their production by adding another 31 tubes to their Sunday's total.

In parallel, in the packaging department, they have 50 empty boxes. They use 19 of them for another department, leaving them with (50 - 19) boxes.

The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is calculated by adding the packaged boxes number with Monday's production.

On Tuesday, they produced an additional 48 tubes of toothpaste. What is the total number of produced toothpaste tubes until Tuesday, inclusive?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Sunday, the factory produces:
   - 26 tubes per hour for 7 hours = 26 * 7 = 182 tubes
   - Plus an additional 8 tubes = 182 + 8 = 190 tubes

2. On Monday, they add 31 more tubes to the Sunday's total:
   - 190 + 31 = 221 tubes

3. In the packaging department:
   - They have 50 empty boxes
   - They use 19 of them for another department
   - Leaving them with 50 - 19 = 31 boxes

4. The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is the sum of the packaged boxes (31) and Monday's production (221):
   - 31 + 221 = 252 tubes

5. On Tuesday, they produced an additional 48 tubes of toothpaste.

Therefore, the total number of produced toothpaste tubes until Tuesday, inclusive, is:

Now, consider a different Sunday where they changed their production to 22 tubes every hour instead, while still working for 7 hours and producing 8 additional tubes. They continue their production on Monday by adding an additional 31 tubes. With the same scenario in the packaging department, where they started with 50 boxes and used 19 of them leaving (50 - 19) boxes. The total number of toothpaste tubes ready for packaging is calculated by adding the packaged box number with Monday's production.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. On Sunday, the factory produces:
   - 22 tubes per hour for 7 hours = 22 * 7 = 154 tubes
   - Plus an additional 8 tubes = 154 + 8 = 162 tubes

2. On Monday, they add 31 more tubes to the Sunday's total:
   - 162 + 31 = 193 tubes

3. In the packaging department:
   - They have 50 empty boxes
   - They use 19 of them for another department
   - Leaving them with 50 - 19 = 31 boxes

4. The total number of toothpaste tubes ready is the sum of the packaged boxes (31) and Monday's production (193):
   - 31 + 193 = 224 tubes

5. On Tuesday, they produced an additional 48 tubes of toothpaste.

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The star starts with 38 neutrons.
2. It then gains 4 more neutrons, so it now has 38 + 4 = 42 neutrons.
3. The total number of neutrons (42) is then multiplied by 18 to create the energy output.
4. So the energy output is 42 * 18 = 756.
5. During the explosion, the star releases the energy equivalent to 6 + 25.
6. So the additional energy released is 6 + 25 = 31.
7. The total energy emitted by the star is the energy output (756) plus the additional energy released (31).
8. Therefore, the total energy emitted by the star is 756 + 31 = 787.

        Now consider instead that the star had only 38 neutrons initially, and then it gains only 4 more. This total number is then multiplied by 10, for a lower energy output. During an explosion, it still releases additional energy equivalent to 6 plus 25. Now, how much total energy does the star emit?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1. The star starts with 38 neutrons.
2. It then gains 4 more neutrons, so it now has 38 + 4 = 42 neutrons.
3. The total number of neutrons (42) is then multiplied by 10 to create the energy output.
4. So the energy output is 42 * 10 = 420.
5. During the explosion, the star releases the energy equivalent to 6 + 25.
6. So the additional energy released is 6 + 25 = 31.
7. The total energy emitted by the star is the energy output (420) plus the additional energy released (31).
8. Therefore, the total energy emitted by the star is 420 + 31 = 451.

        A gardener planted 13 Sunflowers in his garden. The next day, he worked out that he needed to plant more, with the number being calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from that number, then added his initial sunflowers back, creating a new total. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed. By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on and the spots needed, then he doubled that total for no particular reason. How many did he end up with?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The gardener initially planted 13 sunflowers.

2. The next day, he calculated that he needed to plant more sunflowers. The number was calculated as 37 times the number of petals on one sunflower, which is 5, minus 18.
   * 37 x 5 = 185
   * 185 - 18 = 167 additional sunflowers needed

3. On the following day, he subtracted 10 flowers from the 167, then added his initial 13 sunflowers back, creating a new total.
   * 167 - 10 = 157
   * 157 + 13 = 170 sunflowers

4. Meanwhile, he figured out that in a special part of his garden, ideal for 92 orchids he had, each spot can hold 23, so he calculated how many spots needed.
   * 92 orchids / 23 spots per orchid = 4 spots needed

5. By the end of the week, he summed up the total number of plants he worked on and the spots needed, then he doubled that total for no particular reason.
   * Total plants: 170 sunflowers + 92 orchids = 262 plants

        Using the initial information from the previous problem where 18 frogs catch 21 flies each in a day (resulting in a total of 'j' flies), imagine the scenario where a particularly voracious toad comes by the next day and catches an additional 39 flies. How many flies have been caught in total over the two days then?

        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

* In the previous problem, we found that 18 frogs can catch 21 flies each in a day, resulting in a total of 378 flies caught.
* So the total number of flies caught on the first day is 378, which we can represent as 'j' flies.

Now, on the second day:
* A voracious toad comes by and catches an additional 39 flies.
* So the total number of flies caught on the second day is 'j' (the 378 flies caught by the frogs) plus the 39 flies caught by the toad.

To find the total number of flies caught over the two days, we add the flies caught on the first day (j) and the flies caught on the second day (j + 39):

Total flies caught = j + (j + 39)
            = 2j + 39

* Now, the number of frogs in the pond has increased to 46.
* Each frog can still catch 21 flies in a day.
* To find the total number of flies caught by all the frogs in a day, we need to multiply the new number of frogs (46) by the number of flies each frog can catch (21).

        A treasure chest contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds. Unfortunately, 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed. The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest. 

In another chest, there were 540 rubies which have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division. The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value.

In the same chest as the rubies, there were also 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage. The count (s) is subtracted from the new value to determine the value (m) of the remaining treasure.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first treasure chest:
   - Contains 23 emeralds and 30 diamonds
   - 39 of the stones are fake and had to be removed
   - The number of real stones left (y) is multiplied by itself and then 37 is subtracted to get a number (g) that represents the value of the chest
   - The number of real stones left (y) = 23 emeralds + 30 diamonds - 39 fake stones = 14

2. Calculating the value (g) of the first chest:
   - y = 14
   - g = y^2 - 37 = 14^2 - 37 = 196 - 37 = 159

3. The second treasure chest:
   - Contains 540 rubies
   - The rubies have been equally shared amongst 45 pirates, and then 3 are lost in the division
   - The remaining number (x) is subtracted from the value of the first chest (g) to get a new value

4. Calculating the number of rubies each pirate received:
   - 540 rubies / 45 pirates = 12 rubies per pirate
   - 3 rubies were lost in the division
   - The remaining number (x) = 540 - (45 * 12) + 3 = 540 - 540 + 3 = 3

5. Calculating the new value:
   - New value = g - x = 159 - 3 = 156

6. The second chest also contains 23 pearls and 11 zirconias, but 9 pieces had to be discarded due to damage.
   - The count (s) = 23 pearls + 11 zirconias - 9 discarded pieces = 25

7. Calculating the final value (m):

2. She wants to make an intricate design that requires her to subtract this from 26*25 square patches of red material.
   * 26 * 25 = 650 square patches of red material
   * 650 - 27 = 623 square patches of red material needed for the design

3. She then wants to compare this number to her stock of green material, which is 48*21 square patches.
   * 48 * 21 = 1,008 square patches of green material

4. She wants to subtract the number of red patches from the green patches.
   * 1,008 - 623 = 385 square patches

Therefore, the difference between her stock of green patches and the red patches now required for the design is 385 square patches.

        Lemonville is a small village known for its lemon trees. One year, the villagers picked 38 baskets of lemons from the trees near the river and 24 baskets from the ones near an old well. From the trees near the school, they picked 16 more baskets and from the trees near the mayor's house, they picked 13 more baskets. They realized that their lemons were heavier and they could extract more juice so they decided to get 35 baskets to make lemonade. If each basket of lemons could produce 14 bottles of lemonade, how many bottles of lemonade would they get from the remaining baskets?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The villagers picked:
   - 38 baskets of lemons from the trees near the river
   - 24 baskets from the ones near an old well
   - 16 more baskets from the trees near the school
   - 13 more baskets from the trees near the mayor's house
2) In total, they picked 38 + 24 + 16 + 13 = 91 baskets of lemons.
3) They decided to use 35 baskets to make lemonade.
4) That leaves 91 - 35 = 56 remaining baskets.
5) Each basket of lemons can produce 14 bottles of lemonade.
6) So the number of bottles of lemonade they would get from the remaining 56 baskets is:
   56 baskets x 14 bottles/basket = 784 bottles of lemonade.

   * This reduces his remaining journey by a certain number of days.
   * Let's call the remaining days after this change 'x'.
   * The total distance traveled is still 900 miles.
   * So, 25 * 36 = 900 and 16 * x = 900
   * Solving for x, we get x = 56.25 days.
   * This means he saved 36 - 56.25 = -20.25 days.

3. After that, he finds a shortcut which saves him an additional 4 days.
   * This means he saved 4 more days.

4. A friendly traveller advised him of another path that will save him 40 days.
   * This means he saved an additional 40 days.

5. He also saves 21 days due to good weather.
   * This means he saved an additional 21 days.

Adding up all the days saved:
-20.25 + 4 + 40 + 21 = 44.75 days

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate the rate of ticks per minute for the first clock.
The first clock ticks 504 times in 42 minutes, so the rate is:
504 ticks / 42 minutes = 12 ticks per minute

Step 2: Calculate the rate of ticks per minute for the second clock.
The second clock ticks 279 times in 31 minutes, so the rate is:
279 ticks / 31 minutes = 9 ticks per minute

Step 3: Add 34 to the rate of the second clock's ticks per minute.
9 ticks per minute + 34 = 43 ticks per minute

Step 4: Multiply the first clock's ticks per minute by 35 and then subtract 41.
12 ticks per minute x 35 = 420 ticks per minute
420 ticks per minute - 41 = 379 ticks per minute

Step 5: Subtract the rate of the second clock (after adding 34) from the manipulated rate of the first clock.
379 ticks per minute - 43 ticks per minute = 336 ticks per minute

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's re-work this with the corrected information.

Step 1: Calculate the rate of ticks per minute for the second clock.
The second clock ticks 279 times in 2 minutes, so the rate is:
279 ticks / 2 minutes = 139.5 ticks per minute

Step 2: Add 34 to the rate of the second clock's ticks per minute.
139.5 ticks per minute + 34 = 173.5 ticks per minute

Step 3: Calculate the rate of ticks per minute for the first clock.
The first clock ticks 504 times in 42 minutes, so the rate is:
504 ticks / 42 minutes = 12 ticks per minute

Step 4: Multiply the first clock's ticks per minute by 35 and then subtract 41.
12 ticks per minute x 35 = 420 ticks per minute
420 ticks per minute - 41 = 379 ticks per minute

Step 5: Subtract the modified rate of the second clock from the manipulated rate of the first clock.
379 ticks per minute - 173.5 ticks per minute = 205.5 ticks per minute

3. In the second month, the enthusiast reported seeing 41 UFOs.
4. Additionally, the enthusiast reported seeing an amount equal to the revised (actual) number of UFO sightings from the previous month, which was 14.
5. The enthusiast also reported an additional 5 UFO sightings.

So, the total number of UFO sightings reported by the enthusiast in the second month is:
41 + 14 + 5 = 60

        A cat started playing with yarn balls. In her first game, she managed to accumulate 5 yarn balls. In her second game, she got as many balls as the square of what she obtained in the first game plus 8 more. Finally, she lost some of her balls in her third game due to a playful dog. She ended the game with a number of balls which is 25 times the difference between 45 and what she accumulated from the second game. How many yarn balls does the cat have now?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the first game, the cat accumulated 5 yarn balls.

2. In the second game, the cat got as many balls as the square of what she obtained in the first game plus 8 more.
   * The square of 5 is 25.
   * 25 + 8 = 33 yarn balls in the second game.

3. In the third game, the cat lost some balls and ended up with a number of balls which is 25 times the difference between 45 and what she accumulated from the second game.
   * The difference between 45 and 33 (the number of balls from the second game) is 12.
   * 25 times 12 is 300 yarn balls.

Therefore, the cat now has 300 yarn balls.

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The basket initially contains 41 balls.
2. The balls are split into two types - tennis balls and cricket balls.
3. When 16 balls are removed, they are cricket balls.
4. 9 ping pong balls and 21 basketballs are then added to the basket.

First, let's find out how many tennis balls and cricket balls were in the basket initially:
* Total balls = 41
* Cricket balls removed = 16
* Remaining balls = 41 - 16 = 25
* Therefore, the initial number of tennis balls = 25

Now, let's add the new balls to the basket:
* Ping pong balls added = 9
* Basketballs added = 21
* Total balls in the basket = 25 + 9 + 21 = 55

3. That left 41 - 16 = 25 tennis balls in the basket.
4. Then, 9 ping pong balls were added to the basket.
5. Finally, 2 basketballs were added to the basket.

So, the total number of balls in the basket is:

        The design of a classic wall clock dictates that there should be 1 number represented for every 12 around the clock face. However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. 

They left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. 

Suddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. 

Since your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. 

Because your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. 

Can you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?

        Your clockmaker friend continues to work at their quirky clock. They thought about the previous calculation for hour squares and realized they made a mistake. Instead of subtracting 37 from the sum of the unfinished hour squares (after adding 42), they should have subtracted only 13. 

So, they re-did the maths: subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted only 13 from that total.

Everything else remained the same, including the additional 25 squares for the minutes, followed by another 28 squares for the seconds. The following calculations also didn't change: they added 41 to 25, added 28 to the result and then added 17 to the final number.

But, just like before, they realized they still lack some material and decided to go on with their decision to reduce the total number of squares by 23. In the end, they added this reduced total to the newly calculated number for hours (after subtracting 13 instead of 37).

3. The harvest period was 15 days.
4. So the total production during the 15-day harvest period was 56 pounds per day x 15 days = 840 pounds.

3. Over the 15-day harvest period, the total production would be 14 pounds per day x 15 days = 210 pounds.
4. The farm then added 16 pounds of the rare orange variant to the harvest.

        Let's reconsider the original scenario where the reserve started with ginger giraffes. But this time assume that the reserve initially had 42 ginger giraffes instead of 16. They again brought in the same number of golden giraffes as the ginger ones. Later, they decided to add another group of 46 greyish giraffes. What would be the total number of giraffes in the reserve now under this new scenario?

    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this new scenario step-by-step:

1. The reserve initially has 42 ginger giraffes.
2. They then bring in the same number of golden giraffes as they had of the ginger ones. So they bring in 42 golden giraffes.
3. Later, they add another group of 46 greyish giraffes.

To find the total number of giraffes in the reserve now, we add up the number of each type:
* Ginger giraffes: 42
* Golden giraffes: 42 
* Greyish giraffes: 46

Total number of giraffes = 42 + 42 + 46 = 130

        A turtle decides to swim. One day, it travels as many leagues as 11 plus 10, then multiplies that by 16 to get the total distance it swam that week. Later, it realized it had over calculated the distance by 41 leagues. What is the real distance it swam that week?

    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The turtle travels as many leagues as 11 plus 10.
   * So the initial distance traveled is 11 + 10 = 21 leagues.

2) The turtle then multiplies that distance by 16 to get the total distance for the week.
   * So the total distance calculated is 21 * 16 = 336 leagues.

3) The turtle later realizes it had over calculated the distance by 41 leagues.
   * So the real distance it swam that week is 336 - 41 = 295 leagues.

        Continuing from the previous scenario, consider that the turtle realizes that it originally miscalculated the daily travel distance. Instead of swimming 11 leagues plus 10 a day, it actually swam 11 leagues plus 17 leagues a day. After multiplying that daily total by 16 for the week, and subtracting the over-calculated 41 leagues, how much did the turtle actually swim in the originally estimated week?
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="response-field">Response:</span>
    </p>
    <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1) The turtle originally thought it swam 11 leagues plus 10 leagues per day.
2) But it actually swam 11 leagues plus 17 leagues per day.
3) So the correct daily distance is 11 + 17 = 28 leagues per day.
4) The turtle multiplied this daily distance by 16 for the week, so the total distance calculated was 28 * 16 = 448 leagues.
5) But the turtle had over-calculated by 41 leagues, so the real distance swam in the week is 448 - 41 = 407 leagues.
