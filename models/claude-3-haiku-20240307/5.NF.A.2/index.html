        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Kyle threw the ball for a distance of 18/4 yards.
2) To calculate this, we divide 18 by 4 to get 4.5 yards.
3) Lisa threw the same ball for a distance of 19/9 yards.
4) To calculate this, we divide 19 by 9 to get 2.11 yards.
5) To find the total distance the ball traveled, we add the distances from both Kyle and Lisa:
4.5 yards + 2.11 yards = 6.61 yards.

1) In the morning, Johnnie was given 18/7 bananas.
2) In the afternoon, Johnnie was given 12/14 bananas.
3) To find the total number of bananas, we need to add the two amounts together.

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 7 and 14 is 14.

So, 18/7 = 36/14 and 12/14 = 12/14.

Now we can add the fractions:
36/14 + 12/14 = 48/14

Simplifying the fraction, we get:
48/14 = 24/7

3) The total number of bananas given to Johnnie on the first day was:
   36/14 + 12/14 = 48/14 = 24/7 bananas

4) The zookeeper decides to give Johnnie the same total amount of bananas the next day.
5) So, the total number of bananas Johnnie received over the two days is:

2) The top of the door measures 9/10 inches from the ceiling.
3) To find the total distance of the bottom and top of the door from the floor and ceiling, respectively, we need to add these two measurements together.
4) 4/19 inches + 9/10 inches = (4/19 + 9/10) inches.
5) To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 19 and 10 is 190.
6) 4/19 = 40/190 and 9/10 = 171/190.
7) 40/190 + 171/190 = 211/190.
8) Simplifying, 211/190 = 1.1105 inches.

1) The recipe requires 17/3 liters of apple juice.
2) Ralph uses 15/11 liters of apple juice.
3) To find the amount of apple juice left unused, we need to subtract the amount used from the amount required.

First, let's convert the fractions to decimal form:
17/3 = 5.67 liters
15/11 = 1.36 liters

Now, we can subtract the amount used from the amount required:
5.67 liters - 1.36 liters = 4.31 liters

3) To find the total portion of the treasure map that he found, we need to add the two fractions together.

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 13 and 19 is 247.

So, 10/13 = 190/247 and 16/19 = 211/247.

4) 16/9 - 4/8 = (16*8 - 4*9) / (9*8) = (128 - 36) / 72 = 92/72 = &lt;&lt;92/72&gt;&gt; cubic feet.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1) Jacob has a piece of rope that is 15/12 meters long.
2) He adds a piece that is 17/17 meters long.
3) To find the total length, we need to add the two pieces together.
4) To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 12 and 17 is 204.
5) 15/12 = 125/204 and 17/17 = 204/204.
6) 125/204 + 204/204 = 329/204.
7) Simplifying the fraction, we get 329/204 = 1 125/204 meters.

The 13/4 pairs can be converted to a mixed number:

So, Mark has:

* Mark originally had 1 full pair of pants
* He also had 13/4 pairs from various incomplete sets
* He then went shopping and bought an additional 13/3 pairs of pants

To find the total number of pairs of pants he has now, we need to add all of these together.

First, let's convert the fractions to mixed numbers:
* 13/4 = 3 and 1/4
* 13/3 = 4 and 1/3

Now, we can add them all together:
* 1 full pair
* 3 and 1/4 pairs from incomplete sets
* 4 and 1/3 pairs from the new purchase

Adding these together:
* 1 + 3 and 1/4 + 4 and 1/3 = 8 and 19/12

To simplify this, we can convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
* 19/12 = 1 and 7/12

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sam's binoculars increase his range of sight by 3/14 of a mile.

2. Joe's binoculars increase his range of sight by exactly 1 mile (16/16).

3. To find their combined range increase, we need to add the two increases together.

Sam's range increase: 3/14 mile
Joe's range increase: 1 mile

Combined range increase = Sam's increase + Joe's increase
                    = 3/14 mile + 1 mile
                    = (3/14) + (16/16) mile
                    = (3 + 16)/14 mile

1) Maria uses 15/10 yards of fabric for one section of the blanket.
2) Maria uses 9/18 more yards for another section.
3) To find the total length of fabric used, we need to add the two amounts together.

First, let's convert the fractions to have a common denominator:
15/10 = 27/18
9/18 = 9/18

Now we can add the two amounts:
27/18 + 9/18 = 36/18

To simplify the final answer, we can reduce the fraction:

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In the park, there are 10 ducks that are equally distributed among 5 ponds.
   * Each pond has 10 / 5 = 2 ducks.

2. In the same park, there are 8 fish that are distributed among 10 small pools.
   * Each pool has 8 / 10 = 0.8 fish.

3. To find the total number of animals in each pond and pool combined, we add the number of ducks and fish:
   * Each pond has 2 ducks
   * Each pool has 0.8 fish
   * Total animals per pond/pool = 2 ducks + 0.8 fish = 2.8 animals

   - 13/18 + 12/18 = 25/18 tons of soap per day

3) The company plans to double their daily production, so:

1) The original length of the sleeping bag was 19/2 feet.
2) Mark decides to cut off 13/12 feet from it.
3) To find the new length, we need to subtract 13/12 feet from 19/2 feet.

To subtract the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 2 and 12 is 12.

19/2 = 19*6/12 = 114/12
13/12

Subtracting the fractions:
114/12 - 13/12 = 101/12

Therefore, the new length of the sleeping bag is 101/12 feet.

1) The jeweler initially has 5/14 pound of silver.
2) The jeweler then adds 18/19 pounds more to the supply.
3) To find the total amount of silver the jeweler has now, we need to add the two amounts together.

To add fractions with different denominators, we need to find the least common denominator (LCD). The LCD of 14 and 19 is 266.

5/14 = 95/266
18/19 = 237/266

Now we can add the two fractions:
95/266 + 237/266 = 332/266

To simplify this, we can divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 2.
332/266 = 166/133

Therefore, the jeweler now has 166/133 pounds of silver to make rings.

4) So, the turtle was 10 meters from the original starting point.
5) The turtle then decided to move an additional 15/20 of a meter in the same northward direction.

To calculate the final distance from the original starting point, we need to add the additional 15/20 of a meter to the previous distance of 10 meters.

15/20 of a meter = 0.75 meters

The final distance from the original starting point is:
10 meters + 0.75 meters = 10.75 meters

            Reconsider the previous scenario, but this time the turtle returns 15/8 of a meter back towards the starting point instead of the former 15/15 meters. Now, how many meters is the turtle from its starting point after these two movements?

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's reconsider the scenario with the updated information.

1) The turtle starts at a point.
2) It then moves 11 meters northward.
3) Next, it moves 15/8 of a meter back towards the starting point.

To calculate the final distance from the starting point, we need to consider the two movements:
* The turtle moved 11 meters northward.
* It then moved 15/8 meters back towards the starting point.

So, the final distance from the starting point is:
* 11 meters - (15/8) meters = 11 - 1.875 = 9.125 meters

1. Officer Max spends 2/6 part of an hour completing paperwork.
2. He then spends 14/7 parts of an hour patrolling the neighborhood.

To find the total time used for these two tasks, we need to add the two parts together.

2/6 part of an hour + 14/7 parts of an hour

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator is 42.

2/6 = 14/42
14/7 = 30/42

Now we can add the fractions:
14/42 + 30/42 = 44/42

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) John watched a movie for 10/12 of an hour.
2) He then watched a TV show for 3/8 of an hour.
3) To find the total time he spent watching, we need to add these two times together.

To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 12 and 8 is 24.

10/12 of an hour = 10/12 * 24/24 = 20/24 hours
3/8 of an hour = 3/8 * 24/24 = 9/24 hours

Total time spent watching = 20/24 + 9/24 = 29/24 hours

To convert this to hours, we divide 29 by 24:
29/24 = 1 hour and 5/24 hours

1) Mr. Carpenter takes 5/3 hours to build the frame.
2) He then takes an additional 10/13 hours to upholster the chair.
3) To find the total time, we add the two times together:
5/3 hours + 10/13 hours = (5/3 + 10/13) hours

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 3 and 13 is 39.

5/3 = 15/39
10/13 = 30/39

15/39 + 30/39 = 45/39

Therefore, the total time it takes Mr. Carpenter to build a chair from start to finish is 45/39 hours.

3) To find the total yards of fabric needed, we need to add the two amounts together.

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 14 and 5 is 70.

12/14 = 60/70
8/5 = 112/70

Now we can add the fractions:
60/70 + 112/70 = 172/70

To convert this to a mixed number, we divide 172 by 70 to get 2 with a remainder of 32.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) We previously calculated that Johnathan needs 2 32/70 yards of fabric in total to create the sleeping bag.
2) Johnathan had bought 17 yards of fabric in total.

To find how many yards he has left, we need to subtract the amount he used from the total amount he bought.

Total fabric bought: 17 yards
Fabric used: 2 32/70 yards

To subtract the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 70 is 70.

17 yards = 1190/70 yards
2 32/70 yards = 202/70 yards

1190/70 - 202/70 = 988/70 yards

To convert this back to a mixed number, we divide 988 by 70 to get 14 with a remainder of 8.
So the amount of fabric Johnathan has left is 14 8/70 yards.

6) 12/6 = 84/42 (since 12/6 = 12 * 7/42 = 84/42)
7) 2/14 = 6/42 (since 2/14 = 2 * 3/42 = 6/42)
8) 84/42 + 6/42 = 90/42
9) Simplifying, 90/42 = 15/7.

Difference = Summer amount - Winter amount
            = 10/4 - 12/20

1) The ballerina starts with a routine that lasts 13/5 minutes.
2) She decides to shorten the routine by 15/16 minutes.
3) To find the new length of the routine, we need to subtract the amount she shortened it by from the original length.
4) 13/5 minutes - 15/16 minutes = (13/5 - 15/16) minutes
5) To simplify this expression, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 5 and 16 is 80.

2) She uses 17/20 kg on her roses.
3) To find how much fertilizers she has left, we need to subtract the amount used on the roses from the total amount she had.

Subtracting the amounts:
19/6 kg - 17/20 kg = (19*20 - 17*6) / (6*20) kg

1) The moon is moving away from Earth by 4/16 meters every year.
2) This year, there was an additional increase of 20/6 meters.
3) To find the total change in distance this year, we need to add the two increases together.

The first increase is 4/16 meters.
The second increase is 20/6 meters.

To add these, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator is 48.

4/16 = 12/48
20/6 = 40/48

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 4 and 10 is 20.

So we convert the fractions to have a denominator of 20:
* 2/4 = 10/20
* 7/10 = 14/20

Now we can add the fractions:

To find the total combined distance, we need to add up all three distances:
* 2/4 miles + 7/10 miles + 9/14 miles

First, we need to convert the fractions to have a common denominator. The least common denominator of 4, 10, and 14 is 140.

Converting the fractions:
* 2/4 = 35/140
* 7/10 = 98/140 
* 9/14 = 90/140

Now we can add the fractions:
* 35/140 + 98/140 + 90/140 = 223/140

1. The first bottle has 8/18 gallons of milk.
2. The second bottle has 18/8 gallons of milk.

To find the total amount of milk, we need to convert both fractions to a common denominator.

The common denominator will be 18 * 8 = 144.

So, the first bottle has 8/18 * 144/144 = 64/144 gallons.
The second bottle has 18/8 * 144/144 = 324/144 gallons.

Now we can add the two amounts together:
64/144 + 324/144 = 388/144 gallons.

To simplify the final answer, we can convert 388/144 to a mixed number:

1. From the previous question, we found that Lisa had a total of 2 + 100/144 gallons of milk from the first two bottles.

2. Now, Lisa has found a third bottle with 6/16 gallons of milk.

To find the total amount of milk, we need to convert all the fractions to a common denominator.

The common denominator will be 16 * 144 = 2304.

So, the first two bottles have a total of:
(2 * 2304/144) + (100/144 * 2304/144) = 4608/144 + 1600/144 = 6208/144 gallons.

The third bottle has 6/16 * 2304/2304 = 288/2304 gallons.

Now we can add the three amounts together:
6208/144 + 288/2304 = 6496/144 gallons.

To simplify the final answer, we can convert 6496/144 to a mixed number:

1) The 1/10 of the tree's height growth:
   - Let's say the tree's initial height was 10 feet.
   - 1/10 of 10 feet = 1 foot.
2) The additional 12/6 feet growth from the fertilizer:

2) The smaller tent occupies an area of 8/20 acres.
3) To find the total area occupied by both tents, we need to add the areas of the two tents together.

To add the areas, we need to convert them to the same unit. Let's convert both to acres.

The area of the large tent is 13/11 acres.
The area of the smaller tent is 8/20 acres, which can be simplified to 2/5 acres.

Now we can add the areas:
13/11 acres + 2/5 acres = (13 * 5) / (11 * 5) + 2/5 = 65/55 + 2/5 = 67/55 acres.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The treasure map shows the treasure is (17 / 20) km to the East from the starting point.
2) The treasure map also shows the treasure is (15 / 3) km to the North from the starting point.
3) To calculate the total distance traveled, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem.
4) The distance to the East is (17 / 20) km.
5) The distance to the North is (15 / 3) km.
6) Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   Total distance = sqrt((17/20)^2 + (15/3)^2)
   = sqrt((17^2/400) + (225/9))
   = sqrt((289/400) + (25))
   = sqrt(314/400)
   = sqrt(0.785) km

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Sarah collected 11/20 of a pound of firewood.
2) Alex collected 9/7 pounds of firewood.
3) To find the total amount of firewood collected, we need to add these two amounts together.

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 20 and 7 is 140.

So, 11/20 = 77/140 and 9/7 = 90/140.

Now we can add the fractions:
77/140 + 90/140 = 167/140

To convert this to a mixed number, we divide 167 by 140 to get 1 and a remainder of 27/140.

So the total amount of firewood collected is 1 27/140 pounds.

69/15 miles north - 20/17 miles south = (69 * 17 - 20 * 15) / (15 * 17) miles

1) The restaurant uses 19/17 pounds of ham per sandwich.
2) The restaurant uses 9/4 pounds of turkey per sandwich.
3) To find the total weight of the two types of meat per sandwich, we add the weights together:
   Total weight = 19/17 pounds of ham + 9/4 pounds of turkey
4) To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 17 and 4 is 68.
5) 19/17 = 76/68 and 9/4 = 17/4 = 68/17
6) Total weight = 76/68 + 68/17 = 144/68 + 68/17 = 212/68 + 4 = 216/68

1) The original sleeping bag was 18/19 meter long.
2) Lucy got an extension that made the sleeping bag 8/11 meter longer.
3) To find the total length of the sleeping bag now, we need to add the original length and the extension length.

The original length was 18/19 meter.
The extension length was 8/11 meter.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 19 and 11 is 209.

18/19 = 209/209
8/11 = 171/209

108/63 + 21/63 = 129/63

To simplify the final answer, we can convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
129/63 = 2 3/63

Therefore, the total time John spent working on the watch is 2 3/63 hours.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's add the additional time John spent adjusting the watch mechanism.

Previously, we calculated that John spent:
2 3/63 hours fixing and polishing the watch

Now, he spends an additional 12/13 hours adjusting the mechanism.

To find the total time, we need to add the two times together:

2 3/63 hours + 12/13 hours

To add the mixed numbers and fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 63 and 13 is 819.

2 3/63 hours = (2 * 13 + 3)/63 * 13 = 29/819 hours
12/13 hours = 12/13 * 63/63 = 567/819 hours

Now we can add the two times together:
29/819 hours + 567/819 hours = 596/819 hours

To simplify the final answer, we can convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:
596/819 hours = 0 hours 596/819

Therefore, the total time John spent working on the watch overall is 0 hours 596/819.

1) John spent 12/7 hours fixing the watch.
2) He then spent an additional 3/15 hours polishing the watch.
3) To find the total time spent, we need to add the two times together.

To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 7 and 15 is 105.

12/7 = 12 * 15/15 * 7 = 180/105
3/15 = 3 * 7/7 * 15 = 21/105

Now we can add the two times together:
180/105 + 21/105 = 201/105

To simplify the final answer, we can convert the improper fraction to a mixed number:

3) To find the total amount of fabric used, we need to add the red and blue fabric together.

To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 4 and 17 is 68.

11/4 = 17/68 (multiplying the numerator and denominator by 17/17)
5/17 = 4/68 (multiplying the numerator and denominator by 4/4)

The first rainfall lasted for 4/13 hours.
The second rainfall lasted for 11/5 hours.

To find the total time it rained, we need to add these two durations together.

To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 13 and 5 is 65.

4/13 = 20/65
11/5 = 143/65

Now we can add the two durations:
20/65 + 143/65 = 163/65

To convert this to a mixed number, we divide 163 by 65 to get 2 with a remainder of 33.

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

On the first day:
* The first rainfall lasted for 4/13 hours
* The second rainfall lasted for 11/5 hours
* Total time it rained on the first day = 4/13 + 11/5 = 20/65 + 143/65 = 163/65 = 2 and 33/65 hours

On the second day: 
* The rainfall lasted for 11/19 hours

To find the total amount of hours it rained over the two days, we add the time from the first day and the second day:

Total time it rained = 2 and 33/65 hours + 11/19 hours

To add these, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 65 and 19 is 1235.

2 and 33/65 = (130 + 33)/1235 = 163/1235
11/19 = 65/1235

163/1235 + 65/1235 = 228/1235

        <pre class="model-raw-response">Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Jane first cuts 10/12 yards of fabric from the blanket.
2) Then, she cuts an additional 10/10 yard.
To find the total amount of fabric cut, we need to add these two amounts together.

10/12 yards + 10/10 yards = (10/12) + (10/10) = (10 * 10/12) + (10/10) = (100/120) + (100/100) = 200/120 = 5/3 yards.

1) The fairy sprinkled 11/12 oz of magic dust over an enchanted field.
2) She then sprinkled an additional 9/10 oz of dust over a grove of enchanted apple trees.
3) To find the total amount of magic dust used, we need to add these two amounts together.

11/12 oz = 55/60 oz
9/10 oz = 54/60 oz

Now we can add the two amounts:

1) The original letter was 4/1 pages long.
2) You removed 14/9 pages from it.
3) To find the new length of the letter, we need to subtract the 14/9 pages from the original 4/1 pages.

To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 1 and 9 is 9.

4/1 = 36/9

4) Carl then painted an additional 11/5 of the table.

To find the total amount of the table that has been painted, we need to add the fractions together:
21/20 + 11/5 

To add these fractions, we first need to convert them to have the same denominator:

11/5 = 22/20

1. The star Alpha shines 17/3 times brighter than an average star.
2. The star Bravo shines 20/16 times as bright as an average star.

To find the total relative brightness of both stars, we need to add up their individual relative brightnesses.

Star Alpha's relative brightness: 17/3
Star Bravo's relative brightness: 20/16

Adding these together:
17/3 + 20/16 = (17 * 16) / (3 * 16) + (20 * 3) / (16 * 3)
= 272/48 + 60/48

2. Now, star Alpha shines 8/3 times brighter than an average star.
3. Star Bravo still shines 20/16 times as bright as an average star.

To find the total relative brightness of both stars now, we need to add up their individual relative brightnesses.

Star Alpha's new relative brightness: 8/3
Star Bravo's relative brightness: 20/16

Adding these together:

To find the total kilograms of apples, we need to convert the fractions to a common denominator and then add them together.

The common denominator is 20 (the least common multiple of 20 and 8).

17/20 kg of red apples = 17 kg

In the first hour, the shark swims 3/9 miles.

In the second hour, the shark's speed increases to 13/5 miles.

To find the total distance the shark swims in the two hours, we need to add the distances from each hour:

Distance in first hour: 3/9 miles
Distance in second hour: 13/5 miles

Total distance = 3/9 + 13/5
To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator.
The least common denominator is 45.

3/9 = 15/45
13/5 = 39/45

To find the time it takes for the drummer to hit the two beats together, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two time intervals.

The LCM of 17/17 and 2/12 is:

3) To find how many gallons of red paint she has left, we need to subtract the amount she used from the total amount she had.

First, let's convert 16/10 gallons to a decimal:
16/10 = 1.6 gallons

Now, let's subtract the amount she used (1/20 gallon) from the total amount she had (1.6 gallons):
1.6 gallons - 1/20 gallon = 1.6 - 0.05 = 1.55 gallons

### Answer: 1.55 gallons</pre>

* The first slide is 6/19 meters long
* The second slide is 17/4 meters long

To find the total distance the child slid, we need to add the lengths of the two slides together.

The length of the first slide is 6/19 meters.
The length of the second slide is 17/4 meters.

To add these together, we need to find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 19 and 4 is 76.

6/19 = 24/76
17/4 = 32/76
