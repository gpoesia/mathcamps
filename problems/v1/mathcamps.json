However, your quirky modernist clockmaker friend wants to do things differently. They want to represent 37 hours on the clock's face, each hour has an equivalent of 1 square. Your friend has already completed 32 squares. \n\nThey left their project for a while, and when they came back, they forgot how many squares they needed to fulfill their quirk. So they did some math to figure it out: they subtracted 32 from 37, added 42 to the result, and then subtracted 37 from that total. \n\nSuddenly, an idea occurred to them. What if they add 25 more squares for representing minutes on their quirky clock? Plus, they also wanted to add another 28 squares for seconds. \n\nSince your friend is a bit forgetful, they forgot how many squares they need again to finish their project. So, they did a little more math - added 41 to 25, followed by another 28, and then added 17 to the result. \n\nBecause your friend didn't have enough material, they decided that they could reduce the total number of squares by 23. Finally, they added the number they figured out at the beginning (for hours) to this reduced number. \n\nCan you help your friend figure out how many squares they would need in total to complete their quirky clock?",

The following calculations also didn't change: they added 41 to 25, added 28 to the result and then added 17 to the final number.\n\nBut, just like before, they realized they still lack some material and decided to go on with their decision to reduce the total number of squares by 23.
